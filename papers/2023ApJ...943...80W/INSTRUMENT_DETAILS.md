## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on investigating the pre-eruptive magnetic properties at the footprints of erupting magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The study analyzes 28 MFRs erupting within 45 degrees from the disk center from 2010 to 2015, using high-quality vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The research aims to identify the progenitors of MFRs and explore the magnetic characteristics associated with these progenitors before their eruptions. Key findings include the identification of significant non-neutralized electric currents in some MFRs and the observation of pre-eruptive dimmings at the footprints, which suggest the pre-existence of MFRs. The study also examines the evolution of conjugate dimmings and electric currents within the footprints, providing insights into the internal structure of MFRs and their formation mechanisms.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is crucial for providing high-resolution data on the solar magnetic field. In this study, it is used to analyze vector magnetograms to calculate magnetic properties at the footprints of MFRs prior to their eruptions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of erupting MFRs from 2010 to 2015
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2015
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here we analyze 28 MFRs erupting within 45 deg from the disk center from 2010 to 2015."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided context
   - **Supporting Quote**: N/A
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic fields, electric currents
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We then calculate magnetic properties at the feet of the MFRs, prior to their eruptions, using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) vector magnetograms."
- **Additional Comments**: The study utilizes the vector magnetograms from HMI to investigate the magnetic fields and associated electric currents at the footprints of MFRs, which are crucial for understanding the pre-eruptive conditions leading to solar eruptions.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provides multi-wavelength observations of the sun's atmosphere, which are essential for studying coronal dimmings associated with solar eruptions.

#### Data Collection Period: 2010 to 2016
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2016
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We have examined 400 two-ribbon flares of GOES class C5.0 and larger from a database RibbonDB (Kazachenko et al. 2017), which includes all flares of GOES class C1.0 and larger, observed by the Atomspheric Imaging Assemly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO from 2010 to 2016."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Seven EUV passbands (specific wavelengths not detailed)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "First of all, our method will analyze seven EUV passbands of AIA observations synchronously to seek possible coronal dimming regions."
- **Physical Observables**: Coronal dimmings, flare ribbons
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In the next step, our method will examine the location of detected dimmings, selecting the dimmed regions that occur along the two flare ribbons. The flare ribbons are detected in the AIA 1600 channel using the method from Qiu et al. (2007)."
- **Additional Comments**: The AIA data is used to detect and analyze coronal dimmings and flare ribbons, which are key to understanding the dynamics of MFRs and their associated solar eruptions.
