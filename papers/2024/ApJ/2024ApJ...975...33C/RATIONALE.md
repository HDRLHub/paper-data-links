produce the script. We need to construct queries for the IRIS and HMI instruments based on the context provided. The IRIS instrument is used to obtain Si IV 1403 Å spectra, and the HMI instrument is used for photospheric vector magnetic field measurements. We will focus on the specific time range mentioned for IRIS, which is October 21, 2013. For HMI, we will assume the same date for simplicity, as the exact times are not specified. We will ensure that the queries reflect the data used in the context, focusing on the time range and instrument.

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for the observations
time_range_iris = a.Time('2013-10-21', '2013-10-22')  # IRIS observation date
time_range_hmi = a.Time('2013-10-21', '2013-10-22')   # HMI observation date

# Define the instrument attributes
instrument_iris = a.Instrument('IRIS')
instrument_hmi = a.Instrument('HMI')

# Define the wavelength for IRIS Si IV 1403 Å
wavelength_iris = a.Wavelength(1403 * u.Angstrom, 1403 * u.Angstrom)

# Query for IRIS data
iris_query = Fido.search(time_range_iris, instrument_iris, wavelength_iris)
print("IRIS Query Results:")
print(iris_query)

# Query for HMI data
# Note: Wavelength is not applicable for HMI vector magnetic field data
hmi_query = Fido.search(time_range_hmi, instrument_hmi, a.Physobs('vector_magnetic_field'))
print("HMI Query Results:")
print(hmi_query)

# Uncomment the following lines to fetch the data
# iris_download = Fido.fetch(iris_query)
# hmi_download = Fido.fetch(hmi_query)
```

This script sets up queries for both the IRIS and HMI instruments based on the context provided. It specifies the time range and relevant attributes for each instrument, ensuring that the queries are aligned with the data used in the study. The script is explicit and well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify if needed.
