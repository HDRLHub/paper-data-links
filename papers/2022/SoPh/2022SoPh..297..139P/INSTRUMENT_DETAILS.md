## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper analyzes the characteristics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) during Solar Cycles 23 and 24, focusing on their association with decameter-hectometer (DH) type II radio bursts. The study uses data from the Near-Earth ICME catalogue, Wind/WAVES, and STEREO/WAVES to understand the near-Earth and geoeffective aspects of ICMEs. The paper finds a significant reduction in ICME occurrences in Solar Cycle 24 compared to Cycle 23, despite a similar fraction of type II ICMEs in both cycles. The study also examines the speed, transit time, and geomagnetic impact of ICMEs, revealing that type II ICMEs maintain higher speeds and have a stronger correlation with geomagnetic storms.
