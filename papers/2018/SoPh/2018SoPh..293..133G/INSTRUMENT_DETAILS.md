## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study presents a comprehensive multi‐wavelength analysis of the far‐side SOL2014-09-01 solar eruptive event using observations from several instruments distributed over different vantage points (near‐Earth, Mars, and STEREO). The paper focuses on recorded hard X‐ray (HXR), microwave, and >100 MeV γ–ray emissions together with EUV and white–light imaging of the eruptive flux rope and associated coronal mass ejection (CME). Detailed timing of HXR peaks, radio bursts, and evolving EUV wave and shock–wave fronts are used to examine the processes of particle acceleration and long–term trapping in closed magnetic loops. The authors also discuss the kinematics of the shock front as observed in coronagraph images and dynamic radio spectra, which together support a scenario of impulsively excited, decelerating shock waves accompanying the eruptions.
