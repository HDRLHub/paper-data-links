## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents early‐time observations of GRB 141220A using a suite of space‐ and ground‐based instruments. The optical afterglow was monitored from seconds up to thousands of seconds after the burst using the Liverpool Telescope’s instruments – notably the RINGO3 optical polarimeter/imager, SkyCam‑Z, and IO:O – as well as complementary high‐energy instruments such as Swift BAT and Swift XRT. Additional gamma‐ray data from Fermi GBM and Konus‑Wind, plus optical follow‐up by the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and Swift UVOT, help constrain the burst’s prompt emission and afterglow evolution. Detailed polarization measurements in the optical bands during 129.5–204.3 s post‑burst form the core of the study, with the decay indices and spectral information further supporting a classical forward shock scenario.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
- **General Comments**:  
  - BAT is a gamma‑ray detector onboard the Swift satellite. It triggered on GRB 141220A and provided the initial gamma‑ray light curve and timing information, including pulse structure and overall duration.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "On 2014 December 20 at T0 = 06:02:52.7 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; Cummings et al. 2014) was triggered by the detection of a pulse of 𝛾‑rays ... The pulses lasted from T0 −0.9 s to T0 + 7.3 s and consisted of one structured peak —centred at ∼T0+0.5 s— followed by two fainter ones at ∼T0 + 3.5 s and ∼T0 + 6.0 s. The emission was detectable until ∼30 s post‑burst."

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "At 87.2 s after the burst, the Swift X‑ray Telescope (XRT; Gompertz et al. 2014) also started observing the ﬁeld. The XRT light curve has two distinct segments separated by a gap in observations: the ﬁrst 57 s were done in Windowed Timing (WT) mode, whilst the steepest decay was observed in Photon Counting (PC) mode."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: X‑ray Afterglow – Initial Segment

### 4. RINGO3 Optical Polarimeter and Imager (Liverpool Telescope)
- **General Comments**:  
  - RINGO3 is a three‑band optical polarimeter and imager mounted on the 2‑m fully autonomous robotic Liverpool Telescope. It employs a spinning polaroid and dichroics to split the light into three optical bands (BV, R, I) with fast-readout cameras. Its role in this paper is central, as it measures the early-time optical polarization and photometry.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "At 129.5 s post‑burst, the 2‑m LT reacted automatically to Swift alert with the three-band optical polarimeter and imager RINGO3 ... The BV band provides the highest S/N for the time window 129.5−204.3 s post‑burst with polarization 𝑃𝐵𝑉= 2.8+2.0−1.6 % at a 2σ conﬁdence level."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Early-Time Polarization Measurement
- **Time Range**: 129.5 s to 204.3 s post‑burst (corresponding to 55.9–88.1 s in the GRB rest‑frame)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "the BV band provides the highest S/N for the time window 129.5−204.3 s post‑burst with polarization 𝑃𝐵𝑉= 2.8+2.0−1.6 % at a 2σ conﬁdence level."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - BV band (roughly covering blue and visual wavelengths), along with R and I bands in later frames.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "The RINGO3 instrument employs a spinning polaroid and two dichroic that split the light beam into three optical bands (Arnold et al. 2012)."
- **Physical Observable**: Optical polarization degree and angle, along with photometric light curves.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Subsequent observations in the BV band extend with 2σ upper limits until 726 s post‑burst. Frame integrations in the R and I bands begin at T0+200 s, with photometry accepted up to ~1350 s (R) and ~1200 s (I) post‑burst.

### 5. SkyCam‑Z (Liverpool Telescope – Auxiliary Instrument)
- **General Comments**:  
  - SkyCam‑Z is a white‑band imaging camera attached to the Liverpool Telescope mount, providing continuous wide‑field monitoring. It operates with a 1°×1° field-of-view, taking a single 10‑s exposure every minute.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "The SkyCam‑Z telescope is attached to the LT mount and continuously monitors LT ﬁeld‑of‑view with a 1◦× 1◦ coverage in a white band —taking a single exposure of 10 s every minute. The SkyCam‑Z started the ﬁrst 10‑s exposure of GRB 141220A ﬁeld at 86 s post‑burst..."

However, the LT telescope was still slewing towards the target at that time and the ﬁrst frame has trails; we correct the ﬂux oﬀset of the ﬁrst frame with the succeeding SkyCam‑Z observation (at T0 +145 s)..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White band (broad optical)
- **Physical Observable**: Early optical photometry for flux calibration and monitoring.

### 6. IO:O Optical Imager (Liverpool Telescope)
- **General Comments**:

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "The IO:O observations started at T0+2002 s with the r filter. Given that the OT is detected at S/N ∼100 per frame, we individually derive the OT ﬂux."
