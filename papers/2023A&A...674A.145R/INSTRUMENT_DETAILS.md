## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a statistical study of the relations between the properties of solar energetic electron (SEE) events measured by the MESSENGER mission from 2010 to 2015 and the parameters of the respective parent solar activity phenomena. The study aims to identify potential correlations between SEE events and solar activity parameters such as flare intensity, CME speed, and CME-driven shock speed. The analysis uses data from various instruments on board different spacecraft, including MESSENGER, STEREO, SOHO, SDO, and GOES. The study finds that both flare and shock-related processes may contribute to the acceleration of near-relativistic electrons in large SEE events.

## Instrumentation Details

### Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) on board MESSENGER
- **General Comments**:
   - The EPS instrument on MESSENGER measured electrons from approximately 25 keV to 1 MeV. It was used to identify and analyze SEE events, focusing on near-relativistic electron peak intensities and energy spectra.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of SEE events
- **Time Range**: February 7, 2010 – April 30, 2015
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The study includes MESSENGER data from 2010 February 7 to 2015 April 30."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The EPS instrument on board MESSENGER measured electrons from ∼25 keV to ∼1 MeV."
- **Physical Observable**: Near-relativistic electron peak intensities and energy spectra
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The electron energies chosen in Paper I for the SEE event identification and statistical analysis were 71-112 keV. In the case of the analysis of energy spectra, the energies used were from ∼71 keV to ∼1 MeV divided into six energy bins."
- **Additional Comments**: The EPS instrument was mounted on the far side of the spacecraft, with a field of view divided into six sectors pointing in the antisunward direction.
