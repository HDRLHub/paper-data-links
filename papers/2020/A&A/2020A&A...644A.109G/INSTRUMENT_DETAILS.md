## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper derives a reference quiet‐Sun Lyman‑α spectral profile from SOHO/SUMER observations taken during a minimum of solar activity (June 24–26, 2008). The authors use eight raster scans from SOHO/SUMER to characterize the spatially averaged Lyman‑α line distribution over various regions of the solar disk. They further discuss the variation of the Lyman‑α (and higher Lyman lines) with the solar cycle using the LISIRD composite Lyman‑α index, and they assess the effect of using time‐dependent incident radiation on the output of radiative transfer models (including synthetic profiles of Lyman‑α, Lyman‑β, Lyman‑γ, and Hα lines). In addition, the paper references a number of past spectroscopic observations (with instruments onboard OSO‑8, Skylab, SMM, and rocket payloads) and uses Hα full‑disk images from ground‑based facilities (Big Bear Solar Observatory and SMART at Hida Observatory) for contextual information.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SOHO/SUMER on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - This is the primary instrument used in the paper to obtain quiet‑Sun Lyman‑α raster scans. It provided high‑resolution spectral observations of the solar disk without the use of the attenuator (by using a partially closed aperture door to reduce incoming flux), which helped avoid non‑linear radiometric calibration effects.
  - It operated in the extreme ultraviolet and recorded the Lyman‑α line at a central wavelength of 1215.67 Å.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “In the present paper, we used the quiet-Sun Lyman-α observations that were obtained over three consecutive days between June 24 and 26, 2008. This set of eight SOHO/SUMER raster scans allows us to derive the reference quiet-Sun Lyman-α spectra unaﬀected by the geo-corona.”
