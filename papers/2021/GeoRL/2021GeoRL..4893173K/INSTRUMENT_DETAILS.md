## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the origin of magnetosheath jets in the quasi-perpendicular (Qper) region of Earth’s magnetosheath. It distinguishes between jets produced by shock rippling in the quasi‐parallel (Qpar) magnetosheath versus other phenomena—specifically magnetic flux tubes connected to the Qpar bow‐shock, non‐reconnecting current sheets (CS), reconnection exhausts (RE) and mirror mode (MM) waves. Data from three multi‐spacecraft missions (Cluster, THEMIS, and MMS) are used. The instruments onboard these spacecraft provided high‐resolution measurements of the magnetic field, ion moments, and plasma parameters during clearly defined events (with time intervals such as 21:20:30–21:21:45 UT for Cluster flux tube observations, a ∼15‐minute flux tube event, a non‐reconnecting CS event on 16 November 2015 between 03:31:35–03:35:02 UT, a 32-second reconnection exhaust on 31 October 2010 from THEMIS-E, and a 10-minute mirror mode interval on 6 November 2015). These observational periods are integral to linking different physical observables (B-field, ion density, temperatures, velocity, dynamic pressure) with the formation mechanisms of the jets.
