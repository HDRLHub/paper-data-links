## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates solar chromospheric emission during Carrington cycle 24, placing its behavior in a historical and stellar context. The primary data source is high-resolution spectra obtained with the HEROS spectrograph on the TIGRE 1.2 m robotic telescope, first at Hamburg Observatory in 2008/09 and subsequently at La Luz Observatory in Guanajuato, Mexico (since 2013). These lunar and sky-scattered sunlight observations enable direct comparison of the Sun’s Ca II H&K chromospheric emission (as measured by the S-index) with stellar activity indices from the Mount Wilson program and other observatories. The paper also incorporates supporting solar data from the NSO/SOLIS Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) and SORCE/SOLSTICE UV irradiance records, along with sunspot and radio flux indices, but direct data collection central to the results is by TIGRE/HEROS.

## Instrumentation Details

### HEROS Spectrograph on board TIGRE 1.2 m Robotic Telescope
- **General Comments**:
  - HEROS, a high-resolution echelle spectrograph (R ≈ 20,000, spectral coverage ≈3800 Å to 8800 Å), was used on the 1.2 m TIGRE robotic telescope, initially located at Hamburg Observatory (2008/09 campaign) and later at La Luz Observatory in Guanajuato, Mexico (since 2013). TIGRE was employed to acquire disk-integrated solar spectra using lunar and sky-scattered sunlight to measure the chromospheric Ca II H&K S-index.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We use our TIGRE 1.2 m robotic telescope located in Gua- najuato, central Mexico, and its HEROS spectrograph (spec- tral resolution ≈20000, with a spectral coverage of ≈3800 ˚A to 8800 ˚A); this facility is described in detail by Schmitt et al. (2014)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Hamburg Observatory (Solar Minimum 2008/09)
- **Time Range**: 2008–2009 (solar minimum of cycle 24, including March 8, 2009 Moon spectrum)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The first campaign was undertaken in the season 2008/09 with TIGRE still located at the Ham- burg Observatory, then called Hamburg Robotic Telescope (HRT)."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We carried out the same exercise for Mar 8th 2009, since on this day we obtained one of the two Moon light spectra from Hamburg with a very low S-index of 0.152±0.006."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ca II H&K lines (centred on 3934 Å and 3968 Å), observations span 3800 Å – 8800 Å range
  - **Supporting Quote**: "NH and NK are the counts measured in a 1 ˚A wide window, each centred on the Ca II H&K line cores, and NR and NV are the counts in two 20 ˚A wide, “quasi-continuum” reference bands centred on 3901 ˚A and 4001 ˚A, conveniently encompassing the two Ca II lines in between."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar chromospheric Ca II H&K S-index (disk-integrated emission)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Lunar light is used to obtain full-disk solar (i.e., Sun as a star) spectra typically twice a week whenever possible. In this way we study the Sun with the same equipment as used for a set of standard stars (and program stars of our stellar chromospheric activity survey)..."
- **Additional Comments**: 
  - Most Hamburg 2008/09 observations used sky-scattered sunlight with Ring-effect correction; only two direct Moon spectra available.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "In the observa- tions taken in 2008/09 at Hamburg, only two direct Moon spectra could be obtained. The majority of the Hamburg observations uses sky-scattered sunlight."

#### Data Collection Period 2: La Luz Observatory (Solar Maximum and Decline, Aug 2013 onward)
- **Time Range**: August 2013–2016 (cycle 24 maximum and subsequent years)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the maximum of Carrington cycle 24 was covered from Aug. 2013 onwards, after the installation of TIGRE at the La Luz Observatory near Guanajuato."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the La Luz Observatory since 2013. Therefore, we use two separate S-index calibrations to handle possible longterm instrumental drifts..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ca II H&K lines (centred on 3934 Å and 3968 Å), observations span 3800 Å – 8800 Å range
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the HEROS spectrograph (spectral resolution ≈20000, with a spectral coverage of ≈3800 ˚A to 8800 ˚A)..."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar chromospheric Ca II H&K S-index (disk-integrated emission)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The best and simplest way to obtain the S-index of the Sun are observa- tions of lunar light, where the Moon is used as a ”mirror” for the incident solar radiation."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - All La Luz data obtained via lunar reflection; calibration uses same star set as Mt. Wilson.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The method described above has been used for the data taken since 2013 at the La Luz site."

### Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) on board SOLIS Facility, NSO/Kitt Peak
- **General Comments**:
  - The ISS on the SOLIS facility at NSO/Kitt Peak provided disk-integrated solar Ca II K line observations (K 1-Å index, not S-index) from late 2006 onward; the data is compared to TIGRE but not used as the main result foundation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "After October 1, 2015, the measurements were continued using the Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) on the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) facility. The ISS has actually been in operation since late 2006 at NSO/Kitt Peak, so that there is an overlap of about eight years between the two time series."
- **Supporting Quote**: "In Fig. 8 we show the monthly medians of their re-calibrated data; obviously, the minimum in NSO 1-˚A Ca II K emission index time series is clearly lower in 2008/09 than in the minimum in 1997, consistent with the TIGRE S-index data. Unfortunately, SOLIS is not able to measure the S-index directly and cannot perform measurements of stars, therefore the stellar dimension is missing from those measurements."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Ongoing Ca II K 1-Å index time series
- **Time Range**: October 1, 2015–2016 (ISS/SOLIS continuity); Ca II K index data comparison for 2008/09–2016
  - **Supporting Quote**: "After October 1, 2015, the measurements were continued using the Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) on the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) facility. The ISS has actually been in operation since late 2006 at NSO/Kitt Peak, so that there is an overlap of about eight years between the two time series."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ca II K line, 3934 Å (1-Å wide index)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "measuring in particu- lar the so-called 1-˚A Ca II K emission index, deﬁned as the equivalent width of a band with a width of 1-˚A centered on the K-line core."
- **Physical Observable**: Disk-integrated solar Ca II K 1-Å emission index
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the minimum in NSO 1-˚A Ca II K emission index time series is clearly lower in 2008/09 than in the minimum in 1997, con- sistent with the TIGRE S-index data."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Used for context/comparison, not for direct S-index determination.

### SOLSTICE Instrument on board SORCE Satellite
- **General Comments**:
  - SOLSTICE/SORCE provided far-UV (FUV) solar spectral irradiance data (200–280 nm) from space. The data are used for comparison with S-index changes to relate chromospheric emission to UV output, not as primary data source.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We next use the SOLSTICE data of the SORCE mission, provided by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and SpacePhysics (LASP) of the University of Colorado. These far UV spectral irradiance measures are of special interest, because a “haze” of metal lines (Anderson & Athay 1989) should reveal magnetic chromospheric heating by radiative losses, similar to the S-index, and like the latter, SOLSTICE data are star-calibrated, with the consequence that they do not suﬀer from calibration lamp and/or electronics degradation problems (see the discussion by Lockwood 2011 and references therein)."
- **Supporting Quote**: "We integrate spectral irradiance over the wavelength range of 200 to 280 nm, which by wavelength and intensity is the relevant spectral window for stratospheric warming by photodissociation of molecules such as ozone and show (in Fig. 10) the averages obtained for periods of half a year, to minimize the impact of short-term ﬂuctuations of the solar activity, covering the time-span of 2003 to 2016."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SORCE/SOLSTICE FUV monitoring
- **Time Range**: 2003–2016, half-year averages
  - **Supporting Quote**: "covering the time-span of 2003 to 2016."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 200–280 nm (far ultraviolet)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We integrate spectral irradiance over the wavelength range of 200 to 280 nm"
- **Physical Observable**: Solar far-UV spectral irradiance (total integrated flux, 200–280 nm)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the maximal far-UV irradiation in cycle 24 is, like the S-index, again exceptionally low: With a total variation of only 1.4%, the cycle 24 maximum level compares with the cycle 23 decline of late 2004."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Data analyzed for correspondence with TIGRE/HEROS S-index; FUV changes contextualized with surface and atmospheric phenomena.
