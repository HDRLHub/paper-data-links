## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates how “hot” coronal flux ropes—magnetic structures whose emission signatures indicate ∼10 MK plasma—are formed prior to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). By tracking extreme‐ultraviolet (EUV) signatures, white‐light CMEs in coronagraph data, full–Sun X‐ray lightcurves, and detailed photospheric magnetic field observations, the paper demonstrates that successive episodes of confined flares and photospheric orbiting motions in active regions lead to magnetic reconnection in the corona. These reconnection bursts transform sheared arcade fields into hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) configurations that eventually erupt as CMEs. The study uses a variety of instruments to track these processes over several events ranging from 13 March 2012 through 14 July 2017.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) is used to capture EUV images of the solar corona in multiple wavebands. In this study, it identifies hot plasma features (sigmoids and plasmoids) indicative of ∼10 MK conditions as well as cooler counterparts for comparison, and reveals EUV dimmings and flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Arcades can be identified in many of the EUV passbands of the SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012), but sigmoids and plasmoids appear only in those bands with the hottest temperature responses ∼10 MK. The 131 Å channel of AIA was used to identify sigmoids and plasmoids in the corona because it has a peak in temperature response at ∼107.0 K, however, it also has another peak at the lower temperature of 105.6 K (see Fig. 11 of Boerner et al. 2012)." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: 13 March 2012 Event
- **Time Range**: Observations of coronal evolution are noted around 16:30 UT to 16:47 UT on 13 March 2012.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "On 13 March 2012, a CME and accompanying M7.9 flare occurred in NOAA AR 11429 at ∼17:10 UT. An inverse-S (left-handed) sigmoid and underlying arcade brightened in the active region at 16:30 UT, shortly before the onset of the eruption... The centre of the pre-eruptive sigmoid (at 16:47 UT) is estimated to be at an altitude of 56 ± 5 Mm above the photosphere."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - 131 Å (sensitive to hot plasma ∼10 MK with an additional cooler contribution)
   - 171 Å (used for comparison to distinguish hot from cool plasma)
   - 193 Å and 211 Å (to identify EUV dimmings)
   - 1600 Å (to locate flare ribbons)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Additionally, observations from the 193 Å, and 211 Å channels of AIA (that image coronal plasma at ∼106.2 K and ∼106.3 K respectively) were used to identify EUV dimmings, and the 1600 Å channel (that images plasma in the lower solar atmosphere at ∼105.0 K) was used to locate flare ribbons."
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Coronal sigmoids and plasmoids (indicative of hot flux rope formation), EUV dimmings, and flare ribbon locations.
  
#### Data Collection Period 2: 13–14 June 2012 Events
- **Time Range**: 
   - For the 13 June 2012 CME, a key plasmoid feature is observed rising from around 11:30 UT with its underside estimated at 12:14 UT.
   - For the 14 June 2012 CME, images at 12:24 UT are used to estimate the sigmoid mid-point.
   - **Supporting Quotes**:
      - "On 13 June 2012 at 13:00 UT a CME erupted from NOAA AR 11504... A hot EUV plasma emission feature (plasmoid) started to develop around 11:30 UT and it then rose above the flare arcade... At 12:14 UT, the underside of the slowly-rising plasmoid is estimated to be at a height of 173 ± 26 Mm..."
      - "A sigmoid brightened in the active region above the arcade... The middle of the sigmoid is estimated to be at an altitude of 89 ± 30 Mm above the photosphere at 12:24 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Same as above (131 Å for sigmoids; 1600 Å for flare ribbons, etc.).
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Hot plasmoid and sigmoid signatures as indicators of flux rope formation.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - These periods capture the confined flare activity that is interpreted as successive reconnection events feeding the developing flux rope.

#### Data Collection Period 3: 8 October 2012 Event
- **Time Range**: 
   - Observations include a confined flare at 05:23 UT on 6 October that marks the onset of flux rope formation and extend to the CME eruption at approximately 20:30 UT on 8 October 2012.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Five confined flares occurred in the centre of NOAA AR 11585 ... This suggests the confined flares were involved in the formation of the flux rope that erupted on 8 October, and therefore they indicate the times at which the flux rope formed. In this way, formation started with a confined flare at 05:23 UT on 6 October."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å (for the inferred sigmoid), supported by images in other passbands for context.
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Expanding sigmoid structure and twin EUV dimmings that reveal the footpoints of the flux rope.

#### Data Collection Period 4: 14 July 2017 Event
- **Time Range**: 
   - Key observations in the hours preceding the CME include sigmoid brightenings starting several hours before the eruption, with the CME itself erupting at ∼01:00 UT on 14 July 2017.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "On 14 July 2017, a CME erupted from NOAA AR 12665 at ∼01:00 UT... The active region appeared faintly sigmoidal several hours before the eruption in the 131 Å channel of AIA."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Same set as above with primary emphasis on the 131 Å channel.
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Faint sigmoid structures evolving into a clear eruption signature and corresponding EUV dimmings and flare ribbons.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The series of confined flares observed in conjunction with the 131 Å signatures support the interpretation of gradual flux rope building.
