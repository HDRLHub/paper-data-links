## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the propagation and evolution of fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their associated shocks from the Sun to interplanetary space beyond 1 au. A set of seven CME events from solar cycle 23 is analyzed using coordinated observations from multiple instruments. White‐light images from the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs are used to capture CME morphology near the Sun, while radio type II burst measurements from Wind/WAVES track shock propagation in the interplanetary medium. In‐situ plasma and magnetic field measurements from spacecraft at L1 (Wind, ACE, and Genesis) and at larger distances (Ulysses) provide information on shock arrival and ICME properties. The study employs a Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to reconstruct CME geometry near the Sun and applies both an analytical model (with no free parameters) and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to quantify the shock kinematics. Altogether, these multi‐instrument observations link the CME near the Sun with signatures measured at Earth and at distances well beyond 1 au and enable a statistical analysis relevant for space weather forecasting.
