## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates a sunquake event in NOAA active region 11675 on 17 February 2013. The study employs a variety of observational data spanning multiple layers of the solar atmosphere (corona, chromosphere, and photosphere) with supporting modeling through a non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation. The principal data sources are direct observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) instruments—Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)—as well as supporting observations and event context from RHESSI, SOHO/LASCO, GOES, and STEREO/COR1. The research covers precise data collection periods surrounding the flaring and sunquake event, with particular emphasis on vector and line-of-sight magnetograms, continuum and dopplergrams, and multi-wavelength EUV and UV imaging. Data is processed over an 8-hour window including the pre-flare, flare, and sunquake onset phases, and forms the foundation for the temporal, spatial, and energetic analyses presented in the paper.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI data are central to the detection and analysis of the sunquake, the magnetic field structure of the active region, and the evolution of the photospheric magnetic environment leading up to and during the event.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Full disk Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations (Scherrer et al. 2012) are used to detect and investigate the sunquake that occurred on 17 February 2013 in NOAA active region 11675."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sunquake detection and analysis via dopplergrams and continuum images
- **Time Range**: 2013-02-17 11:59 UT – 2013-02-17 19:58 UT (Event: Sunquake in NOAA 11675; observation window spans pre- and post-flare phases)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "45 second cadence HMI data are selected over an 8-hour time window...The heliographic centre of the extracted region is 37E,12N at 11:59 UT on 17 February 2013, and the data series is extracted on 17 February 2013 from 11:59 UT to 19:58 UT."

- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity (sunquake detection), photospheric continuum intensity, and line-of-sight magnetic field
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The acoustic holography technique described in Zharkov et al. (2011, 2013) is used to create 'egression' power maps from the HMI velocity observations."
- **Additional Comments**: Egression power derived from frequency-filtered velocity data; applied remapping and rotation correction; intensity and magnetogram images used for co-location with seismic and magnetic features.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Vector and line-of-sight magnetic field evolution
- **Time Range**: 2013-02-15 to 2013-02-17, detailed for sunquake-day as 2013-02-17 11:00 UT – 16:00 UT (photospheric fragment motion); vector snapshot at 2013-02-17 14:36 UT (NLFFF boundary)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The HMI cylindrical equal area (CEA) vector data allow a study of the magnetic ﬁeld structure at the photosphere... The bald patches are relatively stable and persistent between 17 February 12:00 UT and 17 February 15:48 UT (the time when the C-class ﬂare emission peaks)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173 Å (magnetography)

  - **Supporting Quote**: "Data at a cadence of 45s (which have a noise level of 10.2 Gauss) and 720s (which have a noise level of 6.3 Gauss) are used (Liu et al. 2012). Both HMI datasets have a pixel size of 0.5′′."
- **Additional Comments**: Both LOS and vector data used for field topology and as the boundary condition for NLFFF extrapolation.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA multi-wavelength EUV and UV images are used to trace coronal and chromospheric evolution, flare ribbon morphology, and filament/eruption evolution closely tied to the active region and sunquake event.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In addition to HMI, data from SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (Lemen et al. 2012)... are also used."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Active region coronal and chromospheric structure, flare evolution, filament dynamics

  - **Supporting Quote**: "AIA images in the 304 Å, 171 Å and 335 Å wavebands showing the evolution of the corona above the sunquake origin."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The flare ribbons seen in the AIA 1700 Å channel (Figure 8) indicate that these flares were indeed two separate energy releases rather than a single event that exhibited a complex soft X-ray profile."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV/UV emission (coronal loops, filament, flare ribbons, eruption signatures)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The ribbons associated to the C-class flare exhibit a circular-shaped emission... The ribbons associated to the M-class flare, during which the emission appears over almost the entirety of the positive polarity fragment A3 and over the the polarity inversion line that exists between the positive polarity of polarity A3 and the negative polarity of Bipole B."
- **Additional Comments**: AIA imaging is directly compared with field extrapolation snapshots; aligns loop/ribbon/filament features with magnetic topology evolution and NLFFF modeling.
