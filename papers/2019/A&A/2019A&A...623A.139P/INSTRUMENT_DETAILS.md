## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a combined methodology that uses forward geometrical modelling and white‐light mass determination to derive the three-dimensional structure, kinematics, and mass of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study applies the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to CME observations obtained simultaneously from two different vantage points using the SECCHI/COR2 coronagraphs onboard the twin NASA STEREO spacecraft. The analysed CME events span a period from January 2007 to December 2013, allowing the authors to perform a detailed statistical investigation of CME morphological parameters, speeds, and mass estimates. A cross‐comparison is also made with observations from the SOHO/LASCO C3 coronagraph to help confirm the CME propagation direction and to assess issues such as projection and mass overestimation, especially for disk events.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SECCHI/COR2 Coronagraph on board the STEREO Spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument constitutes the primary observational tool used in the study. It obtains white‐light images of the solar corona via Thomson scattering of photospheric light by coronal electrons.
   - The SECCHI/COR2 telescopes provide images which are processed from Level−0.5 to Level−1.0 FITS, corrected for exposure, CCD bias, vignetting, flat‐field, and other optical distortions.
   - Its white‐light mass determination approach uses the brightness measured in mean solar brightness (MSB) units to estimate the total electron content and, hence, the CME mass.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "In this work, the white-light images of the SECCHI/COR2 coronagraphs are used for the geometrical modelling as well as for the CME mass determination."  
   (Sect. 2.1 and 2.2)
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Events Observation
- **Time Range**: January 2007 – December 2013  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "We model 122 CME events, which occurred between January 2007 and December 2013, using data from the SECCHI/COR2 coronagraphs."  
     (Sect. 2.1)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light as a result of Thomson scattering of photospheric light)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "CMEs are optically thin structures because the observed brightness arises from the Thompson scattering of the photospheric lights from the entrained electrons."  
     (Introduction)
- **Physical Observable**: CME white-light brightness (converted to mass images in units of grams per pixel)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "Then a suitable pre-event image... is subtracted from the CME images... We then apply Thomson scattering theory to Level−1.0 FITS images to create so called 'mass images'."  
     (Sect. 2.2)
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - These observations cover the corona from about 2.5 to 15 R⊙ with a typical cadence of 15 minutes, making it possible to derive an apex speed at a reference height (12 R⊙) for the CMEs.
   - The measured data are used both for the geometrical positioning via the GCS model and the subsequent mass determination.

### 2. SOHO/LASCO C3 Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - The SOHO/LASCO C3 coronagraph is used in this study as a complementary instrument to confirm the CME propagation direction and to compare mass estimations derived from SECCHI/COR2 images. It provides a near perpendicular view relative to the SECCHI perspectives.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "Images from the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs, positioned along the Sun-Earth line, are used to confirm the direction of the CME if it is seen as halo in both STEREO satellites."  
   (Sect. 2.2, paragraph referencing LASCO)
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Comparative Confirmation During Specific Events
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified as a continuous observation period, but used during events such as the CME on September 22, 2011 and in other cases to support the SECCHI/COR2 measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "The C3 images... suggest that a northern pre-existing streamer increases in brightness and is deflected towards the POS of COR2 coronagraphs..."  
     (Sect. 3.3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (observations of the corona via scattered photospheric light)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "...the LASCO C3 coronagraph... produces white-light images similar to the SECCHI/COR2 but from a different viewing angle."  
     (Sect. 3.3)
- **Physical Observable**: White-light brightness that enables the estimation of CME mass and the assessment of projection effects when compared to SECCHI measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "For comparison—from the LASCO perspective, the northern streamer is largely outside of the ROI used in the mass calculation..."  
     (Sect. 3.3)
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - Although SOHO/LASCO C3 is not the primary instrument for mass determination in this study, its data are critical for cross-validation, particularly in cases where projection effects may lead to overestimation of the CME mass in SECCHI/COR2 images.
