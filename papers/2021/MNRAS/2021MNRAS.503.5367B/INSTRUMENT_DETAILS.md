## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper presents a multi-frequency observational campaign of the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, which became active following a bright radio burst coincident with an X‐ray flare. The study combines simultaneous and non‐simultaneous observations from a variety of telescopes spanning radio and optical wavelengths. In the radio domain, high-time resolution data were acquired using instruments such as Arecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT (in both imaging and beamformed modes), the Northern Cross, and the MK2 telescope. Additionally, MeerLICHT, an optical imager, provided deep optical imaging to search for any persistent or transient counterparts. The campaign’s multi-epoch observations, covering dates from late April to mid-June 2020, probe a range of frequencies (from approximately 120 MHz to above 6000 MHz) and physical observables (such as single pulse detections, continuum imaging, and dispersion measures) to better understand the emission mechanisms of the magnetar and constrain its distance.
