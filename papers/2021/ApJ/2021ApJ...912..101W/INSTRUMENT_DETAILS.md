## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the dependence of solar wind proton temperature on the polarization properties of Alfvénic fluctuations at ion-kinetic scales. Using nearly 15 years of in situ Wind spacecraft observations, the study examines how magnetic helicity signatures — separated into contributions from fluctuations with wave-vectors quasi-parallel and oblique to the local mean magnetic field, B₀ — correlate with proton temperature anisotropy. The paper employs measurements of the magnetic field and proton velocity distribution functions to study kinetic interactions in the solar wind plasma and differentiates between heating mechanisms associated with right-handed kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) and left-handed Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. MFI Fluxgate Magnetometer on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument provides vector magnetic field measurements used to compute magnetic helicity and wave polarization parameters. It is key to resolving the properties of the magnetic fluctuations at ion-kinetic scales.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “We analyse magnetic ﬁeld data from the MFI ﬂuxgate magnetometer (Lepping et al. 1995; Koval & Szabo 2013) ... on-board the Wind spacecraft from Jun 2004 to Oct 2018.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Wind Observations (Magnetic Field)
- **Time Range**: June 2004 – October 2018  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “... instruments on-board the Wind spacecraft from Jun 2004 to Oct 2018.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Not applicable; however, the instrument measures fluctuations corresponding to ion-kinetic scales (e.g., frequencies near the Taylor-shifted scales vsw/dp and vsw/ρp).  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “... we estimate the amplitudes of σxy and σyz at ion-kinetic scales by ﬁtting a Gaussian function to the coherent peak in each spectrum at frequencies close to the Taylor-shifted frequencies, vsw/dp and vsw/ρp (see Woodham et al. 2018).”
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Magnetic field vectors and derived properties such as magnetic helicity, polarization parameters (e.g., σₘ and Re(P)) and anisotropy relative to the local mean field B₀.  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “Single-spacecraft observations have an inherent spatio-temporal ambiguity ... these measurements are restricted to the sampling of a time series defined by the trajectory of the spacecraft...”
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The high time resolution (11 Hz measurements in segments corresponding to the proton integration time) allows for resolving fluctuations over time scales of ~92 s, essential for studying turbulence at ion-kinetic scales.

### 2. SWE Faraday Cup on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument measures the proton velocity distribution functions (VDFs) using a Faraday cup design, enabling the calculation of proton thermal speeds and temperatures (both perpendicular and parallel to the local mean magnetic field). These measurements are critical for interpreting the effects of wave-particle interactions and turbulent heating processes.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “... and proton data from the SWE Faraday cup (Ogilvie et al. 1995; Kasper et al. 2006) instruments on-board the Wind spacecraft from Jun 2004 to Oct 2018.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Wind Observations (Proton Measurements)
- **Time Range**: June 2004 – October 2018  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “... on-board the Wind spacecraft from Jun 2004 to Oct 2018.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Not applicable; the SWE Faraday Cup does not measure wavelengths but samples the energy distribution of protons through different voltage (energy) windows.  
  - **Additional Context**:  
    In this context, the instrument quantifies physical observables in the plasma (e.g., proton thermal speeds and derived temperatures) rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Proton velocity distribution functions, proton thermal speeds (wp,∥ and wp,⊥), and derived temperatures (Tp,∥ and Tp,⊥). These parameters are critical for determining temperature anisotropy and understanding kinetic heating processes.  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “By ﬁtting a bi-Maxwellian to the reduced proton VDF, the proton thermal speeds, wp,∥ and wp,⊥, are obtained and converted to temperatures via Tp,⊥/∥ = mₚ wp,⊥/∥²/2kB …”
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The SWE Faraday Cup collects a full proton spectrum every ~92 seconds by cycling through different energy windows as the spacecraft spins (approximately every 3 s). This measurement cadence is synchronized with the MFI observations to provide an integrated picture of both magnetic fluctuations and proton kinetic properties throughout the study period.
