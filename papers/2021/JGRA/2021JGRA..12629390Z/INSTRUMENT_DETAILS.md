## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents in situ observations of a multiscale, multi‐type magnetopause reconnection event on 11 September 2015 using data from NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and complementary solar wind measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The study distinguishes between cold (10–500 eV) and hot (500–30000 eV) ion populations and reveals that a secondary reconnection—termed the electron–cold ion current sheet—operates at the edge of an ion‐scale reconnection. The instruments recorded detailed magnetic field, electric field, and plasma parameters, with high temporal resolution during key intervals (e.g. ~07:55:27–07:55:40 UT for the ion‐scale event, and the sub‐second structure observed near ~07:55:30.4 UT and ~07:55:33.4 UT for the electron–cold ion current sheet). These observation periods and the associated physical observables (i.e. magnetic field reversals, plasma flows, energy conversion rates) are integral to interpreting the role of low‐energy ions in reconnection and to understanding the coexistence of antiparallel and component reconnection geometries.
