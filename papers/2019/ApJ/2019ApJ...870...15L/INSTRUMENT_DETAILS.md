## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines large-scale extreme‐ultraviolet (EUV) wavefronts accompanying a series of homologous coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from active region NOAA 12371 in June 2015. The authors analyze the initiation, propagation, and interaction of the primary EUV wavefront with various coronal structures – including polar and equatorial coronal holes, quiescent filaments, and a coronal arcade – using multi-wavelength imaging and complementary high-energy and magnetic field observations. The study makes extensive use of data from different space-borne instruments, each operating in distinct wavelength bands or energy domains, and spanning different observational time intervals during the flare/CME events. These instruments jointly help reveal the dynamics of wave initiation, propagation speed deceleration, plasma heating signatures (in e.g., 211 Å images versus dimming in 193 and 171 Å images), and the associated hard X-ray (HXR) and white-light signatures of the eruptions.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO

   - EIT is mentioned as part of the historical progression of space-borne EUV telescopes. It provided early full-disk EUV imaging and is one of the three generations referenced in the introduction.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...owing mostly to three generations of space-borne telescopes with ever increasing spatiotemporal resolution in EUV, namely, the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995)...”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
   - **Additional Comments**: EIT is referenced for context and historical comparison rather than direct data used in the study.

### 2. Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI is introduced as another generation of EUV imaging with improved spatiotemporal resolution. It is mentioned alongside EIT and AIA as an important predecessor.

### 3. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is the principal instrument used in the study. It provides full-disk EUV images with a spatial scale of 0.6 arcsec pixel⁻¹ and a cadence of 12 s. The study focuses on four passbands (131 Å, 211 Å, 193 Å, and 171 Å) that are key to detecting hot eruptive structures and EUV wavefronts.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In the investigations below we mainly used the EUV imaging data obtained by AIA. The instrument takes full-disk images with a spatial scale of 0.6 arcsec pixel⁻¹ and a cadence of 12 s. Among the 7 EUV and 2 UV passbands, we focused on four of them: 131 Å (primarily Fe XXI for flare plasma, with a peak response temperature log T = 7.05; Fe VIII for ARs, log T = 5.6), 211 Å (Fe XIV, log T = 6.3), 193 Å (Fe XXIV for flare plasma, log T = 7.25; Fe XII for ARs, log T = 6.2) and 171 Å (Fe IX, log T = 5.8).”

### 5. Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - GBM, which also observes hard X-rays/gamma-rays, provided supplementary HXR lightcurves for the flare events.
- **Supporting Quote**:

   - “The CMEs were observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Specific time markers are not detailed in the text; however, LASCO images (particularly from the C2 camera as shown in Figure 1) correspond to the CMEs associated with the three events on 2015 June 21, 22, and 25.
   - **Additional Comments**: The exact UT start and end of the LASCO observations are not provided but are understood to coincide with the evolution of the halo CMEs following the corresponding flare events.

### 7. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
