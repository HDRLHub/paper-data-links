## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates a solar energetic particle (SEP) event observed on October 9, 2021, which involved multiple spacecraft including Solar Orbiter (SolO). The event was associated with an M1.6 flare, a coronal mass ejection (CME), and a shock wave. During the event, high-energy protons and electrons were recorded by multiple instruments located within a narrow longitudinal cone. The study aimed to investigate and identify the multiple sources of energetic electron acceleration, focusing on the multi-stage particle energization during the flare impulsive phase and a separate phase of electron acceleration detected at SolO after the flare maximum. The paper utilized SEP electron observations from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) and hard X-ray (HXR) observations from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board SolO, combined with radio observations across a broad frequency range. The results indicated that the flare was able to accelerate electrons for at least 20 minutes during the nonthermal phase observed in the form of five discrete HXR pulses, and the shock wave contributed to the electron acceleration during and after the impulsive flare phase.
