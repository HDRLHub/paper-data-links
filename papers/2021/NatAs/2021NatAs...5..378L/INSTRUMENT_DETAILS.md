## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports the detection and identification of a non-thermal, double‐peaked X‐ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154—one that is found to be associated with the fast radio burst FRB 200428. The core observations were made with China’s Insight-HXMT satellite during a dedicated Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation. Insight-HXMT’s three collimated telescopes simultaneously cover different X-ray energy bands (low, medium, and high) and provided detailed timing (down to millisecond resolution) and spectral information in the 1–250 keV range. Complementary observations from radio instruments such as CHIME/FRB and STARE26 (which detected FRB 200428 at radio frequencies of 600 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively), as well as triggers from INTEGRAL, Fermi/GBM, and Konus-Wind, are used to support the identification of this unique explosive event. Several time intervals are mentioned: the overall ToO observation spanned from April 28, 07:14:52 UT to April 29, 11:53:01 UT, and the burst under detailed analysis is centered at T0 = 2020-04-28 14:34:24 UT with selected “good time intervals” (GTIs) around the burst (e.g. from T0–0.2 s to T0+1 s).
