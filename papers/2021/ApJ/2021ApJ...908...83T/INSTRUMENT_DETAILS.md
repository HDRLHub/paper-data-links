1. Konus‐Wind (KW) Gamma‐Ray Spectrometer on board the Wind spacecraft  
   - General Comments:  
     - KW is a gamma‐ray spectrometer that operates in two modes, with this study focusing on its “waiting mode” detections.  
     - It plays a central role in the catalog by providing broadband spectral data that enable direct estimation of GRB peak energies, broadband energy fluences, and peak fluxes.  
     - The instrument’s wide spectral band gives it the advantage in constraining spectral parameters with fewer extrapolations.  
   - Detector and Wavelength Details:  
     - KW is equipped with two identical omnidirectional NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors.  
     - In waiting mode, the effective energy band used in the analysis covers approximately 20 keV up to about 1.5 MeV (with slight variations between detectors S1 and S2).  
   - Physical Observables:  
     - The instrument measures temporal and spectral characteristics of GRBs; key observables include the GRB peak spectral energy (Eₚ), broadband energy fluence (S), and peak flux (Fₚ).  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - The catalog specifically comprises GRBs detected in KW’s waiting mode during the period from January 2005 to December 2018.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “Here, we present a sample of 167 GRBs with reliably measured redshifts detected by KW in the waiting mode and, simultaneously, observed by Swift/BAT, from the beginning of the Swift era in 2004 to the end of 2018.”  

2. Swift/BAT (Burst Alert Telescope) on board the Swift spacecraft  
   - General Comments:  
     - BAT is a highly sensitive, large field of view coded-aperture telescope designed for real-time detection and localization of GRBs.  
     - It enables rapid follow-up observations (by subsequent onboard instruments such as XRT and UVOT) through precise localization of the GRB event.  
     - For this study, BAT provided critical light curves and spectral data that were jointly analyzed with KW measurements.  
   - Detector and Wavelength Details:  
     - BAT’s detector plane comprises 32,768 CdZnTe (CZT) detectors paired with a coded-aperture mask constructed from roughly 52,000 lead tiles.  
     - Its primary energy range for imaging is approximately 15–150 keV, while spectral information can be extracted up to about 350 keV.  
   - Physical Observables:  
     - BAT delivers precise GRB localizations and detailed light curves. In the analysis, BAT data (e.g., in the 25–350 keV band) were used for constructing light curves (via Bayesian block decomposition) and for spectral fits, contributing to the measurement of fluxes and spectral parameters.  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - Although the Swift mission has been operational since November 2004, the data used in this joint analysis with KW cover the period from January 2005 to December 2018.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “The Swift mission, dedicated to GRB studies, was launched on 2004 November… When the BAT detects a GRB, Swift slews to the GRB position…” and “...observed by Swift/BAT, from 2005 January to 2018 December.”
