This script uses SunPy's VSO interface (via Fido) to query solar observational data.
We perform two separate queries based on the context:

1. SOHO Coronagraph Data for the 2017 July event:
   - Time Range: Around 2017-07-23T05:09 UT (we use a 20‚Äêminute window from 05:00 to 05:20 UT).
   - Instrument: SOHO (typically provides coronagraph imagery in white light).

2. STEREO A Remote-Sensing Data for the 2012 July event:
   - Time Range: From approximately 2012-07-23T02:20:00 (eruption onset) to 2012-07-23T20:55:00 (shock arrival).
   - Instrument: STEREO A.

Note: This script queries the VSO but the actual data fetching (Fido.fetch) is commented out.
