## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the spatial extent and implications of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) abundances in solar energetic particles (SEPs). It differentiates between "gradual" SEP events, driven by shock waves from coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and "impulsive" SEP events, associated with magnetic reconnection in solar jets. The study uses data from various instruments to analyze element abundances, ionization states, and source temperatures of SEPs. The findings highlight the importance of shock waves in spreading SEPs across the Sun and the role of different seed populations in determining the observed abundances of elements like H and He.
