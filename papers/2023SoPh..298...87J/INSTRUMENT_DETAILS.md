## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper introduces a novel deep learning approach, named MagNet, for generating photospheric vector magnetograms of solar active regions using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), and Hα observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The study aims to extend the availability of vector magnetograms back to the period covering solar cycle 23 (1996-2010), a time when only line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms were consistently available from SOHO/MDI. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the MagNet model in generating vector components \(B'_x\) and \(B'_y\) from combined LOS magnetograms and Hα observations, thus providing a valuable tool for analyzing and forecasting solar eruptive events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) for a period that previously lacked such detailed magnetic field data.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is instrumental in providing continuous coverage of full disk Doppler velocities, LOS magnetograms, and continuum proxy images with a spatial resolution of 1" and observes the full solar disk at 6173 Å every 12 minutes. It has been operational since May 1, 2010, covering solar cycle 24.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Training and Testing for MagNet Model
- **Time Range**: May 1, 2010 – December 31, 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: 6173 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Full disk Doppler velocities, LOS magnetograms, and continuum proxy images.
- **Additional Comments**: Photospheric vector magnetograms have been available since the launch of SDO/HMI, providing crucial data for the MagNet model training and testing.

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI was a major instrument for acquiring full disk LOS magnetograms every 96 minutes with a spatial resolution of 4" on a 1024 × 1024 detector, covering the period from 1996 to 2011, which includes the more active solar cycle 23.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping Data Collection with HMI
- **Time Range**: May 1, 2010 – April 11, 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Full disk LOS magnetograms.
- **Additional Comments**: The overlapping period of MDI and HMI data collection is used for validating the MagNet model's performance in generating vector magnetograms.

### Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - BBSO has provided ground-based full disk Hα observations since the 1970s, with observations taken every 1 minute for up to 9 hours on an observing day at the wavelength of 6563 Å. The spatial resolution is 2".

#### Data Collection Period 1: Selection for MagNet Model Training and Testing
- **Time Range**: May 1, 2010 – December 31, 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: 6563 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Full disk Hα observations.
- **Additional Comments**: The selection of Hα images for the MagNet model training and testing was based on criteria ensuring image completeness and clarity, focusing on the period overlapping with HMI and MDI data availability.
