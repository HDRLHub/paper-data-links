## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the influence of surface differential rotation on the angular momentum-loss rate of the Sun, particularly in the context of magnetized stellar winds. It utilizes magnetohydrodynamic models and data from ADAPT-GONG magnetograms spanning one solar activity cycle (2007–2022) to quantify the effects of differential rotation on the solar wind-braking torque. The findings indicate that during solar minima, the rotation rate of the corona decreases compared to the solid-body rotation rate, while during solar maximum, the rotation rate approaches that of the Carrington rotation. The study emphasizes the need for further research into the role of differential rotation in other Sun-like stars.

## Instrumentation Details

### ADAPT-GONG Magnetograms
- **General Comments**:
   - The ADAPT-GONG magnetograms are crucial for modeling the solar magnetic field and understanding the rotation rates of the solar wind. They provide the necessary data to evaluate the effective rotation rate of the coronal magnetic field.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetograms spanning solar activity cycle
- **Time Range**: January 2007 – February 2022
   - **Supporting Quote**: "magnetograms spanning one solar activity cycle (2007–2022)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified, but the data is derived from magnetic field observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The ADAPT-GONG magnetograms leverage the underlying flux transport model..."
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength and configuration at the solar surface.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The use of PFSS models to infer the source locations of the solar wind... has become widespread due to the efficiency and simplicity of the model."
- **Additional Comments**: The magnetograms are produced using a combination of data assimilation and forward modeling, accounting for various solar dynamics.

### Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) Model
- **General Comments**:
   - The PFSS model is employed to extrapolate the solar magnetic field into the corona, allowing for the assessment of the rotation rates of the solar wind based on the surface magnetic field data.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Modeling the solar magnetic field
- **Time Range**: Data derived from the same period as the ADAPT-GONG magnetograms (January 2007 – February 2022).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The PFSS model is driven by spherical harmonic decomposition of the ADAPT-GONG magnetograms."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable, as this is a modeling technique rather than an observational instrument.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The PFSS magnetic field is constructed based on the following equations..."
- **Physical Observable**: The configuration of the solar magnetic field and its influence on solar wind dynamics.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "This study makes a simplified assessment of the impact of differential rotation at the base of the solar wind..."
- **Additional Comments**: The PFSS model is used to calculate the effective rotation rate of the wind based on the magnetic field configuration.

### Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) - LASCO
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft is utilized for observing coronal structures in white light, which helps in understanding the rotation of the corona and the dynamics of solar wind.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of coronal streamers
- **Time Range**: 2008 – 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "most recently, Edwards et al. (2022), following the methodology of Morgan (2011), who measured the rotation rate of long-lived streamer structures in LASCO C2 white light images from 2008–2020."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (scattered light from the corona).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The presence of white light streamers is essential for inferring coronal rotation..."
- **Physical Observable**: Apparent motion of coronal streamers and their rotation rates.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "From Fig. 8 it is clear that streamers typically appear at latitudes with faster rotation rates."
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from LASCO are critical for understanding the latitudinal variation of coronal rotation and its implications for solar wind dynamics.
