produce the script. We need to construct queries for the specified instruments and their respective time ranges. The instruments mentioned in the context are:

1. **SDO/AIA**: For observing solar activity phenomena.
2. **SOHO/LASCO**: For observing CMEs.
3. **STEREO/SECCHI**: For observing CMEs and CME-driven shocks.
4. **GOES**: For observing solar flares.

We will use the `Fido` module from `sunpy.net` to query the VSO for data from these instruments. The time ranges for some instruments are not specified in the context, so we will use the full available time range for those instruments.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import astropy.units as u
from sunpy.net import Fido
from sunpy.net import attrs as a

# Define the time ranges for the queries
time_range_messenger = a.Time('2010-02-07', '2015-04-30')

# Query for SDO/AIA data
print("Querying SDO/AIA data...")
query_sdo_aia = Fido.search(
    time_range_messenger,
    a.Instrument('AIA'),
    a.Source('SDO')
)
print(query_sdo_aia)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_sdo_aia = Fido.fetch(query_sdo_aia)

# Query for SOHO/LASCO data
print("Querying SOHO/LASCO data...")
query_soho_lasco = Fido.search(
    time_range_messenger,
    a.Instrument('LASCO'),
    a.Source('SOHO')
)
print(query_soho_lasco)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_soho_lasco = Fido.fetch(query_soho_lasco)

# Query for STEREO/SECCHI data
print("Querying STEREO/SECCHI data...")
query_stereo_secchi = Fido.search(
    time_range_messenger,
    a.Instrument('SECCHI'),
    a.Source('STEREO')
)
print(query_stereo_secchi)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_stereo_secchi = Fido.fetch(query_stereo_secchi)

# Query for GOES data
print("Querying GOES data...")
query_goes = Fido.search(
    time_range_messenger,
    a.Instrument('XRS'),
    a.Source('GOES')
)
print(query_goes)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_goes = Fido.fetch(query_goes)
```

This script queries the VSO for data from the specified instruments within the given time range. The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out to prevent automatic downloading of the data. You can uncomment these lines to fetch the data if needed. The script is explicit and well-commented, reflecting the data used in the context provided.
