## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates a gradual eruption of a large, quiescent solar filament on 2018 August 20 that evolved into a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) and ultimately produced an intense geomagnetic storm observed at Earth on August 25–26. The study makes extensive use of remote-sensing observations and in situ measurements. EUV images, magnetograms, and soft X‐ray data from space-based instruments onboard SDO (AIA and HMI) and GOES are used to characterize the filament eruption and low-corona magnetic configuration. Coronagraph data from SOHO (C2/LASCO) and STEREO A (COR2, HI1, HI2) provide views of the CME evolution and propagation in interplanetary space, while in situ measurements from Wind reveal the CME’s magnetic cloud structure at 1 AU. Additionally, ground-based synoptic magnetograms from GONG are employed to map the coronal magnetic field configuration and the heliospheric current sheet. The various time ranges—from early EUV imaging at 04:00 UT on August 20 to the in situ flux rope observations from 14:10 UT on August 25 to 09:09 UT on August 26—are integral to reconstructing the CME’s evolution and understanding the mechanisms that led to the strong geomagnetic impact.
