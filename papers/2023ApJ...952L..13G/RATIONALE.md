**produce the script**. We need to construct queries for the LASCO, AIA, and SECCHI instruments based on the provided context. The queries will focus on the time ranges and physical observables relevant to the study of halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs) during the rise phases of solar cycles 23, 24, and 25. We will ensure that the queries are specific to the instruments and the data types mentioned in the context.

**Script**:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# LASCO on SOHO: Observations of HCMEs during the rise phases of solar cycles 23, 24, and 25
lasco_time_range = a.Time('1996-01-01T00:00:00', '2022-12-31T23:59:59')
lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")
lasco_query = Fido.search(lasco_time_range, lasco_instrument)

# AIA on SDO: Identification of solar sources for HCMEs in solar cycles 24 and 25
# Assuming the rise phase of solar cycle 24 started in 2008 and ended in 2014 for cycle 25
aia_time_range = a.Time('2008-01-01T00:00:00', '2022-12-31T23:59:59')
aia_instrument = a.Instrument("AIA")
aia_wavelength = a.Wavelength(171 * u.angstrom, 304 * u.angstrom)  # Typical EUV wavelengths
aia_query = Fido.search(aia_time_range, aia_instrument, aia_wavelength)

# SECCHI on STEREO: Confirmation of backside halo locations in solar cycles 24 and 25
secchi_time_range = a.Time('2008-01-01T00:00:00', '2022-12-31T23:59:59')
secchi_instrument = a.Instrument("SECCHI")
secchi_query = Fido.search(secchi_time_range, secchi_instrument)

# Display the query results
print("Query for LASCO data:")
print(lasco_query)
print("Query for AIA data:")
print(aia_query)
print("Query for SECCHI data:")
print(secchi_query)

# Uncomment the lines below to download the data
# lasco_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_query)
# aia_files = Fido.fetch(aia_query)
# secchi_files = Fido.fetch(secchi_query)
```

**Explanation**:
1. **LASCO Query**: We set the time range from 1996 to the end of 2022 to cover the rise phases of solar cycles 23, 24, and 25 as mentioned in the context. The instrument specified is LASCO, which is used to observe HCMEs.

2. **AIA Query**: The time range is set from 2008 to 2022, covering the rise phases of solar cycles 24 and 25. We use AIA on SDO to identify solar sources associated with HCMEs, focusing on typical EUV wavelengths.

3. **SECCHI Query**: Similar to the AIA query, the time range covers the rise phases of solar cycles 24 and 25. SECCHI on STEREO is used to confirm the locations of backside halos, enhancing our understanding of HCMEs originating from areas not visible from the Earth-Sun line.

This script is designed to be clear and specific, adhering to the context provided and focusing on the required data types and instruments.
