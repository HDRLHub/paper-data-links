## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the cosmological evolution of the formation rate of short gamma‐ray bursts (SGRBs), including those with extended emission (SEE). The authors use non-parametric methods (combined EP-L) to analyze a carefully selected sample of SGRBs observed primarily by the Swift satellite, in order to determine intrinsic distributions such as the luminosity function and rate evolution. The analysis is based on a “complete” or “reliable” sample defined by well‐characterized flux thresholds, with observations spanning from December 2005 until June 2019. The Swift data in the 15–150 keV energy range, which include prompt emission measurements (flux, luminosity, T90) and follow-up observations in X-ray and optical/UV bands, form the backbone of the study. In addition, the paper mentions future prospects of including data from instruments like Konus-Wind and Fermi-GBM to refine the analyses.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Swift BAT on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is the primary data source for the study, enabling rapid follow-up observations across X-ray, optical, and UV wavelengths after the initial detection of the gamma-ray prompt emission. It has provided the most comprehensive sample of SGRBs+SEEs used in this paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift; Gehrels et al. (2004)) allows the rapid follow up (X-ray, optical/UV) observation after detection of the prompt emission.”
  
#### Data Collection Period: December 2005 – June 2019
- **Time Range**: December 2005 – June 2019  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...it is the most comprehensive sample in the literature from December 2005 until June 2019.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 15–150 keV  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...energy ﬂuxes, and hence luminosities, integrated over the Swift energy band 15–150 keV.”
- **Physical Observable**: Gamma-ray prompt emission characterized by peak energy flux (in erg cm⁻² s⁻¹), spectral features, and T90 duration measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For GRBs, one also requires redshift to obtain the luminosity and its truncation … Using energy ﬂuxes … integrated over the Swift energy band 15–150 keV.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The study defines flux limits (e.g., log ﬂim = −6.25, −6.34, −6.67 erg cm⁻² s⁻¹) derived from the Swift BAT observations, which are critical for sample selection and subsequent non-parametric analysis methods.
   - The instrument’s triggering criteria and detection thresholds, as discussed in the context, are key to correcting for observational biases in the derivation of the luminosity function and formation rate evolution.

### 2. Konus-Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - Konus-Wind is mentioned as one of the future data sources that may be combined with Swift observations to further constrain the GRB luminosity function and rate evolution.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...it may be possible to constrain the parameters of the delayed SFR models via the inclusion of GRBs observed by other instruments such as Konus-Wind and Fermi-GBM.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - No specific time range is provided for Konus-Wind in the current paper.
   - **Additional Comments**: Detailed detector properties, wavelength range, and observational parameters for Konus-Wind are not provided in the context.

### 3. Fermi-GBM
- **General Comments**:
   - Fermi-GBM is also indicated as a potential future source of GRB data which, when combined with the Swift BAT sample, can improve the statistical power and coverage for studies of SGRB formation rate and evolution.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...GRBs observed by other instruments such as Konus-Wind and Fermi-GBM.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - No specific observational time range is given for Fermi-GBM in this paper.
   - **Additional Comments**: The paper does not detail the wavelength coverage or specific detector details for Fermi-GBM in the current analysis.
