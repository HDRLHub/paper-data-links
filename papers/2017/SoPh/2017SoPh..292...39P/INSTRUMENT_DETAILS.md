## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
This paper develops and demonstrates a remote-sensing methodology to determine the intrinsic magnetic flux rope type of two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using direct observations of their solar disk source regions and coronal signatures. The two CME case studies (event dates: 2 June 2011 and 14 June 2012) are selected based on their clear associations between solar eruptions and in situ interplanetary flux rope observations. The authors use data from multiple, explicitly cited instruments for both remote-sensing (solar disk and corona imaging in EUV, soft X-ray, and Hα, photospheric magnetic field observations) and in situ solar wind plasma/magnetic field measurements. Time periods of data use are specified, and instrument capabilities (including wavelengths and cadence) are mentioned in support of methods such as proxy determination of magnetic helicity, polarity inversion line orientation, and footpoint anchoring. The results require multi-instrument usage for both the remote and in situ signatures, all directly underpinning the study’s conclusions about flux rope structure and space-weather-relevant forecasting potential.

- **Time Range**: 2011-05-31 to 2011-06-03, with CME main activity on 2011-06-02  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The evolution of the photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld of the two active regions is shown in Figure 1, top row, from 31 May to 3 June."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å, 131 Å, 1600 Å  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In addition to being visible in Hα, the ﬁlament was also visible in the EUV 171 ˚A waveband (Figure 1, third row)..."
    "In order to conﬁrm the axial ﬁeld prediction, we look at base-diﬀerence images at the EUV wavelength 131 ˚A (Figure 2, right panel)..."
    "As seen in Hα (Figure 1, second row) and UV 1600 ˚A (not shown) observations, both eruptions were associated with ﬂare ribbons."
- **Physical Observable**: coronal sigmoids, arcades, filaments (emission/absorption threads and eruption), coronal dimmings/footpoints, flare ribbons  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Soft X-ray observations (Figure 1, bottom row) show a particularly strong emission coming from AR 11226 and from a few loops connecting AR 11227 and AR 11226. The connecting loops formed initially a double J-shaped structure (Figure 1m) that evolved later on 2 June into a continuous sigmoid (Figure 1n)."
    "Observations of the coronal arcades from both soft X-rays and EUV 171 ˚A (Figures 1i, j, and n) show that, when viewed from the positive polarity side, the arcade above the PIL or ﬁlament channel was skewed to the right, implying the presence of a right-skewed arcade."
    "In order to conﬁrm the axial ﬁeld prediction, we look at base-diﬀerence images at the EUV wavelength 131 ˚A (Figure 2, right panel). As seen from the EUV dimmings, the western footpoint is rooted in the negative polarity region, and the eastern footpoint in the positive one."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Used for both pre-eruption and post-eruption imaging, including difference images to demonstrate coronal changes during and after CME launch.

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Therefore, in order to support the X-ray observations we observe the sigmoid also at the EUV 131 ˚A waveband. Figure 4, bottom row, shows the evolution of the erupting structure at 131 ˚A, that follows closely the soft X-ray emission."
- **Physical Observable**: sigmoid structure, sheared arcade, coronal dimmings/footpoints  
  - **Supporting Quote**:

- **Physical Observable**: line-of-sight magnetograms, magnetic tongues, PIL orientation  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "This active region appeared to be in its early stages based on the presence of new ﬂux emergence, which means that magnetic tongues (if present) can be used as a proxy for chirality. Magnetic tongues were visible around 12 June at 18:00 UT."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Directly used to overlay with EUV and X-ray imaging and to specify locations of CME footpoints.

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The connecting loops formed initially a double J-shaped structure (Figure 1m) that evolved later on 2 June into a continuous sigmoid (Figure 1n). The forward S-shape of the sigmoid is a sign of positive chirality."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Used to support and confirm EUV-imaged coronal morphologies and provide high temperature emission context.

    "This is visible in Figure 1e, where the Hα ﬁgure has been overlaid with magnetogram contours."
    "The eastern leg of the U-shaped structure started to erupt at around 06:25 UT (Eruption 1), and by around 06:50 UT the ﬁlament had partially reformed. Eruption 2 began around 07:15 UT, and by 08:00 UT the ﬁlament had completely disappeared."
    "However, the filament was thin and relatively short and hence we could not estimate the chirality using the characteristics of its barbs or legs and fibrils."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - GONG allows almost continuous solar coverage, providing key support for filament association with the observed CME.

- **Wavelength(s)**: 6563 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Absence of a filament in the source region  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Hα observations show that for this event no filament material was present at the PIL location."

- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Used for all in situ comparisons and cross-checks against remote predictions.
