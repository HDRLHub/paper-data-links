## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the evolution of the Alfvén Mach number (MA) associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock that was observed during a C7.7 class solar flare on 2017 September 2. To accomplish this, the authors compare three established methods—shock geometry from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, the ratio of CME speed to a data‐driven coronal Alfvén speed model, and the measurement of band-splitting in type II radio bursts. The key observational assets include EUV images from a Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board GOES-16, white-light images from the LASCO C2 coronagraph on board SOHO, and radio dynamic spectra from several radio instruments (WIND/WAVES, I-LOFAR, and ORFÉES). The study focuses on specific time intervals where the CME and its driven shock could be reliably tracked (for example, from approximately 15:32:56 UT to 15:40:56 UT for imaging) and relates the onset (~15:36–15:37 UT) and cessation (~15:48 UT) of type II radio emission to changes in shock geometry and strength.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board GOES-16
- **General Comments**:
   - SUVI is an EUV imaging instrument that provides observations of the solar atmosphere. In this study, it captures the evolution of the CME and its associated shock in extreme ultraviolet light.
   - It images in specific wavelength channels to highlight features such as the compressed plasma (shock sheath) and the dark driver (CME) front.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...observed at EUV wavelengths by GOES Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI; Seaton & Darnel 2018)...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME and Shock Imaging**
   - **Time Range**: 15:32:56 UT to 15:40:56 UT (on 2017 September 2)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The standoff distance and radius of curvature of the CME were evaluated for nine instances from 15:32:56 to 15:40:56 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Base difference images of the CME observed with SUVI 195 Å…”
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV brightness variations outlining both the shock sheath (intensity enhancement) and the CME front (darker circular feature), used to derive the geometry (standoff distance) and kinematics.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “In Figure 2, the brighter region is interpreted as the coronal plasma compressed by the transit of the shock wave driven by the CME…”
   - **Additional Comments**: These EUV observations are crucial for determining the shock’s geometry via the standoff distance method, enabling derivation of MA as the CME propagates from ∼1.2 to 1.9 R⊙.

### 2. LASCO C2 on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO C2 is a white-light coronagraph that images the corona by blocking out the bright solar disk. It is used here to track the CME propagation and shock front in white-light.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME and Shock Tracking**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 15:32:56 UT to 15:40:56 UT (2017 September 2)
      - **Supporting Context**: “...the CME driver and shock front were tracked using base difference images from SUVI and LASCO C2 until both the shock and CME expanded outside the instrument’s field of view.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light)
   - **Physical Observable**: White-light signatures of the CME front and shock as it propagates outward in the corona; used in conjunction with EUV observations to build a height-time profile.
   - **Additional Comments**: The white-light images complement the EUV data, allowing for cross-verification of CME kinematics and the derived Alfvén Mach number.

### 3. WIND/WAVES RAD1 on board WIND
- **General Comments**:
   - WIND/WAVES RAD1 is one of the radio spectrographic channels provided by the WIND mission that observes low-frequency radio emissions.
   - It is used to capture radio dynamic spectra that can include solar radio burst signatures.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...WIND/WAVES spectrographs RAD1 (20–1040 kHz)...”
- **Data Collection Period 1**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the text.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 20–1040 kHz
      - **Supporting Quote**: “WIND/WAVES RAD1 (20–1040 kHz)”
   - **Physical Observable**: Radio dynamic spectra at very low frequencies; these frequencies are sensitive to plasma emission from shock-related processes in the outer corona and solar wind.
   - **Additional Comments**: Although specific time stamps are not mentioned, the RAD1 data contribute to the overall radio context of the event.

### 4. WIND/WAVES RAD2 on board WIND
- **General Comments**:
   - WIND/WAVES RAD2 is the complementary channel to RAD1, covering higher radio frequencies.
   - It also records dynamic spectra which provide insight into the evolving radio emissions associated with the CME-driven shock.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...WIND/WAVES RAD2 (0.5-16 MHz)...”
- **Data Collection Period 1**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the text.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Approximately 0.5–16 MHz
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...WIND/WAVES RAD2 (0.5-16 MHz)...”
   - **Physical Observable**: Medium frequency radio emissions, contributing vital information on the shock’s radio signature when combined with other instruments.
   - **Additional Comments**: Together with RAD1, RAD2 helps in constructing a comprehensive view of the radio environment during the event.

### 5. I-LOFAR (Irish Low Frequency Array)
- **General Comments**:
   - I-LOFAR is a ground-based low-frequency radio array dedicated to high-resolution solar radio spectroscopy.
   - It is used in this study to observe the type II radio burst, capturing both its fundamental and harmonic components.

   - “Panel (i) shows the type II burst observed by I-LOFAR at ∼15:36 UT with relatively well defined fundamental and first harmonic components…”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Type II Radio Burst Observation**
   - **Time Range**: From approximately 15:36 UT (onset) to 15:48 UT (cessation) on 2017 September 2
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The type II radio emission emerged…when MA was in the range 1.4-2.4 at a heliocentric distance of ∼1.6 R⊙” and “...the emission ceased when the CME nose reached ∼2.4 R⊙ at ∼15:48 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 10–240 MHz
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...Irish Low Frequency Array (I-LOFAR) observing between 10-240 MHz…”
   - **Physical Observable**: Type II radio burst features including the distinct fundamental (~35 MHz initially) and first harmonic (~75 MHz) components; these observables are used to infer the shock’s density jump and Mach number via the band-splitting effect.
   - **Additional Comments**: I-LOFAR’s data are central to Method 3 (band-splitting) for deriving shock parameters and understanding the electron acceleration processes at play.
