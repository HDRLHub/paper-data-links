## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on follow‐up observations of the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its active bursting phase in 2020. The H.E.S.S. array was triggered by high‐intensity X‐ray alerts from Swift-BAT and subsequently observed the source for VHE (E > 600 GeV) gamma rays during a period that coincided with several X-ray bursts detected by instruments such as INTEGRAL and Fermi-GBM. In addition, contemporaneous and follow-up multiwavelength observations were performed by a variety of instruments in the X-ray, gamma-ray, radio, and optical bands – including Swift-BAT, INTEGRAL, Fermi-GBM, Konus-Wind, AGILE, HXMT, NICER/XTI, NuSTAR, and several radio telescopes (CHIME, STARE2, FAST, Westerbork RT1, Onsala, Toru´n, Arecibo, Effelsberg, LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2 and Northern Cross) as well as optical facilities (BOOTES-3, LCOGT, MeerLICHT). Each of these instruments contributed either by triggering the observations, providing independent verification of burst events, or setting upper limits on transient or persistent emission during the active phase.
