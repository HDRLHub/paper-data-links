## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the relative contributions of Lorentz forces and aerodynamic drag on the propagation of 38 Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed during the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24 (2010–2013). The research utilizes direct imaging data from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and multiple instruments from the Sun–Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) suite, including coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HI) onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO). For each event, precise 3D modeling is performed using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) technique, which is applied to contemporaneous multi-viewpoint data from SOHO/LASCO C2, STEREO-A and B COR2, and STEREO HI1/HI2. In-situ solar wind plasma measurements at 1 AU are obtained from the Wind spacecraft to inform boundary conditions and to extrapolate plasma parameters sunward for force calculations. CMEs are only included if they are observed as clear, bright structures across all relevant instruments, with particular attention paid to event continuity and exclusion of complex interactions. These multi-instrument observations and derived measurements are directly processed and analyzed to determine propagation profiles, force dominance regimes, and model validation across a set of specific, fully-documented event dates between March 2010 and December 2013.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO C2 imaging was used as a primary source of white-light coronagraph data for CME onset and kinematic profiling as part of the multi-spacecraft triangulation enabling accurate 3D modeling with the GCS technique. Only events with clear, continuous LASCO C2 coverage were included and analyzed.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The primary data we use is from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagaph (LASCO: Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission (SOHO)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sample of 38 CMEs during Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: 2010–2013, with explicit event dates for all 38 events between 2010-03-19 and 2013-12-07 UT  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We investigate CMEs observed during the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24 between 2010 and 2013. ... The 38 CMEs we identify for this work have near-Sun speeds ranging from 50 kms−1 to 2400 kms−1."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The primary data we use is from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagaph (LASCO: Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission (SOHO)..."
- **Physical Observable**: CME appearance, 2D/3D kinematics (height-time profile), structural geometry
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS: Thernisien, Howard, and Vourlidas, 2006; Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard, 2009; Thernisien, 2011) model to ﬁt the visible CME structure."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The first C2 appearance date/time for each event (with event number, date, and UT) is given in Table 1.
  - Only LASCO C2 observations with sufficient clarity and continuity are incorporated.
  - The GCS model requires LASCO C2 as a triangulation anchor for accurate CME 3D localization.

### Sun–Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) Coronagraphs and HI onboard STEREO (A & B)
- **General Comments**:
  - Imaging data from STEREO's SECCHI suite was a critical element for multi-viewpoint stereoscopic modeling, providing simultaneous coronagraph (COR2) and heliospheric imager (HI1 and HI2) coverage. Data from both STEREO-Ahead and STEREO-Behind were directly fitted for GCS model parameters. Only events with unbroken, high-quality visibility in both STEREO coronagraphs and HI were selected.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "...and Sun – Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI: Howard et al., 2008) coronagraphs and the Heliospheric Imagers (HI) onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory mission (STEREO; Kaiser et al., 2008)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sample of 38 CMEs across both STEREO spacecraft
- **Time Range**: 2010–2013, with each event's specific CME observation dates between 2010-03-19 and 2013-12-07 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The 38 CMEs we identify for this work have near-Sun speeds ranging from 50 kms−1 to 2400 kms−1. ... The respective separations of the STEREO B and A spacecraft from the Earth vary from 71◦and 66◦in March 2010 to about 149◦and 150◦by the end of 2013."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "...the LASCO C2 coronagraph, the three point view provides a favourable set up for observing Earth-directed CMEs. We only include CMEs that have continuous observations in LASCO C2, STEREO-A and -B COR 2, HI1 and HI2."
- **Physical Observable**: CME brightness and morphology, 3D kinematics, propagation in the coronagraph and heliospheric imager fields of view, geometrical evolution
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS: Thernisien, Howard, and Vourlidas, 2006; Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard, 2009; Thernisien, 2011) model to ﬁt the visible CME structure."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - For each event, images from STEREO-A and -B COR2, HI1, and (for 8 events) HI2 were used for GCS fitting.
  - "We only include CMEs that have continuous observations in LASCO C2, STEREO-A and -B COR 2, HI1 and HI2. We require that the images from all the instruments must include the CMEs as clear, bright structures. Events with major distortions and CME – CME interactions were excluded."
  - Table 1 and Table 2 provide per-event observation details including derived physical parameters from GCS fits based on these data.

### Wind Spacecraft (in-situ plasma measurements)
- **General Comments**:
  - Wind's in-situ proton number density and solar wind velocity measurements at 1 AU are used as direct observational inputs for ambient conditions relevant to each CME event, enabling calculation of key quantities (n_sw and V_sw) for CME force modeling.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "In-situ measurements are obtained from the Wind spacecraft1, which gives the near-Earth parameters for these CMEs."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Per-event 1 AU solar wind condition sampling for each CME
- **Time Range**: For each CME event, corresponding to near-Earth passage intervals from 2010–2013, with observed plasma values reported in Table 1 by event
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The quantity nwind and vwind are the proton number density and solar wind velocity at 1 AU as observed in-situ by the Wind spacecraft. These observed values are extrapolated sunward for use in Fdrag for calculating nsw and Vsw in Equation 1."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in-situ plasma parameters: number density and bulk speed)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "nwind and vwind are the observed proton number density and solar wind speed at 1 AU respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind plasma proton number density, bulk velocity at 1 AU
