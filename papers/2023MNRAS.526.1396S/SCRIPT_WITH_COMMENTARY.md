    end_time = f"{date}T23:59:59"
    time_range = a.Time(start_time, end_time)
    
    # Construct the query
    query = Fido.search(time_range, sumer_instrument, sumer_wavelength_range)
    
    # Display the query results

### Explanation:
1. **Import Libraries**: We import necessary modules from `sunpy.net` and `astropy.units`. `Fido` is used for querying and downloading data, while `attrs as a` provides attributes to refine the search.
2. **Define Variables**: We specify the instrument (`SUMER` on `SOHO`) and the wavelength range (660 to 1610 Ã…) which covers the UV spectrum relevant to the study.
3. **Loop Over Dates**: Since there are two specific dates for detailed observations, we loop over these dates to create and execute queries for each.
4. **Time Range Setup**: For each date, we define the entire day as the time range for the observations.
5. **Query Construction**: Using `Fido.search`, we construct the query with the specified time range, instrument, and wavelength.
6. **Print Query Results**: The results of the query are printed to provide an overview of the available data for each date.
7. **Data Download**: The download command is commented out to prevent automatic execution but can be uncommented when the user wishes to actually download the data.

This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the study, focusing on the accurate retrieval of data for the specified dates and conditions.
