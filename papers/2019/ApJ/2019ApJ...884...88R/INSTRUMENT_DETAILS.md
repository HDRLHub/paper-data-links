## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the evolution of the plasma β parameter (the ratio of kinetic to magnetic pressure) in the solar atmosphere during solar cycles 23 and 24. The study reconstructs plasma β at different heights in the corona (from 1.14 R☉ to 1.90 R☉) and in the photosphere by using an updated version of the COronal DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model. To achieve this, the authors assimilate magnetic field data obtained from instruments such as MDI/SOHO and HMI/SDO through a flux transport model and a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) method. For photospheric temperature values, the study uses semi‐empirical FALC models which were calibrated to match SORCE/SIM observations. The paper also refers to complementary datasets (e.g., IMaX) from other studies to place its results in the context of recent work on magnetic field and plasma parameters in the solar atmosphere. The overall analysis covers an observation (or data assimilation) period from July 1, 1996 to August 23, 2018, thereby encompassing nearly two complete solar cycles.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. MDI/SOHO – Michelson Doppler Imager on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI/SOHO is referenced as a source of magnetic field measurements. In this study, however, the measured magnetic field strength from MDI/SOHO is not directly used; instead the data are assimilated into a flux transport model (Schrijver 2001) that underpins the coronal magnetic structure reconstruction.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "In this approach, we could not directly employ the magnetic field strength density from MDI/SOHO (Scherrer et al. 1995) and HMI/SDO (Scherrer et al. 2012). These data are assimilated into the flux transport model of Schrijver (2001)."
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - Not explicitly provided for MDI/SOHO in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No specific dates are mentioned for MDI/SOHO; its data are assumed to contribute to the flux transport model used throughout the study period.)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not specified.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The paper does not detail the wavelength range or detector specifics of MDI.)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Magnetic field strength (photospheric magnetograms are used for magnetic flux assimilation).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implicit in the discussion of magnetic field density measurements.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The data from MDI/SOHO contribute indirectly by seeding the models that reconstruct the solar corona’s magnetic field.

### 2. HMI/SDO – Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI/SDO is similarly referenced for its magnetic field measurements; as with MDI/SOHO, the measured data from HMI/SDO are not used directly but are assimilated into the flux transport model, thereby influencing the coronal magnetic calculations in the CODET model framework.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "In this approach, we could not directly employ the magnetic field strength density from MDI/SOHO (Scherrer et al. 1995) and HMI/SDO (Scherrer et al. 2012)..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - Not explicitly provided for HMI/SDO in the article.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The paper does not specify a data collection period for HMI/SDO; its magnetic datasets are part of the integrated flux transport model.)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not detailed.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (There is no mention of the specific wavelength band or detector characteristics for HMI/SDO in the context of this work.)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Magnetic field strength (obtained from full-disk magnetograms used in the flux transport model).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Inferred from the discussion of using magnetogram data for solar magnetic flux modelling.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - HMI/SDO data provide a modern complement to earlier MDI/SOHO observations, ensuring the model spans the observational period that covers solar cycles 23 and 24.

### 3. IMaX – Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment
- **General Comments**:
   - The IMaX instrument is mentioned in reference to related work. Specifically, Wiegelmann et al. (2015) are noted as having obtained new constraints using IMaX data in the context of non-linear magnetostatic modeling for the photosphere and chromosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Recently, Wiegelmann et al. (2015) obtained some new constraints with IMaX data with a non-linear magnetostatic model for the photosphere and chromosphere on network elements."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - The paper does not provide specific start and end dates for the IMaX observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No explicit data collection period is mentioned for IMaX data in the text.)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The paper does not include details regarding the observed wavelengths or detector characteristics of IMaX.)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Magnetic field properties, as inferred by its use in magnetostatic modeling.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implicit within the discussion on magnetic field measurements from IMaX.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although not directly used in this paper’s analysis, the mention of IMaX underscores the importance of high-resolution magnetometry for understanding magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere.

### 4. SORCE/SIM – Spectral Irradiance Monitor on board SORCE
- **General Comments**:
   - SORCE/SIM is referenced in relation to supporting the semi-empirical FALC model. The FALC model, which describes temperature profiles for solar features (Quiet Sun and Faculae) in the photosphere, was designed to yield a behavior of spectrally integrated radiative losses that better match SORCE/SIM observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "FALC model describes semi-empirical atmospheric models of solar features such as Quiet Sun and Faculae. These models are created [to] assure a reasonable behavior of spectrally integrated radiative losses and to better match the SORCE/SIM observations (Fontenla et al. 2011)."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - No specific observation dates are provided for SORCE/SIM within this paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The text does not mention an explicit time range for SORCE/SIM; it is noted solely as a calibration reference for the FALC model.)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not detailed in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (There are no details provided on the wavelength coverage or detector specifics of SORCE/SIM in this study.)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Spectrally integrated radiative losses (or spectral irradiance), which are key for matching the solar atmospheric temperature structure.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Derived from the mention of "spectrally integrated radiative losses" and the use of the FALC model adjusted to SORCE/SIM data.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - SORCE/SIM serves as an independent observational benchmark against which the FALC model’s temperature values are validated, thereby indirectly influencing the plasma β estimations in the photospheric layer.
