# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper re-examines the claimed detection of solar g modes by Fossat et al. (2017) using a 16.5 year-long time series of solar global velocity observations. The analysis involves dividing the data into 8‑hour segments (with a 4‑hr cadence) and then measuring the round-trip travel-time of the p modes. Multiple sensitivity tests are performed – such as adjustments to the start time of the time series, variations in the smoothing of the power spectrum, and changes in the cadence of round-trip travel-time measurements – which all reveal that the detection of g modes is extremely fragile. In addition to the GOLF instrument data used in the study, the authors suggest that repeating the analysis with other instruments (both space‑based and ground‑based) could help verify or disprove the findings.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. GOLF Instrument on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument provided the critical solar global velocity observations used in this study. The data from this instrument were used to derive the round-trip travel-time of sound waves (p modes) that, in turn, were analyzed to search for perturbations caused by g modes.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "We downloaded the 16.5 year-long time series of the solar global velocity observations from the GOLF instrument provided at https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/golf/templates/access.html."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Full GOLF Time Series Analysis
- **Time Range**: 16.5 years (Exact start and end dates are not specified in the paper)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "The GOLF velocity time series is 16.5 years long with an 80 s cadence."
- **Wavelength(s)**: The analysis focused on a filtered frequency band corresponding to 2.32–3.74 mHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "We filtered this power spectrum for the frequency band between 2.32 and 3.74 mHz..."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar global velocity – specifically the measurement of the round-trip travel-time of p modes, which is sensitive to the solar mean density and is perturbed by the g modes.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "...measurements of the round-trip travel-time of the p modes..."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The data were divided into 36,130 segments each 8 hours long, with a 4‑hr measurement cadence. Segments with less than a 25% duty cycle were excluded from the analysis.

### 2. MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI is mentioned as a potential alternative space‑based observational instrument that could be used for an independent test of the g-mode detection.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "It would be valuable to repeat the analysis using other observational data sets from space (MDI, HMI)..."
- **Time Range**: Not specified in the paper.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: No additional details regarding detectors, wavelength coverage, or studied physical observables are provided.

### 3. HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is cited as another space‑based instrument that could offer an independent data set for verifying the g-mode analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "It would be valuable to repeat the analysis using other observational data sets from space (MDI, HMI)..."
- **Time Range**: Not specified.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: Specific detector characteristics and observed physical quantities are not discussed in the paper.

### 4. BiSON (Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network)
- **General Comments**:
   - BiSON is referenced as a ground‑based instrument that, alongside other networks, could potentially be used to re‐examine the presence of solar g modes.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "...and from the ground (BiSON, GONG)..."
- **Time Range**: Not specified.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: No detailed information on the wavelengths measured or the physical parameters observed by BiSON is provided in the paper.

### 5. GONG (Global Oscillation Network Group)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG, another ground‑based observational network, is mentioned as a candidate for future studies aimed at verifying the g-mode detection results.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "...and from the ground (BiSON, GONG)."
- **Time Range**: Not specified.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: The paper does not offer further details regarding the detector configuration or the specific physical observables for GONG.

### 6. PLATO Mission Instrumentation
- **General Comments**:
   - PLATO is mentioned in the context of applying the analysis method to stellar observations of Sun‑like stars in future research, although it is not used in the current study.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "...the method could potentially be applied to stellar observations of Sun-like stars, for example from PLATO (Rauer et al., 2014) observations."
- **Time Range**: Not applicable; PLATO is referenced as a future mission rather than a source of data used in this study.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: No details regarding detector specifics or the wavelengths and physical observables for PLATO are provided.
