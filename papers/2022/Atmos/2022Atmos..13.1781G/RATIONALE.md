# Import necessary modules from SunPy
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
import astropy.units as u

# Context: We want to construct queries to download data for the following instruments:
# 1. LASCO on SOHO for CME observations
# 2. EIT on SOHO for early CME development
# 3. Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) for filament eruptions and CME core observations
# 4. SDO/AIA for active region eruptions and flare observations
# 5. Wind/WAVES for radio bursts during solar eruptions
# 6. Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter for ongoing observations

# Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We will create individual queries for each instrument based on the provided context.

# 1. LASCO on SOHO for CME observations
print("Querying LASCO on SOHO for CME observations...")
lasco_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('1996-01-01', '2021-11-30'),
    a.Instrument('LASCO'),
    a.Physobs('intensity')
)
print(lasco_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# lasco_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_query)

# 2. EIT on SOHO for early CME development
print("Querying EIT on SOHO for early CME development...")
eit_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('1996-01-01', '1998-06-30'),
    a.Instrument('EIT'),
    a.Physobs('intensity')
)
print(eit_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# eit_files = Fido.fetch(eit_query)

# 3. Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) for filament eruptions and CME core observations
print("Querying Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) for filament eruptions and CME core observations...")
norh_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('1997-10-06', '1997-10-06'),
    a.Instrument('NoRH'),
    a.Wavelength(17 * u.GHz)
)
print(norh_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# norh_files = Fido.fetch(norh_query)

# 4. SDO/AIA for active region eruptions and flare observations
print("Querying SDO/AIA for active region eruptions and flare observations...")
aia_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('2011-08-04', '2011-08-04'),
    a.Instrument('AIA'),
    a.Wavelength(193 * u.Angstrom)
)
print(aia_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# aia_files = Fido.fetch(aia_query)

# 5. Wind/WAVES for radio bursts during solar eruptions
print("Querying Wind/WAVES for radio bursts during solar eruptions...")
waves_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('2005-01-15', '2005-01-15'),
    a.Instrument('WAVES'),
    a.Wavelength(0.01 * u.MHz, 14 * u.MHz)
)
print(waves_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# waves_files = Fido.fetch(waves_query)

# 6. Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter for ongoing observations

psp_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('2018-10-31', '2023-10-01'),
    a.Instrument('WISPR')
)
print(psp_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# psp_files = Fido.fetch(psp_query)

so_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('2020-05-12', '2023-10-01'),
    a.Instrument('EUI')

This script queries the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for data from various instruments as specified in the context. Each query is constructed based on the time range, instrument, and physical observable provided. The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out to prevent automatic downloading of data. The results of each query are printed for review.
