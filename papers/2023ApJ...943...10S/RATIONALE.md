**produce the script**. We need to construct Python scripts using the SunPy library to query solar data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) based on the context provided. The context involves two specific instruments: the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on SOHO and the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on Hinode. We will focus on the time ranges and physical observables mentioned in the context.

### Script for MDI on SOHO

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the observation period for MDI on SOHO
mdi_start_date = '1996-01-01'
mdi_end_date = '2001-12-31'
mdi_time_range = a.Time(mdi_start_date, mdi_end_date)

# Instrument details
mdi_instrument = a.Instrument("MDI")

# Construct the query for MDI data
mdi_query = Fido.search(mdi_time_range, mdi_instrument)

# Display the query results for MDI
print("Query for MDI on SOHO:")
print(mdi_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# mdi_files = Fido.fetch(mdi_query)
```

### Script for SOT on Hinode

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the observation period for SOT on Hinode
# Note: Exact dates are not specified, so we assume a broad range around the publication year
sot_start_date = '2010-01-01'
sot_end_date = '2012-12-31'
sot_time_range = a.Time(sot_start_date, sot_end_date)

# Instrument details
sot_instrument = a.Instrument("SOT")

# Construct the query for SOT data
sot_query = Fido.search(sot_time_range, sot_instrument)

# Display the query results for SOT
print("Query for SOT on Hinode:")
print(sot_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# sot_files = Fido.fetch(sot_query)
```

### Explanation

1. **Time Range**: For MDI, the time range is explicitly mentioned (1996 â€“ 2001). For SOT, since the exact dates are not specified, we assume a range around the publication year (2011) to cover potential data collection periods.
2. **Instruments**: We use the `a.Instrument` attribute to specify MDI and SOT based on the context.
3. **Query Construction**: We use `Fido.search` to construct queries for each instrument based on the time range and instrument specification.
4. **Results Display**: The script prints out the results of the queries. This allows verification of the data availability and the specifics of the data that can be fetched.
5. **Data Download**: The actual download commands are commented out to prevent unintentional data fetching during script testing or review.

This approach ensures that the scripts are aligned with the context provided and adhere to the requirements of querying specific instruments and time ranges as mentioned in the scientific observation details.
