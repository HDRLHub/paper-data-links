## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the release of solar energetic particles (SEPs) during the 2012 January 27 solar eruption. It combines multipoint remote-sensing imaging and in situ measurements from several spacecraft to determine the timing of particle injection and the magnetic connectivity between the eruption site and various observers (near‐Earth and STEREO). Remote-sensing observations of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves and white-light (WL) signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are compared with in situ particle and solar wind measurements. The study uses precise timing—from flare onset to shock connection times—to evaluate whether EUV waves, shock expansion, or both play a role in releasing energetic particles.
