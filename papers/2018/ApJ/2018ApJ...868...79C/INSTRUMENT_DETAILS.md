## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a split‐band Type II solar radio burst that is associated with a CME event on 2015 June 25. The study uses high‐cadence, high-resolution radio imaging and spectroscopy from LOFAR to track the evolution and spatial separation of the upper and lower sub-band sources of the burst. Complementary observations from white-light coronagraphs (SOHO/LASCO C2) trace the evolving CME, while SDO/AIA images help to identify the solar surface activity and coronal dimming region that mark the CME’s origin. An earlier imaging instrument (the Nanҫay Radioheliograph, NRH) is also referenced to highlight the improved capabilities of LOFAR. Detailed timing—from as early as 10:46 UT for the radio burst and 10:57 UT for the CME appearance in C2, to observations of dimming around 9:50 UT—provides a multi-instrument overview crucial for exploring band-splitting interpretations and the effects of radio-wave scattering on the apparent source locations.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. LOFAR – The Low Frequency Array
- **General Comments**:
   - LOFAR is the primary instrument used to observe the solar radio emissions in this study. It consists of two types of antennas – the Low-Band Antenna (LBA), composed of dipoles, and the High-Band Antenna (HBA), composed of tiles. For this event, observations were conducted using LOFAR’s outer LBA core stations in a Coherent Stokes beam-formed mode that produces a tied-array beam. LOFAR’s high temporal (∼10 ms cadence) and spectral (∼12 kHz sampling) resolution are crucial for capturing the rapidly evolving radio sources.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we examine the spatial and temporal relation of the Type II burst to the associated CME event… LOFAR consists of two main types of antennas: the Low-Band Antenna (LBA) composed of dipoles, and the High-Band Antenna (HBA) composed of tiles, and collectively it covers a frequency range of 10 −240 MHz.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Type II Burst and Band-Splitting Observation
- **Time Range**: 10:46:00 UT – 10:48:00 UT on 2015 June 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Splitting of this feature in two thinner lanes is also observed between 10:46:00 and 10:48:00 UT defining the band-splitting region recorded.”
- **Wavelength(s)/Frequency Range**: 30 to 80 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The Type II burst was observed by LOFAR for 4128 consecutive frequencies across a bandwidth of 50.4 MHz between 30 and 80 MHz…”
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emission showing characteristic slow frequency drift and split-band features in Type II bursts.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “A brighter than the background feature that slowly drifts to lower frequencies as time increases (by ∼−0.1 MHz s−1) is observed…”
- **Additional Comments**: LOFAR’s beam-formed imaging mode allowed nearly simultaneous source imaging for both the upper and lower sub-bands, which is critical for comparing their spatial positions without time delay ambiguities.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Observation of Type III Bursts
- **Time Range**: Approximately 10:47:43 UT on 2015 June 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Type III radio bursts identified by their high frequency drift rates and short lifetimes were also observed during the Type II observation… a point from the higher frequency and a point from the lower frequency Type II sub-band ... and points along the Type III burst (black crosses) were selected…”
- **Wavelength(s)/Frequency Range**: Although specific frequencies are not given beyond the context of simultaneous observation with the 30–80 MHz range, the Type III are noted by their faster drift.
- **Physical Observable**: High drift rate and short lifetime bursts indicating open magnetic field structures.
- **Additional Comments**: The Type III burst data provide additional context on the active coronal region and source geometry during the event.

### 2. SOHO/LASCO C2 Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/LASCO C2 is used to capture white-light images of the CME associated with the Type II radio burst. The instrument images coronal structures within a field-of-view spanning 1.5 –6 R⊙, although it is limited to imaging only beyond ∼2.2 R⊙.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Coronagraphic white-light images of the CME were captured by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995) Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995)... which covers a distance range of 1.5 −6 R⊙, but can only image beyond 2.2 R⊙.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Observation at Later Phase
- **Time Range**: CME first appearance at ∼10:57:00 UT on 2015 June 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: “A CME event was observed by the LASCO C2 coronagraph emerging from the south-west part of the solar limb. The eruption first appears in the C2 field-of-view at ∼10:57 UT…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband optical imaging)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Coronagraphic white-light images…”
- **Physical Observable**: The radial and lateral propagation of the CME front and its evolution.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The left panel of Figure 2 illustrates the CME’s propagation in the radial direction...”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Earlier CME Event in Background
- **Time Range**: An earlier CME observed at ∼8:36:00 UT (provides background context)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…but can only image beyond 2.2 R⊙. Beyond that range, the CME dissolves into the background which is dominated by an earlier CME event that was observed by C2 at ∼8:36 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
- **Physical Observable**: The existence of a previous CME which influences the background coronal structure.
- **Additional Comments**: The earlier CME event’s presence was used to help interpret the evolution of the later CME and its association with radio emissions.

### 3. SDO/AIA (Solar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging Assembly)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA observations are used to examine the solar surface and observe coronal dimming near the active region, which is believed to be the origin of the CME. AIA provides high-resolution imaging at multiple wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) are also used to identify the origin of the eruption with respect to activities on the solar surface.”

#### Data Collection Period: Active Region Dimming Observation
- **Time Range**: Approximately 9:50:00 UT on 2015 June 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: “AIA imaging shows that at ∼9:50 UT there is considerable dimming of the Southern part of the active region from which the CME… originated…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths; specific channels mentioned include 171 Å and an inset image at 193 Å.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 3… a combination of data from SDO/AIA at 171˚A… The inset is a running ratio image of SDO/AIA observations at 193˚A.”
- **Physical Observable**: Dimming associated with density depletion and mass loss, indicative of CME initiation.
- **Additional Comments**: The dimming observed by AIA provides temporal correlation with the back-extrapolated CME eruption time and supports the identification of the active region as the CME’s source region.

### 4. Nanҫay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NRH is cited as an earlier instrument capable of imaging solar radio emissions. Its imaging capability was limited to up to 10 non-consecutive frequencies in the range of approximately 150–450 MHz, preventing simultaneous imaging of both the upper and lower sub-band sources that LOFAR can capture.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…LOFAR’s imaging capability represents a significant improvement over previous instruments capable of source imaging, like the NRH which could image at up to 10 non-consecutive frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz…”
- **Time Range**: Specific observation times are not provided for NRH in this study.
   - **Supporting Quote**: The paper only references NRH in a historical context regarding its frequency coverage.
- **Wavelength(s)/Frequency Range**: Approximately 150–450 MHz (non-consecutive frequencies).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…NRH which could image at up to 10 non-consecutive frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz…”
- **Physical Observable**: Radio source imaging, though without the simultaneous multi-frequency capability required to fully resolve split-band features as in the present LOFAR observations.
- **Additional Comments**: NRH is mentioned for comparative purposes, highlighting the advances in spatial and temporal resolution provided by LOFAR.
