## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the puzzling detection of high‐energy (≥100 MeV) γ‐rays from behind-the‐limb (BTL) solar flares using a suite of remote‐sensing observations and data‐driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. The authors focus on the September 1, 2014 (SOL2014-09-01) event and compare it with other events (e.g., the 2012 March 7 and 2017 September 10 flares). Key observational instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum—from γ‐ray to radio wavelengths—are employed to characterize the flare, its associated coronal mass ejection (CME), and the CME‐driven shock that may accelerate particles. The paper discusses temporal evolution (from minutes up to several hours) of emission signatures that correlate with simulated shock properties, magnetic field configuration, and particle acceleration mechanisms.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope (Fermi: LAT and GBM)
- **General Comments**:
   - Fermi is central to the study as it provides high-energy γ‐ray observations. Its Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects >100 MeV γ‐rays while the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) records lower energy (<100 MeV) emissions. These observations are used to differentiate between γ‐rays produced by the CME-driven shock versus those possibly originating at the flare loop-top.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Recent detections of high-energy γ-rays from behind-the-limb (BTL) solar flares by the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope…” (Abstract)
   - “...the LAT light curve decays very gradually with emission detected for almost two hours, while all other emissions last less than one hour…” (Section 2)
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: The SOL2014-09-01 Event (Fermi/LAT)
- **Time Range**: During the SOL2014-09-01 flare—γ-ray emission was detected for almost two hours.  
   - **Note**: The exact UT start and end times are not explicitly stated, but the event is identified as occurring on September 1, 2014 with a multi-hour duration.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the centroid of the Fermi/LAT source is about 300″ northwest of the RHESSI source and the corresponding light curve is different... with emission detected for almost two hours...” (Section 2)

#### Data Collection Period 2: Other Long-duration γ-ray Flares (Fermi/LAT)
- **Time Range**: Includes events such as the 2012 March 7 flare—with a duration of about 20 hours—and the 2017 September 10 flare.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Examples include the 2011 March 7 – 8 … and the 2017 September 10 flares, during which the centroid of the γ-ray source coincided well with the active region … This is also the case for the initial phase of the stronger 2012 March 7 flare, which lasted for about 20 hours…” (Section 2)

#### Data Collection Period 3: Impulsive Phase Observations (Fermi/GBM)
- **Time Range**: Recorded during the impulsive phase (typically less than 1 hour, with durations on the order of <10^3 seconds).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “These flares were also detected in HXRs by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), and Wind/Konus with similar time profiles…” (Section 2)

### 2. STEREO-B Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO-B provides complementary white-light and EUV observations. In this study, its COR1 coronagraph data is used to observe the fast CME and to help reconstruct the CME height-time profile in conjunction with SOHO/LASCO.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The top panel of Figure 3 shows the observations from SOHO/LASCO C2 and STEREO-B/COR1.” (Section 3.1)

#### Data Collection Period: STEREO-B/COR1 Observations
- **Time Range**: During the SOL2014-09-01 event; while an exact UT window is not specified, the imagery is contemporaneous with the LASCO C2 observation beginning at 11:12:05 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...a fast CME observed by both SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-B/COR1 with a speed >1900 km s−1…” (Section 2)

### 3. SOHO/LASCO Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO’s LASCO C2 (and also C3 in the height-time analysis) provides white-light coronagraph imaging which is critical for tracking the CME’s propagation and speed.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “With this assumption, the first appearance of CME in the LASCO C2 field of view (11:12:05 UT) corresponds to t = 10 minutes in the simulation.” (Section 3.1)

#### Data Collection Period: SOHO/LASCO C2 Observations
- **Time Range**: The observed CME appears at 11:12:05 UT on September 1, 2014; the subsequent evolution is tracked through the event.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Same as above)

### 4. Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI provides high-resolution hard X-ray (HXR) imaging and spectroscopy. In this event, its images capture a ~40″ HXR source just over the limb, indicative of the flare loop-top.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “RHESSI images show a HXR source with a size of about 40″ (∼30 Mm) just over the limb, which is consistent with (a part of) the loop-top source…” (Section 2)

#### Data Collection Period: Impulsive Phase Observations (RHESSI)
- **Time Range**: Observations occur during the impulsive phase of the flare, typically lasting less than one hour (≲10^3 seconds).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...all other <100 MeV emissions… have light curves very similar to the RHESSI HXRs…” (Section 2)

### 5. Wind/Konus
- **General Comments**:
   - Wind/Konus is used to sample hard X-rays during the flare. Its time profile closely mirrors that recorded by RHESSI and Fermi/GBM.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “These flares were also detected in HXRs by … Wind/Konus with similar time profiles…” (Section 2)

#### Data Collection Period: Hard X-ray Observations (Wind/Konus)
- **Time Range**: Occurs during the impulsive phase (typically less than 1 hour). Exact start and end times are not specified but are comparable to RHESSI observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Same as above)

### 6. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) – Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI provides high-resolution photospheric magnetograms used to reconstruct the global coronal magnetic field. In this study, the assimilated magnetograms are critical since the flare source region was not visible on the disk at the time of the event.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Synchronous magnetograms at (a) 2014-09-01 12:04:00 UT during the Sept14 Fermi BTL γ-ray flare and (b) 2014-09-08 00:04:00 UT, one week after the flare…” (Figure 1 caption and Section 3.1)

#### Data Collection Period 1: During the Event
- **Time Range**: 2014-09-01 12:04:00 UT  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Synchronous magnetograms at (a) 2014-09-01 12:04:00 UT during the Sept14 Fermi BTL γ-ray flare…” (Fig. 1)

#### Data Collection Period 2: Post-event Assimilation
- **Time Range**: 2014-09-08 00:04:00 UT  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the assimilated magnetogram on 2014 September 8 00:04:00 UT… is used to reconstruct the initial global coronal magnetic field.” (Section 3.1)

### 7. Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN)
- **General Comments**:
   - RSTN records microwave emissions during solar flares. Its observations complement the hard X-ray and γ-ray data by providing information on nonthermal electron populations during the impulsive phase.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...and in microwave by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN).” (Section 2)

#### Data Collection Period: Microwaves during the Impulsive Phase
- **Time Range**: Occurs during the impulsive phase (typically lasting less than one hour). Specific start and end times are not provided.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Same as above)

### 8. Cassini Spacecraft (In-situ Observation of Saturn’s Bow Shock)
- **General Comments**:
   - Although not a solar instrument, Cassini’s in-situ measurements of Saturn’s bow shock are cited as supporting evidence for particle acceleration at quasi‐perpendicular shocks. This comparison helps underline the efficiency of shock-driven acceleration in plasma environments.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...a recent in-situ observation of Saturn’s bow shock from the Cassini spacecraft (Masters et al. 2017) shows that energetic electrons were only detected downstream of the quasi-perpendicular shock…” (Section 4.2)

#### Data Collection Period: In-situ Saturnian Observations
- **Time Range**: The paper does not provide a specific time range for the Cassini observations; they are referenced as a recent measurement in the literature.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Same as above)
