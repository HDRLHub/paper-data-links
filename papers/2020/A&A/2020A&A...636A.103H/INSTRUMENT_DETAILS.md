## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how the proton‐proton collisional age (acol,p-p) can be used as a single ordering parameter to distinguish among different solar wind types, namely coronal hole wind, helmet-streamer plasma, and sector-reversal plasma. The study uses in situ measurements from several instruments that provide proton plasma properties, magnetic field data, and charge-state composition. The primary data set is drawn from observations made by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) over the period 2001–2010. In addition, a test case is performed on plasma data from the proton monitor onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), which does not have a magnetometer. The paper explores both a similarity-based method (similarity-PAC) and a data-driven distribution-based method (distribution-PAC) for deriving time-dependent thresholds in the collisional age, and discusses the implications of the solar activity cycle on these thresholds.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. ACE/MAG on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is the magnetometer onboard ACE. It provides the magnetic field strength (B) used in determining the proton-proton collisional age as well as in establishing a relationship with the proton plasma properties. It offers high-resolution (1-second) measurements which are 12-minute averaged for analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The magnetic field strength (B) is taken from ACE/MAG (Smith et al. 1998)”  
   - “we derived the mean direction over 12 minutes of the magnetic field vector, rotated the coordinate system in this direction, and computed from the 1s time resolution data from ACE/MAG…”

#### Data Collection Period:
- **Time Range**: 2001–2010  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Because the operational state of ACE/SWICS was altered due to radiation and an age-induced hardware anomaly in August 2011 and ACE/SWEPAM suffers from an increasing number of data gaps in later years, we restrict our analysis to 2001-2010.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (measures in situ magnetic field strength, not electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength (B) and its perpendicular variability.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...from the 1s time resolution data from ACE/MAG the length of the two perpendicular components of... determining B⊥/B.”
- **Additional Comments**: The magnetometer data, although not directly used in the PAC classification, is essential for cross-comparison with the proton plasma properties and to showcase that the required magnetic information is implicitly encoded in them.

### 2. ACE/SWICS on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) provides charge-state composition measurements, including the ratios nO7+/nO6+ and nC6+/nC5+ based on the ion densities (nO6+, nO7+, nC5+, nC6+). These data help in distinguishing solar wind types based on their compositional signatures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “the compositional information (the ratios nO7+/nO6+ and nC6+/nC5+ based on the ion densities nO6+, nO7+, nC5+, nC6+) from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS, Gloeckler et al. (1998))”

#### Data Collection Period:
- **Time Range**: 2001–2010  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “we restrict our analysis to 2001-2010.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (charge-state measurements do not involve electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Ion charge-state ratios.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...composition-based schemes exploit the oxygen and carbon charge-state composition of the solar wind...”
- **Additional Comments**: The data from ACE/SWICS form part of a combined data set with SWEPAM, resulting in a fixed 12-minute time resolution for consistency in the analysis.

### 3. ACE/SWEPAM on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Wind Electron Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) provides key proton plasma parameters such as proton speed (vp), proton density (np) and proton temperature (Tp). These parameters are crucial for calculating the proton-proton collisional age and are combined with SWICS data to yield a comprehensive set of observables.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “the proton plasma properties (proton speed vp, proton density np, and proton temperature Tp) from a combined data set of the Solar Wind Electron Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM, McComas et al. (1998)) and ACE/SWICS.”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Time Range**: 2001–2010  
      - **Supporting Quote**: “we restrict our analysis to 2001-2010.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (these are in situ particle measurements).
- **Physical Observable**: Proton speed, density, and temperature.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...proton speed, proton density, proton temperature… are all susceptible to transport effects.”
- **Additional Comments**: The combination of SWEPAM with SWICS data results in a uniform time resolution of 12 minutes, which facilitates the categorization of solar wind streams using the PAC approach.

### 4. SOHO/PM integrated in CELIAS/MTOF on board the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Proton Monitor (PM) is an auxiliary instrument connected to the mass time-of-flight (MTOF) sensor, which is part of the charge, element, and isotope analysis system (CELIAS). Unlike ACE, SOHO does not carry a magnetometer; thus, the PAC classification here relies solely on proton plasma measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “the PM is an auxiliary instrument to the mass time-of-flight (MTOF) sensor that is part of the charge, element, and isotope analysis system (CELIAS, Hovestadt et al. (1995)) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Time Range**: Example shown for DoY in 2005  
      - **Supporting Quote**: “An example of the resulting solar wind classification is shown in Fig. 9” and Fig. 9 caption indicates “DoY in 2005”, implying the solar wind streams were observed during this period.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (the instrument measures energetic particles, not electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Proton plasma properties including proton speed, density, and temperature.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...this simple method also leads to some misclassifications. For the most part, however, the solar wind classification behaves as expected: Sector-reversal plasma is mainly concentrated before and during stream interaction regions, and hot, fast, and thin solar wind streams are categorized as coronal hole wind.”
- **Additional Comments**: With no onboard magnetometer, the SOHO PM provides a test case for the distribution-PAC method applied to data sets that only include proton plasma measurements. Its proximity to L1 guarantees similar solar wind encounters as observed by ACE.
