# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the May 17th, 2012, solar energetic particle (SEP) Ground-Level Enhancement (GLE 71) event using sub-GeV proton time profiles derived directly from multiple spacecraft: SOHO, GOES 13, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL/RAD), STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and MESSENGER Neutron Spectrometer (NS). These spacecraft cover heliocentric distances from 0.34 to 1.5 AU and a wide range of longitudes. The study presents actual analyzed proton flux measurements from these instruments and compares them to numerical transport simulations. The specific observation date is May 17, 2012, with the event onset and evolution tracked over several subsequent days to analyze propagation characteristics, onset times, and peak intensities at each observer location, including both prompt SEP components and delayed or ESP-associated effects.

### High Energy Telescope (HET) on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
  - HET on STEREO-Ahead (STA) and STEREO-Behind (STB) provided direct 1-minute proton time profiles in 13–100 MeV, which are binned and analyzed for the event.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For STA and STB, we analyse 1-minute resolution data from HET of the In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation aboard both STEREOs. The protons are measured between 13 and 100 MeV in 11 different energy channels. For our purpose of comparing the STEREO measurement to those at other locations, we combine the energy channels into four different bins: 13–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, and 60–100 MeV."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SEP event main phase observation
- **Time Range**: 2012-05-17 01:25 UT (solar eruption) through at least 2012-05-19
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The energy-dependent time profiles of SEPs measured at five different heliospheric locations are shown in Figure 2."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 13–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, 60–100 MeV (proton energies)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The protons are measured between 13 and 100 MeV in 11 different energy channels. For our purpose...we combine the energy channels into four different bins: 13–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, and 60–100 MeV."
- **Physical Observable**: Differential proton intensity time profiles and onset/peak SEP fluxes across energy bins
  - **Supporting Quote**: "we assess proton time profiles from multiple instruments throughout the inner heliosphere. The energy-dependent time profiles of SEPs measured at five different heliospheric locations are shown in Figure 2."
- **Additional Comments**: Both ESP-associated (low-energy, shock-accelerated) and prompt SEP components analyzed.

### Neutron Spectrometer (NS) on board MESSENGER (MES)
- **General Comments**:
  - MESSENGER NS data are directly processed to produce proton time profiles at Mercury's orbit for various energy thresholds, through explicit channel-to-proton-flux conversions.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For MES data at Mercury, we use the neutron spectrometer which contains one borated plastic (BP) scintillator sandwiched between two Li glass (LG) scintillators."
- **Supporting Quote**: "We solve the intensity profile for 15–45 MeV and 45–125 MeV protons in the following way: We subtract the ≥45 MeV flux from the ≥15 MeV flux, and the ≥125 MeV flux from the ≥45 MeV flux."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SEP event and ESP detection at Mercury
- **Time Range**: 2012-05-17 01:25 UT to at least 2012-05-19
  - **Supporting Quote**: "MES, the circum-Mercurial orbital period of only 8 hours and related magnetospheric disturbances make identification of ICMEs challenging. Winslow et al. (2015) were able to detect an ICME at MES, lasting from 12:09 until 15:38 on May 17th."
- **Wavelength(s)**: ≥15 MeV (singles), ≥45 MeV (double), ≥125 MeV (triple) proton thresholds
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The energy thresholds for triggering each type of charged particle were simulated and derived using particle transport codes (Lawrence et al. 2014) and are as follows: single coincidence, ≥15 MeV protons... double coincidences, ≥45 MeV protons... and triple coincidences, ≥125 MeV protons..."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton differential intensities, including both initial solar acceleration and local ESP populations
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The time-series of proton measurements from MES using its neutron spectrometer (NS, Lawrence et al. 2016)"
- **Additional Comments**: Data explicitly filtered for high enough altitudes (>5000 km) to avoid local magnetospheric/planetary obstruction.

### Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on board Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)
- **General Comments**:
  - Proton particle energy spectra and dose rates are derived directly from MSL/RAD for the cruise phase to Mars, used to infer SEP onset and intensity time profiles at large heliocentric distance.
- **Supporting Quote**: "At MSL, during the cruise phase, the RAD instrument provided radiation dose measurements with a high time resolution of 64 seconds, and particle spectra with a time resolution of ~32 minutes. ...Protons stopping inside RAD can thus be selected and their intensities have been obtained in four energy channels: 12–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, and 60–100 MeV."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SEP GLE 71 onset and decay at ~1.5 AU
- **Time Range**: 2012-05-17 01:25 UT to at least 2012-05-19
  - **Supporting Quote**: "At MSL, during the cruise phase, the RAD instrument provided radiation dose measurements with a high time resolution of 64 seconds, and particle spectra with a time resolution of ~32 minutes. ...The 17th of May is DOY 138."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 12–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, 60–100 MeV (proton energies)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Protons stopping inside RAD can thus be selected and their intensities have been obtained in four energy channels: 12–24 MeV, 24–40 MeV, 40–60 MeV, and 60–100 MeV."
- **Physical Observable**: Stopping proton energy spectra and dose rates; SEP particle onset times and flux time profiles
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The radiation dose measurements were used to determine the event onset time. The particle spectra are provided by a particle telescope consisting of silicon detectors and plastic scintillators, with a viewing angle of ∼60° (Hassler et al. 2012), and providing proton detections up to a stopping energy of 100 MeV."
- **Additional Comments**: Paper discusses limitations and preliminary corrections for spacecraft shielding effects.
