## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on estimating the temperatures of heavy ions (Ti) in the solar corona, specifically at the polar coronal hole boundary. It examines the dependency of Ti on the ion charge-to-mass ratio (Z/A) using coordinated observations from the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode satellite and the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The study confirms the preferential heating of heavy ions in coronal holes and discusses the influence of instrumental broadening and non-Gaussian line profiles on Ti measurements. The findings provide new constraints on coronal heating models, highlighting the complex interactions and conditions at the polar coronal hole boundary.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - EIS is used to measure the ion temperatures and study their dependence on the ion charge-to-mass ratio at the polar coronal hole boundary. It observes in the extreme ultraviolet wavelength range and provides data critical for understanding coronal heating mechanisms.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coordinated observation with SUMER
- **Time Range**: 2007 November 16, 07:26 UT – 08:01 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "EIS observed this coronal hole from 07:26 UT to 08:01 UT in EUV from 170 to 210 ˚A (short wavelength, SW) and 245 to 290 ˚A (long wavelength, LW)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 170 to 210 ˚A (SW), 245 to 290 ˚A (LW)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "EIS observed this coronal hole from 07:26 UT to 08:01 UT in EUV from 170 to 210 ˚A (short wavelength, SW) and 245 to 290 ˚A (long wavelength, LW)."
- **Physical Observable**: Ion temperatures (Ti) and their dependence on Z/A
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To have better Z/A coverage and a comparison between different instruments, we used a coordinated observation by SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS."
- **Additional Comments**: The EIS data was processed with the latest calibrations available, and the observations were coaligned using EUV images from SOHO's Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT).

### Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SUMER is instrumental in providing measurements of ion temperatures at the polar coronal hole boundary. It observes in the ultraviolet spectrum and complements the observations made by EIS by covering different wavelengths and ions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coordinated observation with EIS
- **Time Range**: 2007 November 16, 09:01 UT – 10:03 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SUMER observed this region from 09:01 UT to 10:03 UT. The center of the 4′′ × 300′′ SUMER slit was pointed to (230′′, 1120′′), which covers the off-limb plasma from around 1.01 to 1.32 R⊙."
- **Wavelength(s)**: First-order wavelengths of 672–717 ˚A, 746–791 ˚A, 1015–1060 ˚A, and 1210–1255 ˚A
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SUMER detector B recorded the solar UV spectrum in four 45 ˚A wide spectrum windows."
- **Physical Observable**: Ion temperatures (Ti) and their dependence on Z/A
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To have better Z/A coverage and a comparison between different instruments, we used a coordinated observation by SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS."
- **Additional Comments**: SUMER data was corrected and calibrated following standard procedures, and the observations were coaligned using EUV images from SOHO's EIT.
