## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how magnetic flux cancelation in small, isolated active regions builds up and triggers eruptive events that produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study follows two such active regions—from their emergence to eruption—and examines the evolution of magnetic fields and filament/flux rope formation. Primary data are obtained from multiple instruments onboard different spacecraft (notably SDO’s AIA and HMI, supplemented by coronagraph images from SOHO/LASCO/C2 and STEREO/COR1, and contextual Hα images from GONG). The observations cover well‐defined time periods (e.g., from October 15–20, 2013, and July 11–16, 2010), enabling measurement of flux cancellation, filament formation, and eruption onset.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument images the Sun in multiple wavelength bands. It covers seven Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) channels (304 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 131 Å, 94 Å, 335 Å), two Ultraviolet (UV) channels (1600 Å and 1700 Å), and one visible band (4500 Å). It responds to plasma over a wide range of temperatures and provides full-disk solar images with a spatial resolution of 0.6″ per pixel. Typical cadences are 12 s for EUV channels and 24 s for the UV channels.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "For this study we use data from two instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). That satellite’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) images the Sun in seven EUV wavelength bands: 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A, in two UV bands: 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A, and in a visible band: 4500 ˚A."

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms that measure the magnetic field on the solar surface. It offers a pixel scale of 0.5″ and a cadence of 45 s. Its measurements are crucial for tracking the emergence, separation, convergence, and eventual cancelation of magnetic flux in the active regions.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Our magnetic data are from full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms from SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012), with 45 s cadence and 0′′.5 pixels."

- **Time Range**: 
   - **Emergence and Development**: Starting at approximately 14:00 UT on October 15, 2013, with surges noted around 04:00 UT on October 16 and 02:30 UT on October 18.
   - **Flux Convergence/Cancelation**: From around 03:00 UT on October 20, 2013, continuing through the eruption near 08:40 UT on October 20, 2013.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "From HMI magnetograms, AR 11868 [...] started emerging at about 14:00 UT on 2013 October 15... the two polarities start to converge ... from about 03:00 UT on October 20, and this convergence and cancelation continues through the time of the eruption near 08:40 UT on October 20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; HMI observes magnetic field in the visible spectrum via Doppler and magnetic line measurements.
- **Physical Observable**: The line-of-sight component of the solar magnetic field.
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data were key for quantifying flux cancellation rates and illustrating the evolution of the magnetic bipolar regions.

#### Data Collection Period 2: 2010 July Event (AR 11088)
- **Time Range**:
   - **Emergence**: AR 11088 emerged on July 11, 2010.

      - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 9 shows the magnetic evolution of AR 11088... over the five-day period from the region’s emergence until the eruption."
- **Wavelength(s)**: As above, HMI produces magnetograms in the visible light.
- **Physical Observable**: The temporal evolution of line-of-sight magnetic flux, used to infer flux cancellation with time.
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data provided the quantitative measurement of magnetic flux reduction (up to about 50% in one case) that was associated with the buildup to eruption.

### 3. SOHO/LASCO/C2 Coronagraph

- **General Comments**:
   - The COR1 coronagraph instruments on the STEREO spacecraft obtain white-light images of the corona and are used to contextualize the CME observations associated with the 2010 July eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 8 and the accompanying video show that a CME that likely originated from this eruption was visible in STEREO-B COR1 images ... beginning from 15:41:02 UT on 2010 July 16, and, from Figure 8(b)... STEREO-A COR1 shows what is likely the same CME from 16:30:18 UT."

### 5. GONG Hα Imaging System
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG Hα images provide chromospheric observations in the Hα spectral line (approximately 6563 Å). Although not the primary data source for the quantitative analyses in this paper, they are referenced to note the appearance and prominence of the filament in Hα prior to eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "(At times leading up to eruption, this ﬁlament is prominent in GONG Hα images, available at gong.nso.edu. Discussion of these images however is outside the focus of the current paper.)"

   - **Time Range**: Specific time stamps are not provided; however, the images are noted to capture the filament structure in the period leading up to the eruption (e.g., in the 2013 event before the eruption phase).
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα at approximately 6563 Å.
- **Physical Observable**: Chromospheric features such as filaments, seen through Hα emission/absorption.
- **Additional Comments**: While GONG Hα data furnished additional qualitative context regarding filament visibility, detailed analyses were centered on the AIA and magnetogram data.
