# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the analysis of three interplanetary shock-related energetic particle events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft. These events, occurring on 2005 May 15, 2012 July 14, and 2003 November 4, demonstrated flat ion energy spectra upstream of the shocks. The study interprets these observations through a velocity filter mechanism, which suggests that low-energy particles are confined to the shock front and cannot easily propagate upstream, while high-energy particles can. The paper utilizes data from various instruments on the ACE and Wind spacecraft to analyze particle fluxes, magnetic field fluctuations, and plasma conditions associated with these shocks.
