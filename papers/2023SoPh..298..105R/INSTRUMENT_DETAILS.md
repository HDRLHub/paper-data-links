## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with approximately 25 MeV solar energetic proton (SEP) events from 1980 to 2013. These events were observed in the low/inner corona by the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) using Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters. The study also integrates observations from space-based instruments like the Solar Maximum Mission C/P, P78-1 SOLWIND, and SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs. The primary aim is to understand the CME dynamics in the low to middle corona and their correlation with SEP acceleration. The paper discusses the potential of using ground-based observations for early detection and warning of SEP events, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of CMEs, especially if space-based observations are unavailable.

## Instrumentation Details

### Mk3 Coronameter on board Mauna Loa Solar Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The Mk3 Coronameter was used to image the solar corona and detect CMEs directly in the low corona. It provided valuable data on CME dynamics, which are crucial for understanding SEP acceleration.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from 1980 to 1999
- **Time Range**: February 4, 1980 – September 1999
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (polarized brightness)
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections
- **Additional Comments**: The Mk3 coronameter operated with a 3-minute cadence, providing crucial early data on CMEs in the low corona.

### Mk4 Coronameter on board Mauna Loa Solar Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - Mk4 Coronameter succeeded the Mk3 and continued the observation of CMEs in the low corona with improved capabilities.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from 1999 to 2013
- **Time Range**: September 1999 – Late 2013
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (polarized brightness)
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections
- **Additional Comments**: Mk4 provided data with a similar 3-minute cadence and extended the field of view, enhancing the observation of CME dynamics.

### Additional Space-Based Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - Space-based coronagraphs like SOHO/LASCO, Solar Maximum Mission C/P, and P78-1 SOLWIND were used to complement ground-based observations from MLSO.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Combined observations with MLSO instruments
- **Time Range**: Throughout the operational periods of Mk3 and Mk4 (1980-2013)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Various, depending on the instrument
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections in the middle to outer corona
- **Additional Comments**: These instruments provided crucial data for tracking CMEs beyond the field of view of ground-based coronameters, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of CME dynamics and their association with SEPs.
