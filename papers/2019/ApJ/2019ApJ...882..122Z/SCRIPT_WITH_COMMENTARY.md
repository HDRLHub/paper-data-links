This script queries SOHO/LASCO white‚Äêlight coronagraph data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO)
for two specific CME events described in the paper:
    1. The November 4, 1997 CME observed with LASCO (primarily using C2 and C3 imagers)
    2. The June 6, 2000 CME observed with LASCO

The VSO interface provided indicates that the LASCO instrument (with detectors C2 and C3) is available
from 1995/12/08 until the present. The only required values for the query are the time range and the instrument.
We use SunPy's Fido to perform two explicit queries for these events. (Fido.fetch commands are provided but commented out.)
