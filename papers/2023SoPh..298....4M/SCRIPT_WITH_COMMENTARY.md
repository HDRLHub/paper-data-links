```

This script constructs queries for the MDI and HMI instruments to retrieve data from the specified time ranges corresponding to Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The queries are designed to fetch photopheric Dopplergram maps, which are crucial for the helioseismic analysis discussed in the paper. The results of these queries are printed, and the data can be downloaded by uncommenting the `Fido.fetch` lines. This approach ensures that the script is aligned with the context provided and uses the correct instruments and time periods.
