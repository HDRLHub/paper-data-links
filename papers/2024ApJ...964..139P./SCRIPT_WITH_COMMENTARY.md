# Construct the query for WISPR observing small-scale eddy features
wispr_query = Fido.search(wispr_time_range, wispr_instrument, wispr_detector_inner, wispr_wavelength)

This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the study as described in the context. It uses the `sunpy.net.Fido` interface to query the VSO for data from the WISPR instrument on the Parker Solar Probe, focusing on the INNER detector and the specified white light wavelength range. The time range is precisely defined to match the observation period of the small-scale eddy features. The query results are printed, and the data download line is commented out, adhering to the directive not to execute data retrieval commands.
