## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the evolution of a quiet-Sun blowout jet observed on 2014 May 16 and its association with twin coronal mass ejections (CMEs): a jet-like CME and a bubble-like CME. The study combines multi-wavelength observations to track the filament eruption, magnetic flux cancellation, plasma blob formation due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the subsequent evolution of the jet and twin CME. The observations were conducted using data from several solar observing instruments that operate over a range of wavelengths and detector characteristics. Detailed time ranges and observational parameters are provided for each instrument, underpinning the comprehensive kinematic and morphological analysis of the event.
