## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on a search for high‚Äêenergy muon neutrinos in spatial and temporal coincidence with 784 gamma‚Äêray bursts (GRBs) using nearly 10 years of ANTARES data. It describes the methodology used to model the expected neutrino flux from GRBs in the internal shock framework (using the NeuCosmA numerical tool), the treatment of uncertainties in model parameters (redshift, minimum variability timescale, and bulk Lorentz factor), and the stacking analysis that compares the predicted GRB neutrino signal with the atmospheric background. In addition, the study discusses complementary electromagnetic observations of GRBs as provided by space‚Äêbased instruments (such as Swift, Fermi, and Konus‚ÄëWind) and ground‚Äêbased imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and it contrasts its derived neutrino flux and corresponding upper limits with those obtained by IceCube.
