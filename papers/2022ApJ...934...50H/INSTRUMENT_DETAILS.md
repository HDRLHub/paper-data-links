## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the examination of a strong magnetic cloud (MC) with a magnetic field magnitude of approximately 40 nT at 1 AU, observed during June 16-17, 2012. This MC is associated with a preexisting magnetic flux rope (MFR) identified on the Sun, and its characterization is based on quasi-three-dimensional flux rope modeling using in situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. Additionally, the study involves a correlative analysis with measurements from the Venus Express (VEX) spacecraft, which observed the same structure at a heliocentric distance of 0.7 AU. The paper aims to validate the MC modeling results and explore the spatial variation between the Wind and VEX magnetic field measurements, attributing differences to the 3D configuration of the structure. The study also compares the magnetic flux contents between the MC and the preexisting MFR, suggesting a significant reduction in axial magnetic flux due to magnetic reconnection during an M1.9 flare.

## Instrumentation Details

### Wind Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind spacecraft provided critical in situ measurements for the characterization of the magnetic cloud (MC) using a quasi-three-dimensional flux rope model. The data from Wind was essential for quantifying the contents of the magnetic flux and other parameters of the MC.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of magnetic cloud at 1 AU
- **Time Range**: June 16-17, 2012
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field and plasma measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field magnitude and components, plasma parameters
- **Additional Comments**: The measurements included magnetic field components in GSE coordinates and plasma parameters such as flow velocity, proton density, and temperature. The maximum magnetic field magnitude reached nearly 40 nT.

### Venus Express (VEX) Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - VEX provided complementary magnetic field measurements of the same magnetic cloud structure at a heliocentric distance of 0.7 AU, with an angular separation of approximately 6Â° in longitude from the Earth. These measurements were used to validate the MC modeling results obtained from the Wind spacecraft data.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of magnetic cloud at 0.7 AU
- **Time Range**: June 15-16, 2012 (approximately)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field measurements only)
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field components and magnitude
- **Additional Comments**: The data from VEX was occasionally contaminated by the Venusian magnetic field, particularly during periods of possible bow shock crossings. This aspect was considered in the analysis to ensure accurate correlation with the Wind spacecraft model predictions.
