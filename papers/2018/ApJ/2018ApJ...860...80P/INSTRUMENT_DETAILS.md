## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates twisting and swirling motions in a quiescent solar prominence observed at the north–west limb of the Sun. Using extreme ultraviolet observations from SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) in multiple wavelength channels (304 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å), the authors trace the evolution of the prominence from its formation on November 25, 2012, through its lift‐off and eruption on November 26, 2012. Detailed dynamic phases include small scale twisting in dark funnel-like structures (tornadoes) in the southern footpoint, a large-scale "roll motion" of the spine, and subsequent swirling motions after the eruption. The eruption is also associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME) whose twist and rotation were recorded by the LASCO coronagraph on board SOHO. The specific observation dates, time ranges, wavelength channels, and physical observables (e.g., rotational speeds, twist direction, and plasma motion along helical paths) are integral to constraining models of prominence instability and eruption.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is an extreme ultraviolet imaging instrument providing high-cadence (12 s) and high spatial resolution (1.5 arcsec) observations.
   - The study makes use of multiple AIA channels including 304 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å to capture different aspects of the prominence structure—its cool bright features, dark intertwined threads, and the behavior of background loops.
   - Data were processed using the standard aia_prep.pro routine and further enhanced with multi–Gaussian filtering to bring out fine structures.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “A prominence eruption was observed at the north–west limb of the Sun on 2012 November 26, by AIA (Lemen et al. 2012) on board SDO.” (Section 2, Data and Analysis)

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overall Prominence Evolution
- **Time Range**: 09:00 UT, 2012 November 25 – 22:00 UT, 2012 November 26
   - **Supporting Quote**: “We followed the evolution of the prominence from 09:00 UT, 2012 November 25 to 22:00 UT, 2012 November 26.” (Section 3.1)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily observed in AIA 171 Å (with complementary views in AIA 304 Å and 193 Å)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The prominence appeared as a dark elongated structure near the active region AR 11616, as seen in AIA 171 Å emission images...” (Section 3.1)
- **Physical Observable**: Evolution from an on-disk dark filament to a limb prominence with intertwined, spiralled threads.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The spine consisted of many intertwined and spiralled ﬁner dark threads.” (Section 3.1)
- **Additional Comments**: This long-duration observation captured the transition from a stable filament to an eruptive prominence.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Prominence Lift-off and Eruption
- **Time Range**: 09:00 UT – 16:00 UT, 2012 November 26
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Prominence lift off and the Eruption (2012 November 26; 09:00 UT – 16:00 UT).” (Section 3.2)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observed in AIA 304 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å channels
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The prominence was visible in AIA 304 Å channel as a bright structure … In hotter AIA 171 Å channel, the prominence appears as many dark winding threads...” (Section 3.2)
- **Physical Observable**: Rapid rise, continuous twisting, and the subsequent asymmetric break of the prominence spine, particularly near the southern footpoint.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “After 15:30 UT, during the fast rise, the entire southern footpoint started rotating … the prominence erupted and the prominence spine broke asymmetrically near the southern footpoint around 16:00 UT.” (Section 3.2)
- **Additional Comments**: The evolution included the disappearance and expansion of background loops, indicating a change in overlying magnetic configuration.

#### Data Collection Period 3: Small Scale Twist of the Prominence Footpoint
- **Time Range**: 11:00 UT – 15:00 UT, 2012 November 26
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Small scale twist of the prominence footpoint (2012 November 26; 11:00 UT – 15:00 UT)” (Section 3.3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Exclusively observed in AIA 171 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: “During the initial rising phase of the prominence, the twisting of individual dark funnels close to the southern footpoint is clearly seen in AIA 171 Å.” (Section 3.3)
- **Physical Observable**: Rotation and entanglement of small, dark vertical funnel-like structures (tornado-like features) observed as they slowly rise and become increasingly twisted.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Around 13:15 UT, the twist was prominent along f1 … and around 14:38 UT, apparently f1 got entangled with the adjacent funnel, f2.” (Section 3.3)
- **Additional Comments**: The small scale twist likely contributes to the overall buildup of magnetic stress leading to the eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 4: Roll Motion of the Prominence Spine
- **Time Range**: 14:30 UT – 17:00 UT, 2012 November 26
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Roll motion of the spine (2012 November 26; 14:30 UT – 17:00 UT)” (Section 3.4)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observed in AIA 304 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å channels
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The roll motion is visible in AIA 304, 171, and 193 Å channels…” (Section 3.4)
- **Physical Observable**: Large-scale twisting (roll motion) of the entire prominence indicated by the coherent, counter–clockwise rotation of both footpoints.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The counter–clockwise motions of the footpoints are seen … we concluded that northern footpoint of the prominence was also twisting counter–clockwise.” (Section 3.4)
- **Additional Comments**: This roll motion appears to be instrumental in causing the asymmetry in the eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 5: Swirling Motion Post-Eruption
- **Time Range**: Starting ~17:30 UT, 2012 November 26 (continuing into later observations)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Subsequently, around 17:30 UT, a swirling motion started close to the southern footpoint (ROI B in Figure 1d).” (Section 3.6)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Best seen in AIA 171 Å channel
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The motion is best seen in AIA 171 Å channel…” (Section 3.6)
- **Physical Observable**: Swirling plasma motion along different circular (helical) paths, with estimated plasma speeds (e.g., ∼35–60 km s⁻¹).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Bright ridges with negative (positive) slope indicate plasma movement in anti-clockwise (clockwise) direction. Corresponding to the slit location A we observed anti-clockwise motions of plasma with speed ∼35 −60 km s⁻¹…” (Section 3.6)
- **Additional Comments**: This swirling motion likely results from plasma following helical magnetic field lines formed by the earlier twist.

### 2. LASCO/C2 on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 is a coronagraph used to observe the white-light corona and detect coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
   - In this study, LASCO/C2 images were utilized to track the rotation of CME features originating from the erupting prominence.
   - The CME exhibited a pronounced rotation (often referred to as a “cartwheel” CME) with features displaying significant twist.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Finally, we observe the twist built up in the prominence, being carried away by the coronal mass ejection (CME) as seen in the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).” (Abstract and Section 4)

#### Data Collection Period 1: LASCO/C2 First Rotating Feature
- **Time Range**: 19:00 UT – 20:24 UT, 2012 November 26
   - **Supporting Quote**: “First feature appeared at 19:00 UT and disappeared after 20:24 UT…” (Section 4)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light coronagraph imaging (exact wavelengths not specified)
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implied from the use of LASCO/C2 images)
- **Physical Observable**: Rotation of a bright, extended CME feature with an estimated rotation of 150°.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The degree of rotation is 150°.” (Figure 10 caption)
- **Additional Comments**: The tracking of the feature involved fitting a circle to determine angular position over time.

#### Data Collection Period 2: LASCO/C2 Second Rotating Feature
- **Time Range**: Starting at 20:48 UT, 2012 November 26 (end time not explicitly provided)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…and the second feature appeared at 20:48 UT.” (Section 4)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light coronagraph imaging (as above, typical of LASCO/C2)
- **Physical Observable**: Rotation of another CME feature with an estimated rotation of 64°.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Degree of rotation is 64°.” (Figure 11 caption)
- **Additional Comments**: The combined rotation from both features totaled approximately 214°, which is used to infer the magnetic twist carried by the CME.
