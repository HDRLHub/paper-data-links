## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper conducts a statistical study of the magnetic imprints of X-class solar flares observed in 15 active regions since the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) until mid-2017. The primary focus is on the rapid, irreversible changes in the photospheric horizontal magnetic field (Bh) measured at and around the polarity inversion line (PIL) and sunspot penumbra, and their relation to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The observations are made using high-cadence vector magnetograms and EUV images. CME properties are obtained from SOHO observations and GOES soft X-ray data are used to delineate the flare timing. Together, these instruments allow the authors to analyze the timing (with examples showing flare stage intervals such as 00:12–01:00 UT and post‐flare stage 03:12–04:00 UT for one event) and physical parameters (horizontal field strength, inclination angle, and CME momentum) to deduce a back reaction time of approximately 70 s (with a 90% confidence interval from about 50 s to 90 s).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI is used to acquire full-disk photospheric vector magnetograms with high spatial resolution (0.5″ per pixel) and a cadence of 12 minutes. Its data, inverted from Stokes parameters taken at six wavelengths around the FeI 6173 Å line, provide the three components of the magnetic field. This instrument is central to measuring the stepwise, irreversible changes in the horizontal magnetic field (Bh) and magnetic inclination angle φ before and after solar flares.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "HMI acquires full-disk photospheric magnetograms with a pixel size of 0.5′′ at a cadence of 12 minutes." 
  - "The magnetic field is inverted from the Stokes parameters at six wavelengths distributed around the photospheric FeI 6173 Å line."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Flare Stage Observations**
  - **Time Range**: For the sample X1.8 flare in AR 12242, the flare stage is recorded from 00:12 UT to 01:00 UT.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "Panel (a) shows the difference map of Bh in flare stage (from 00:12 UT to 01:00 UT)."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Derived from observations around the photospheric FeI 6173 Å line.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetic field is inverted from the Stokes parameters at six wavelengths distributed around the photospheric FeI 6173 Å line."
  - **Physical Observable**: Horizontal magnetic field (Bh) and magnetic inclination angle (φ).
    - **Supporting Quote**: "with a focus on the rapid/irreversible change of Bh during flare time."
  - **Additional Comments**: This period is crucial for distinguishing flare-associated changes from post-flare or noise-related changes.
- **Data Collection Period 2: Post-Flare Observations**
  - **Time Range**: For the same event, the post-flare stage is observed from 03:12 UT to 04:00 UT, three hours following the flare stage.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "Panel (b) shows the difference map of Bh in post-ﬂare stage (from 03:12 UT to 04:00 UT, three hours after flare stage)."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Same as above, based on the FeI 6173 Å spectral line.
  - **Physical Observable**: Measurements of Bh help confirm that the permanent change is linked to the flare event.
  - **Additional Comments**: The selection of an equal duration interval for observing post-flare changes is used to isolate flare-associated changes from long-term evolution or noise.

### 2. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA provides full-disk Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) images with high temporal (24 s cadence) and spatial resolution. It is primarily used to trace the morphology of flare ribbons and delineate the flare region, complementing the magnetic field data provided by HMI.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "We trace the morphology of ﬂare ribbons using the AIA images at wavelength 1600 Å, with a cadence of 24 s."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Flare Ribbon Imaging**
  - **Time Range**: Images are acquired around the flare peak time. For example, in the sample event the AIA 1600 Å image is taken near the peak of the flare (exact UT not provided, but concurrent with GOES flare timing).
    - **Supporting Quote**: "In panel (d) is an AIA 1600 Å map around ﬂare peak time."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "AIA images at wavelength 1600 Å."
  - **Physical Observable**: EUV emission which highlights the structure and evolution of flare ribbons.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "to trace the morphology of ﬂare ribbons."
  - **Additional Comments**: The high-cadence images allow for detailed temporal analysis of the flare evolution, particularly in mapping the relationship spatially between the bright flare ribbons and the magnetic imprints on the photosphere.

### 3. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES instruments monitor soft X-ray flux from the Sun and are used to determine the flare classification and timing. The GOES X-ray data provide the start, peak, and stop times for each flare event, which serve as references for selecting the data intervals in the HMI and AIA observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "the recorded start and end times of GOES soft X-ray emission" as well as the detailed timing provided in Table 1 (e.g., for AR11158 on 2011.02.15: start 01:44 UT, peak 01:56 UT, stop 02:06 UT).
- **Data Collection Period 1: Flare Timing**
  - **Time Range**: For each event, specific times are given. For example, for the AR 11158 event on 2011.02.15:
    - **Start Time**: 01:44 UT
    - **Peak Time**: 01:56 UT
    - **Stop Time**: 02:06 UT
    - **Supporting Quote**: "NOAA 11158, 2011.02.15, X2.2, S21W28, 01:44 (start), 01:56 (peak), 02:06 (stop)" (see Table 1).
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-rays (typical spectral range for GOES soft X-ray measurements is around 0.1–0.8 nm; although not explicitly stated in the text, it is standard for GOES).
  - **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray flux used for classification of flare events.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “GOES X-ray classes of the sample ﬂares ranges from X1.0 to X5.4.”
  - **Additional Comments**: The GOES timing is essential for delineating the flare period during which associated changes in the photospheric magnetic field are analyzed.

### 4. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Data from the SOHO satellite are used to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The SOHO CME catalog provides CME speed and mass, which are subsequently used to calculate the CME momentum and correlate it with the change of the Lorentz force on the photosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "we estimate the CME momentum by directly multiplying the CME mass by the linear speed of the CME as observed by the SOHO satellite."
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME Observations**
  - **Time Range**: CME observation times are given for each event. For example, the AR 11158 event on 2011.02.15 has a CME time of 02:24 UT as listed in Table 2.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "NOAA 11158, 2011.02.15, X2.2, CME Time 02:24 UT" (see Table 2).
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
  - **Physical Observable**: CME speed, mass, and momentum.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME momentums are computed by multiplying the CME mass and CME speed."
  - **Additional Comments**: SOHO CME data provide critical input for assessing the relationship between CME dynamics and the magnetic imprints on the photosphere, including the estimation of the back reaction time of the flare process.
