## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the pre-eruptive coronal magnetic field configuration of NOAA active region 11504, which produced a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 14 June 2012. To analyze the build-up, formation, and eruption of a coronal flux rope, the authors directly use data from several heliophysics instruments. The research incorporates SDO/AIA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, SDO/HMI photospheric vector and line-of-sight magnetograms, Hinode/EIS coronal spectroscopy, NRH radio imaging at multiple frequencies, GOES full-disc X-ray flux, and SOHO/LASCO coronagraph images. The focus period centers on solar events between 11 and 15 June 2012, with detailed multi-wavelength and multi-instrument analysis emphasizing the hours leading to and following the CME event at approximately 13:30–14:00 UT on 14 June 2012. These observations, spanning the photosphere to the corona, form the complete basis for the physical interpretation and findings of the study.

## Instrumentation Details

### C2 Coronagraph on board SOHO/LASCO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used to identify the solar eruption (CME) and estimate plane-of-sky CME speed; establishes association between the eruption and the magnetic cloud observed in situ.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Coronagraph images were taken using the C2 coronagraph of the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph instrument (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995) to identify the solar eruption that produced the magnetic cloud. LASCO also provides an estimate of plane-of-sky CME speed soon after the eruption."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME eruption and propagation characterization
- **Time Range**: 14:12 UT on 14 June 2012 (event: CME observed leaving the Sun)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "On 14 June 2012, a halo CME was observed in LASCO C2 coronagraph images at 14:12 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible-light coronagraphic imaging
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Coronagraph images were taken using the C2 coronagraph of the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph instrument (LASCO...)"
- **Physical Observable**: White-light emission from CME structures in the corona; plane-of-sky CME speed and spatial propagation.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO also provides an estimate of plane-of-sky CME speed soon after the eruption."

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for full-disc EUV imaging in a range of coronal temperatures; primary data source for observing evolution of coronal structures, sigmoids, flare arcades, flare ribbons, and dimming regions associated with the flux rope formation and eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2012) produces full-disc EUV images at seven wavelengths with a cadence of 12 seconds and pixels that correspond to angular diameters of 0.6′′ on the Sun."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Active region, sigmoid, and eruption monitoring
- **Time Range**: 13:00 UT–14:00 UT on 14 June 2012 (pre- and post-eruption, including formation of the sigmoid and eruption)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The full-disc EUV data from 13:00 UT–14:00 UT on 14 June 2012 show that an eruption originated from NOAA active region 11504 during this time (see Section 3.3)..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple, but focus on 131 Å (and 94 Å for hot plasma; other channels as context)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The aia prep routine in SolarSoft is used to prepare the AIA data to level 1.5, correcting for the slight diﬀerence in viewing angle, focal length and alignment between each of the four AIA telescopes." and "Other AIA channels were studied, but the coronal features described in this section appear only in the 94 ˚A channel and, most prominently, the 131 ˚A channel (≈6 MK and ≈10 MK respectively; Lemen et al., 2012)."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission due to coronal plasma at different temperatures; used to track appearance of sigmoidal structures, flare ribbons, and dimmings.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "A forward-S sigmoid appears in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) data two hours before the onset of the eruption (SOL2012-06-14), which is interpreted as a signature of a right-handed ﬂux rope that formed prior to the eruption."
- **Additional Comments**: Images used for difference imaging to identify dimmings; multiple EUV channels used for full context.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for line-of-sight and vector photospheric magnetograms and continuum intensity images; allows quantitative analysis of active region magnetic evolution, sunspot dynamics, flux emergence and cancellation, and current density calculation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al., 2012) has two cameras with pixel sizes of 0.5′′. One produces line-of-sight magnetograms and white light continuum images at a cadence of 45 seconds, and the other makes vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements at an overall cadence of 12 minutes."

- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173 Å (for magnetograms and continuum)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The vector dataset used in this work is the hmi.sharp cea 720s series, which provides automatically-selected cutouts of active regions (space weather HMI active region patches; SHARPs...)."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric vector and line-of-sight magnetic fields; continuum intensity; magnetic flux, polarity, field shear, electric current.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetic ﬁeld, EUV, spectroscopic and radio observations of the active region are also presented in Section 3, and their implications are discussed in Section 4."
- **Additional Comments**: Data projections and alignment applied for accurate spatial analysis; key for identifying sunspot motion, magnetic topology, and reconnection sites.

### EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for spectroscopic analysis of coronal plasma to determine composition and Doppler velocities; quantifies FIP bias and thereby the origin of plasma in the flux rope.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Spectroscopic measurements were made using the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al., 2007) onboard Hinode. The data we use are 1′′-slit coarse (2′′) raster scans of a 120′′×512′′ ﬁeld-of-view, taking 60 second exposures at each position."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Composition and Doppler velocity measurement of flux rope plasma
- **Time Range**: Raster beginning at 11:42 UT on 14 June 2012 (samples plasma at ≈12:00 UT); event: analysis of plasma before eruption
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Composition analysis is performed using data from an EIS raster that began at 11:42 UT on 14 June 2012 to investigate whether features observed in the EUV data have photospheric or coronal plasma composition."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Si x 258.375 Å, S x 264.223 Å, Fe xii 195.12 Å, and other iron lines for DEM computation
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We follow the method of Brooks and Warren (2011), which utilizes the Fe lines to measure the electron density and compute a diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) distribution. The density and temperature are then used to model the Si x 258.375 ˚A / S x 264.223 ˚A line ratio, which is sensitive to the diﬀerence in compositional fractionation of Silicon and Sulfur due to the FIP eﬀect."
- **Physical Observable**: Elemental abundances (FIP bias) and Doppler shifts in coronal structures (loops and dimming regions); evidence for coronal vs. photospheric plasma in the forming flux rope.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "This supports our interpretation that the ﬂux rope forms in the corona. Coronal ﬂux ropes, formed via coronal reconnection, have previously been observed in other works as the appearance of diﬀuse emission structures in the hottest AIA channels above brightening ﬂare arcades..."
- **Additional Comments**: Manual alignment with AIA ensures feature matching; calibration corrections applied per standard and updated methods.
