## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on Sun-as-a-star analyses of Hα spectra for various solar active events, including flares, filament eruptions, and prominence eruptions. The primary data source is the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope / Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SMART/SDDI) at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. Observations span from 2016 to 2021, with specific events detailed in the paper. The study aims to interpret stellar data by comparing it with solar data, providing insights into the dynamics of flares and plasma on stellar surfaces.

## Instrumentation Details

### Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SDDI) on board SMART
- **General Comments**:
   - The SDDI is used to take full-disk solar images at 73 wavelengths from the Hα line center −9.0 Å to the Hα line center +9.0 Å with a time cadence of 12−16 seconds and a pixel size of 1.23 arcsec. It has been observing the Sun routinely since May 2016.
