## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the dynamical evolution of a solar filament preceding its eruption. The study focusses on the small-scale turbulent plasma motions within the filament and correlates these changes in Doppler velocity distribution and micro-turbulence with an eventual filament eruption. Multiple instruments were used to monitor the filament in various wavelengths and to capture complementary data such as coronal line intensities and magnetic field measurements. The data cover key periods around the eruption that started at approximately 03:40 UT on November 5, 2016, including observations from November 3 to November 5, 2016, for imaging instruments and follow‐up in situ measurements from November 10, 2016. These observations provide insights into the filament’s pre-eruptive activation processes and the associated coronal dynamics.

- **General Comments**:
   - The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) routinely captures full-disk images of the Sun in multiple wavelengths. It is utilized in this study to estimate coronal emission enhancements (e.g., Fe XIV and Fe XVIII emissions) as indicators of heating and reconnection processes related to the filament eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "In this study, we used a multiple-wavelengths observation of the Sun by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).

- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) provides full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms that are essential for monitoring the photospheric magnetic field.
