**produce the script**. We need to construct queries for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the K-Coronagraph (K-COR) at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These queries will focus on the specific time ranges, wavelengths, and physical observables mentioned in the context to ensure the data retrieved is relevant to the study of CME structures as described in the paper.

**Script**:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period as mentioned in the context
start_date = '2013-09-01'
end_date = '2022-11-27'

# Time range for the entire observation period
time_range = a.Time(start_date, end_date)

# AIA on SDO: Observations of hot channels and prominences
aia_instrument = a.Instrument("AIA")
aia_wavelengths = a.Wavelength(131 * u.angstrom) | a.Wavelength(304 * u.angstrom)
aia_query = Fido.search(time_range, aia_instrument, aia_wavelengths)

# K-COR at MLSO: Observations of polarization brightness in the lower corona
kcor_instrument = a.Instrument("K-COR")
kcor_wavelength = a.Wavelength(7200 * u.angstrom, 7500 * u.angstrom)
kcor_query = Fido.search(time_range, kcor_instrument, kcor_wavelength)

# LASCO on SOHO: Observations of CME structures in the outer corona
lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")
lasco_detector = a.Detector("C2")
lasco_query = Fido.search(time_range, lasco_instrument, lasco_detector)

# Display the query results
print("Query for AIA observations of hot channels and prominences:")
print(aia_query)
print("Query for K-COR observations of polarization brightness:")
print(kcor_query)
print("Query for LASCO C2 observations of CME structures in the outer corona:")
print(lasco_query)

# Uncomment the lines below to download the data
# aia_files = Fido.fetch(aia_query)
# kcor_files = Fido.fetch(kcor_query)
# lasco_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_query)
```

**Explanation**:
- **AIA on SDO**: We query for observations using the 131 Å and 304 Å wavelengths, which are used to observe hot channels and prominences, respectively. These features are proxies for magnetic flux ropes in different solar regions.
- **K-COR at MLSO**: The query retrieves data on polarization brightness (pB) in the specified wavelength range of 7200–7500 Å, which is crucial for understanding the structural evolution of CMEs in the lower corona.
- **LASCO on SOHO**: We focus on the C2 detector, which observes the outer corona, providing data on the structure of CMEs in white-light imaging.

This script is tailored to extract data specific to the study's needs, ensuring that the observations are aligned with the research objectives outlined in the paper.
