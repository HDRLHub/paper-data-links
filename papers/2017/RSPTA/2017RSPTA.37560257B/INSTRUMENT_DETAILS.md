## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of over 3,000 sungrazing and near-Sun comets discovered in coronagraph images returned by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) from its launch in December 1995 through May 31, 2016. The research focuses on direct analysis of images from the SOHO spacecraft's Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instruments, specifically the C2 and C3 telescopes, as the primary sources of data for discovery statistics, morphological characterization, and analysis of comet populations. Only comets observed in SOHO/LASCO's own images are discussed regarding rates and properties. The paper includes statistics based on direct inspection and processing of SOHO/LASCO data—namely, high-cadence images at specific filter settings over precise time intervals corresponding to nearly the entire operational lifespan of SOHO. Detailed time ranges, observation modes, physical observables (e.g., cometary appearance, morphology, and brightness), and cadence changes are integral to the paper's findings and are reported in detail.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The LASCO coronagraph suite (C2 and C3) was the primary and essentially exclusive data source for the analysis, discovery statistics, and morphological study of over 3,000 comets presented in this paper. LASCO images, processed in real-time and archival searches, form the entirety of the main comet census and all subsequent statistical and morphological analyses.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Comets are discovered and observed primarily by LASCO, which itself is a suite of three coronagraph telescopes – C1, C2, and C3 – designed to observe the solar corona from a distance of 1.1–30 R⊙(1 R⊙= 1 solar radius = 0.00465 AU) in the plane of the sky (Brueckner et al. 1995)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SOHO/LASCO mission data for sungrazing/near-Sun comet discovery and analysis—January 1996 to May 31, 2016
- **Time Range**: January 1996 – May 31, 2016 (routine LASCO operations)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO began recording images in January 1996, but the instrument was not commissioned until April of that year... As of May 31, 2016, 3,138 new comet discoveries are credited to SOHO."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "...more than 3,000 sungrazing and near-Sun comets discovered in coronagraph images returned by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), since its launch in December 1995."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Images from C2 primarily in Orange (540–640 nm), C3 primarily in Clear (400–850 nm), with additional mention of Blue (420–520 nm), H-alpha (655–657 nm), Deep Red (730–835 nm), and Infrared (860–1050 nm) filters—though the vast majority of data is Orange (C2) and Clear (C3).
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Nominally, C2 images are recorded using a combination of Orange filter and Clear polarizer, the specifications of which are detailed in Table 1... the majority of C2 images are recorded with the Orange-Clear filter combination, with the H-alpha and Infrared filters having been used very rarely throughout the mission."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Nominally, C3 images are recorded using a combination of Clear filter and Clear polarizer, the specifications of which are detailed in Table 1, though the instrument has available the same filters as C2. ... the majority of C3 images are recorded with the Clear-Clear filter combination."
- **Physical Observable**: Visible light images of the solar corona in which sungrazing and near-Sun comets are detected; observables include cometary brightness, morphology (stellar/tailed/diffuse), survival or destruction near perihelion, and detailed discovery statistics.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "With word slowly reaching the broader astronomical community, amateur astronomers not affiliated with the SOHO mission began to take advantage of SOHO data posted publicly to the Internet, and began reporting comets in archive data previously overlooked by scientists. By 2000, approximately two hundred comets had been detected in SOHO’s LASCO imagery."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The Kreutz lightcurves are unusual in that they generally peak in brightness at 10–15 R⊙and fade interior to this, with an occasional second peak inside of ∼8 R⊙ (Biesecker et al. 2002; Knight et al. 2010). The comets eventually disappear, often significantly before perihelion, and none of the SOHO-observed Kreutz have been observed to survive perihelion except C/2011 W3 Lovejoy. This behavior is interpreted as the total destruction and vaporization of the comet and has been used to estimate initial sizes of less than ∼100 m in diameter (Iseli et al. 2002; Sekanina 2003; Knight et al. 2010)."
- **Additional Comments**: Changes in observing cadence and operational status are documented and analyzed as part of the discovery statistics and rate analysis.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Prior to 2010, C2 nominally returned three full-resolution images per hour, with that rate increasing to five per hour after 2010. ... In 2010, the SOHO mission underwent a significant programmatic shift... As of August 3, 2010, both LASCO C3 and C2 cameras were increased to a nominal 12-minute cadence, with on-board recording of data through all major DSN gaps."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Table 3 shows the number of 'useful' images returned by the LASCO C2 and C3 per year for 1996 through 2015, along with discovery rates for Kreutz and Meyer group comets for every 1,000 such images recorded."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Discovery rates see significant impacts from the rate of data returned by LASCO, and seasonal effects resulting from the viewing geometry of the spacecraft."

#### Data Collection Period 2: LASCO C2 (Orange-Clear) and C3 (Clear-Clear) Mode—2010 to May 31, 2016 (high-cadence extended mission phase)
- **Time Range**: August 3, 2010 – May 31, 2016 (high cadence period)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "As of August 3, 2010, both LASCO C3 and C2 cameras were increased to a nominal 12-minute cadence, with on-board recording of data through all major DSN gaps."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Same as above; emphasis on C2 Orange (540–640 nm)/Clear and C3 Clear (400–850 nm)/Clear modes.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Table 1... Orange: C2, 540–640 nm, 1024×1024... Clear: C3, 400–850 nm, 1024×1024..."
- **Physical Observable**: Improved detection efficiency—detection of fainter Kreutz comets, with discussion of observational thresholds and completeness.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Over the past 19 years, the LASCO instrument has observed approximately three new Kreutz comets for every one thousand images returned by the instrument. 1998 shows the highest annual rate, with almost five per one thousand images... Of particular note in Figure 6 is the apparent fall in normalized discovery rates since 2010, despite a large increase in the total number of comets discovered during this period (Figure 1)."
- **Additional Comments**: Change in LASCO data rate is directly linked to enhanced comet discovery statistics, affecting completeness estimates and rate analysis.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The increased data rate has seen a corresponding jump in the detection rates of SOHO comets, with approximately fifty more comets per year discovered during the extended phase. Primarily, the number of Kreutz-group comets detected in LASCO C2 comprise the bulk of these new discoveries."

### [No direct SOHO data from other instruments (SWAN, UVCS) used in the main analysis]
- **General Comments**: Comets observed by SOHO’s Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrograph (UVCS) and the all-sky Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) Lyman-alpha imager are explicitly excluded from this paper’s analysis scope.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We note briefly that several comets have been observed by SOHO’s Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrograph (UVCS) ..., and that comets are routinely observed and occasionally discovered in its all-sky Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) Lyman-alpha imager ... However, these observations and detections are beyond the scope of this paper."

### [All other instruments only mentioned in literature review or for comparative context—excluded by instructions]
- **General Comments**: No data from non-SOHO/LASCO instruments (in literature or historical/ground-based context) are used in this paper’s direct analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We note briefly that several comets have been observed by SOHO’s Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrograph (UVCS) (e.g., Raymond et al. 1998, Bemporad et al. 2007), and that comets are routinely observed and occasionally discovered in its all-sky Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) Lyman-alpha imager (e.g., Bertaux et al. 1997, Combi et al. 2014). However, these observations and detections are beyond the scope of this paper."
