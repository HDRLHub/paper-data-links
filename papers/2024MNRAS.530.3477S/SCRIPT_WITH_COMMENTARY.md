```

**Explanation**:
- The script constructs a query for the VIRGO instrument on SOHO using the SunPy library. The query specifies a time range from 1996 to 2013, covering a broad operational period.
- The wavelengths specified are based on the details provided in the context, which mentions VIRGO's three channels.
- The `Fido.search` function is used to search for data matching the specified criteria. The results are printed, and the actual data download command is commented out as per the directive.
- This script reflects the data used in the context and adheres strictly to the provided details. It is designed to be clear, explicit, and avoids complex structures for easy understanding and modification.
