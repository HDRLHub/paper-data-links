## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the complexity of solar flares by analyzing their spatial and temporal distributions over the solar surface using network theory. The study specifically utilizes a dataset of 14,395 solar flares with recorded occurrence times, locations (latitude and longitude), and GOES X-ray classification, collected from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016. The primary data used for this research were obtained from the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL) and associated platforms, with supplementary rotation corrections applied using SunPy software. This dataset forms the basis for constructing, characterizing, and analyzing the solar flare complex network, and all results presented are directly derived from this observational dataset.

## Instrumentation Details

### Solar Flare Event Lists from LMSAL (Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory) / SolarSoft Latest Events Archive
- **General Comments**:
  - The main observational data source used in this research is the comprehensive event list of solar flares (including positions, times, and classifications) produced by space-based X-ray monitoring (primarily the GOES spacecraft) and compiled in the LMSAL SolarSoft/Latest Events database.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "We used the information of the 14395 solar ﬂares taken from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 which is available at http : //www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest events archive.html."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Solar Flare Sample Used for Network Construction
- **Time Range**: 2006-01-01 – 2016-07-21 (entire analysis and event context for network construction)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Both the occurrence time and the location of ﬂares detected from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 are used to design the growing ﬂares network."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray flux, as provided by the source GOES monitoring (for classification: X, M, C, B, A)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The ﬂare information consists of an event number, EName (e.g., gev 20101114 1020), ﬂares start, stop, and peak times, X-ray (GOES) classiﬁcation (X, M, C, B, and A), event type, and position on the Sun (Table 1)."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar flare occurrence time, location (latitude and longitude), and GOES X-ray class
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The occurrence (start) times, classiﬁcation types, and locations (latitude and longitude) of ﬂares on the Sun are used to construct the network."
- **Additional Comments**: The dataset was processed for positional consistency, with rotation to a reference epoch using SunPy software, and bad/incomplete data were excluded.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Bad data (e.g., wrong information about locations) is removed from the analysis. Using the diﬀrot function in the SunPy software, the location (longitude) of the ﬂares is rotated with respect to January 1, 2006 (the occurrence time of the ﬁrst ﬂare in our data set)."

### GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) [implicit via event list]
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES is the primary observatory for solar X-ray data in the event lists used, with classifications based on its measurements forming an integral part of the dataset's physical observables.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The ﬂare information consists of an event number, EName (e.g., gev 20101114 1020), ﬂares start, stop, and peak times, X-ray (GOES) classiﬁcation (X, M, C, B, and A), event type, and position on the Sun (Table 1)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: All events classified and timed using GOES X-ray observations
- **Time Range**: 2006-01-01 – 2016-07-21 (as governed by the event list and classification context)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We used the information of the 14395 solar ﬂares taken from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 which is available at http : //www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest events archive.html."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å soft X-ray band (corresponding to GOES X-ray class system)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "X-ray (GOES) classiﬁcation (X, M, C, B, and A)"
- **Physical Observable**: Peak soft X-ray flux, event timing, flare location for flare network analysis
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The occurrence (start) times, classiﬁcation types, and locations (latitude and longitude) of ﬂares on the Sun are used to construct the network."
- **Additional Comments**: Only events with valid positional and timing information were retained after quality screening and reference frame adjustment.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Bad data (e.g., wrong information about locations) is removed from the analysis."

**Note:** No additional instruments or sensors are described as providing directly analyzed data for this research; all primary observational input derives from the summary flare catalogs as detailed above. The study does not incorporate ancillary imagery, magnetograms, or other physical diagnostics in its network analysis.
