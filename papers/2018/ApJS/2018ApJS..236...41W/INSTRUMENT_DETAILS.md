## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive, long‐duration (∼10 years) statistical study of the solar wind near 1 AU by comparing temperature parameters, plasma betas, and temperature ratios for electrons, protons, and alpha-particles. The analysis relies on high-cadence, calibrated in-situ measurements provided by the Wind spacecraft over the period from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 2005. A variety of onboard instruments are used to extract key plasma properties – including ion moments, electron distributions, and magnetic field vectors – which serve as an essential baseline for understanding solar wind behavior, validating theoretical models, and guiding future missions such as Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Wind/SWE Faraday Cups on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - The SWE Faraday Cups (FCs) provide measurements of the proton and alpha-particle densities and temperatures. They are used to obtain ion velocity moments by fitting bi-Maxwellian distributions to the observed data.
   - This instrument is critical for capturing the ion component of the solar wind using a relatively high temporal cadence.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The proton and alpha-particle densities (ns) and temperatures (T s,j) were taken from the Wind/SWE Faraday Cups (FCs) (Ogilvie et al. 1995) at a ∼92 second cadence covering an energy-per-charge range of ∼150–8000 eV/C."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Continuous Ion Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: January 1, 1995 00:00:33.565 UTC to January 1, 2005 00:00:33.565 UTC
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Prior to computing any quantity or ratio, we constructed a uniform grid of two minute intervals spanning from January 1, 1995 00:00:33.565 UTC to January 1, 2005 00:00:33.565 UTC."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; instead, the instrument covers an energy-per-charge range of ∼150–8000 eV/C.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "covering an energy-per-charge range of ∼150–8000 eV/C."
   - **Physical Observable**: Ion temperatures and densities (for protons and alpha-particles), which are derived from velocity moments using nonlinear least-squares fits of bi-Maxwellians.
- **Additional Comments**: The variable energy (speed) resolution (∼6.5–13% or ∼3.3–6.5% depending on the energy window) is accounted for in the analysis, ensuring precise characterization of the ion populations.

### 2. Wind/3DP Electron Electrostatic Analyzers (EESA Low and EESA High) on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind/3DP suite includes electron electrostatic analyzers which merge data from the EESA Low and EESA High detectors. This combination allows for the comprehensive measurement of electron velocity distributions over a wide dynamic range.
   - These measurements are used to determine electron densities and temperatures with cadences of approximately 45 or 78 seconds.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The electron densities (ne) and temperatures (T e,j, where j = tot, ∥, or ⊥) were taken from the Wind/3DP electron electrostatic analyzers (Lin et al. 1995) with a ∼45 or ∼78 second cadence and constant energy bin width of ∼20%."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Continuous Electron Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: January 1, 1995 00:00:33.565 UTC to January 1, 2005 00:00:33.565 UTC
      - **Supporting Quote**: As above, the uniform two-minute grid applies for constructing the long-duration dataset.
   - **Wavelength(s)/Energy Channels**: Not expressed as wavelengths but in energy terms; the lowest energy channel setting is approximately 3 eV (commonly set to ∼5 eV) with a constant energy bin width of ∼20%.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "the lowest energy channel setting is ∼3 eV (more commonly the instrument is set to Emin ∼5 eV)."
   - **Physical Observable**: Electron velocity distributions, from which total electron densities and scalar temperatures are derived.
- **Additional Comments**: Corrections for spacecraft floating potential are applied to these measurements to ensure that the electron moments are accurately computed.

### 3. Wind/MFI Dual Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometers on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind/MFI instrument provides measurements of the solar wind’s quasi-static magnetic field vectors using dual, triaxial fluxgate magnetometers.
   - These data are essential for determining the orientation (parallel and perpendicular components) of the plasma parameters.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Quasi-static magnetic field vectors (B o) were taken from the Wind/MFI dual, triaxial fluxgate magnetometers (Lepping et al. 1995) using the one minute cadence data."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic Field Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Consistent with the overall mission data, January 1, 1995 00:00:33.565 UTC to January 1, 2005 00:00:33.565 UTC
      - **Supporting Quote**: The uniform time grid utilized for the study implies this same period.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Physical Observable**: The magnetic field vector (B o) which is used to define the parallel (∥) and perpendicular (⊥) directions in plasma parameter analysis.
- **Additional Comments**: The one minute cadence ensures that rapid variations in the magnetic field are captured, helping in subsequential categorization of the plasma data.

### 4. Wind/WAVES/TNR Instrument on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - The WAVES/TNR instrument is utilized to observe the upper hybrid line (also called the plasma line) via quasi-thermal noise spectroscopy.
   - This measurement allows for an unambiguous determination of the total electron density (ne) independent of spacecraft potential effects.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Wind can unambiguously measure the total electron density by observing the upper hybrid line (also called the plasma line) with the WAVES/TNR instrument (Bougeret et al. 1995). Analysis of the upper hybrid line via the technique of quasi-thermal noise spectroscopy yield an accurate measurement of ne unaffected by spacecraft potential."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Upper Hybrid Line Observations**
   - **Time Range**: January 1, 1995 00:00:33.565 UTC to January 1, 2005 00:00:33.565 UTC
      - **Supporting Quote**: The same uniform grid is applied for all instruments in the study.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: This instrument targets radio frequency emissions corresponding to the plasma upper hybrid line rather than a specific wavelength band.
   - **Physical Observable**: The primary observable is the total electron density measured through quasi-thermal noise spectroscopy.
- **Additional Comments**: This instrument’s measurements are used to validate and refine the spacecraft potential corrections applied to the electron moments derived from the 3DP electron analyzers.
