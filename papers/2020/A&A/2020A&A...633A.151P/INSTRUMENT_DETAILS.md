## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper develops and tests a method—named the Core Field Fit Estimator (CoFFE)—to correct the effect of magnetic tongues on the tilt angle measurement of emerging bipolar active regions (ARs). The study initially uses a synthetic flux rope (FR) model to generate simulated line‐of‐sight magnetograms representing the emergence process and then applies the method to real observations. The observational data are sourced from full-disc LOS magnetograms that capture the magnetic flux distribution on the photosphere. These observations are crucial to distinguish between the apparent tilt (affected by the magnetic tongue contribution) and a corrected tilt that more closely traces the intrinsic tilt of the emerging flux rope. The paper discusses both synthetic data from the model and real observational magnetograms obtained with a well‐known instrument, and it compares time evolution across several AR emergence episodes over specific date ranges.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is used to obtain full-disc line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms that record the photospheric magnetic field.  
   - It provides digital measurements of the magnetic flux distribution at a spatial resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with a resolution of 1.98′′ per pixel.
   - Magnetograms are produced at a 96-minute cadence by averaging one-minute or five-minute measurements, with associated flux density errors of approximately 16 G and 9 G per pixel respectively.
   - These observations serve as the primary data source used to test and validate the CoFFE method in removing the magnetic tongue effect from tilt-angle estimations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "We applied CoFFE to LOS magnetograms of ARs obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The full-disc magnetograms with 96-minute cadence are obtained by averaging either one-minute and five-minute magnetograms."

#### Data Collection Period 1: AR 9574
- **Time Range**: 10 August 2001 – 13 August 2001  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "AR 9574 emerged between 10 and 13 August 2001. The time span for this AR encompasses 55 magnetograms..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - While the specific wavelength is not explicitly mentioned in the text, the MDI typically observes the photospheric magnetic field (commonly using the Ni I 6768 Å line).
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     (Implied from the usage of “LOS magnetograms” and the reference to MDI’s standard operating mode.)
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Photospheric magnetic flux measured in Gauss, with particular attention to the Bz (vertical field) component.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "The red- and blue-shaded areas represent the positive and the negative Bz magnetic field component... The magenta isocontours correspond to |Bz| = 50 G."

#### Data Collection Period 2: AR 10268
- **Time Range**: Approximately 21 January 2003 – (5-day evolution; inferred until ~26 January 2003)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "AR 10268 emerged in the north hemisphere (N12) around midday of 21 January 2003. The 5-day long evolution of the AR is only limited by the longitudinal criterion..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - As above, the instrument observes photospheric magnetic fields via LOS magnetograms (typically the Ni I line is used).
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     (Same implication as for AR 9574.)
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Magnetic flux density (Bz) and the temporal evolution of the flux distribution are analyzed.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "Figure 8a shows four magnetograms of the emergence phase of AR 10268..."  

#### Data Collection Period 3: AR 9748
- **Time Range**: 21 December 2001 – 24 December 2001  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "AR 9748 emerged in the southern hemisphere (S11) and close to the east limb on 21 December 2001. We analyse its five-day long evolution across the solar disc..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - Observations are made in the same context, capturing the LOS magnetic field.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     (Inferred from repeated descriptions of “Bz” in the magnetograms.)
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - The LOS magnetic flux distribution; the measurements focus on the identification of polarity barycentres and the separation of core fields from tongue fields.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "The black circular contours are the half-width level of the Gaussian fit for each polarity... The green and blue contours indicate the areas where the field differs significantly from the fitted Gaussian."

#### Data Collection Period 4: AR 9906
- **Time Range**: 12 April 2002 – 17 April 2002  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "AR 9906... the temporal interval covers five days between 12 and 17 April 2002."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - As with the other observations, the instrument captures the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     (Inferred from the magnetogram descriptions and the standard operating mode of MDI.)
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - The measured vertical component (Bz) of the magnetic field, which is used to determine both the apparent and corrected tilt angles of the AR “bipole.”
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "Figure 10a shows selected magnetograms of the emergence phase of AR 9906... The green contours are well delimiting the magnetic tongues, and the black segments show the tilt of the AR computed from the core field centers."
