# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## 1. SECCHI-Extreme UV Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument was used to observe the onset of the Earth‐directed prominence eruption that initiated CME1. EUVI delivers extreme ultraviolet images sensitive to coronal plasma.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The source of the ﬁrst CME (hereafter CME1) was an Earth-directed small prominence eruption seen on the western limb of the Sun by SECCHI-Extreme UV Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004) on board the STEREO-B spacecraft."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the eruptive prominence**
        - **Time Range**: 21 September 2009, from 16:36 UT (when the image was taken) to 19:37 UT (when the prominence exited the EUVI field of view)
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - From the image caption: "Fig. 1: Image from STEREO-B EUVI (304Å) of the erupting prominence, taken on 21 September 2009 at 16:36UT." And in the text: "the prominence departed ... and exited the EUVI ﬁeld of view at 19:37 UT on 21 Sept 2009."
        - **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "Image from STEREO-B EUVI (304Å) ..."
        - **Physical Observable**: Erupting prominence in the low corona prior to CME1.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "The source of the ﬁrst CME ... was an Earth-directed small prominence eruption..."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The EUVI observations provided the initial timing and morphology of the prominence eruption that later underwent propagation as CME1.

## 2. COR1-B Coronagraph on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
   - The COR1-B coronagraph is used to image the outer corona in white light to track coronal mass ejections. In this study, it provided the observation of CME2.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Almost 8 hours after CME1, on 22 Sept 2009 at ∼04:05 UT, a second eruption (hereafter CME2) appeared in the COR1-B (Thompson et al. 2003; Howard et al. 2008) coronagraph ﬁeld of view at a height of ≈2RS."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Detection of the second CME (CME2)**
        - **Time Range**: 22 September 2009, approximately at 04:05 UT  
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "on 22 Sept 2009 at ∼04:05 UT, a second eruption ... appeared in the COR1-B coronagraph ﬁeld of view..."
        - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated, but as a coronagraph it images in white light.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - Instrument details are provided via the citation (Thompson et al. 2003; Howard et al. 2008) which imply standard white-light coronagraphic imaging.
        - **Physical Observable**: The appearance and structure of a second, stealth or weak CME at a height of ≈2 solar radii.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "a second eruption (hereafter CME2) ... appeared in the COR1-B coronagraph ﬁeld of view at a height of ≈2RS."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - This observation is important for distinguishing between the first clearly initiated CME and the subsequent stealth-like eruption.

## 3. MESSENGER Magnetometer on board MESSENGER
- **General Comments**:
   - The onboard magnetometer of the MESSENGER spacecraft was used to obtain in situ magnetic field measurements en route to Mercury. Its data was crucial for comparing simulated interplanetary signatures of the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "On 23 Sept 2009 (when the CME arrived at Mercury), the MESSENGER spacecraft was at an angle of only ≈11◦ westward from the Sun–Earth line at a distance of ≈75 R⊙ from the Sun and not in Mercury’s magnetosphere. This makes the onboard Magnetometer (Anderson et al. 2007) instrument ideal for in situ magnetic ﬁeld data comparison with our simulations."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: In situ observation of CME arrival near Mercury**
        - **Time Range**: 23 September 2009 (exact UT not explicitly provided)
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "On 23 Sept 2009 (when the CME arrived at Mercury) ..."
        - **Detector / Observable**: In situ magnetic field measurement including total magnetic field jump and smooth rotation of the Bz component.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "find a clear jump in total magnetic ﬁeld, as well as a smooth rotation of the Bz component in MESSENGER data."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The magnetometer data provided a key comparison point for validating the simulated interplanetary magnetic signatures.

## 4. SWOOPS Instrument on board Ulysses
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun (SWOOPS) instrument on Ulysses is mentioned as a reference for the fast solar wind observed at high latitudes.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The bimodality is expressed as a function of latitude, with faster solar wind at high latitudes, consistent with the data obtained by the Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun (SWOOPS, Bame et al. 1992) instrument on board Ulysses spacecraft (McComas et al. 1998)..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: High-latitude solar wind measurements**
        - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the text.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - The text does not specify exact dates; it only states consistency with SWOOPS data.
        - **Detector / Observable**: Solar wind speed at high latitudes.
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "with faster solar wind at high latitudes..."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although no specific time range is given, the SWOOPS measurements serve as a benchmark for simulating the bimodal nature of the solar wind in both slow and faster wind scenarios.

## 5. WIND and ACE Instruments through the OMNI Database (In situ observations at Earth)
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI database aggregates in situ solar wind measurements from instruments on the WIND and ACE spacecraft. These data are used to compare simulated parameters (such as magnetic field components, dynamic pressure, and speed) at 1 AU with actual observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The in situ values at Earth (L1) were taken from the OMNI database, which combines data measured by the WIND (Ogilvie et al. 1995; Lepping et al. 1995) and ACE (Stone et al. 1998) spacecraft to provide near-continuous solar wind observations."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: In situ solar wind observations at Earth**
        - **Time Range**: Approximately from 25 September 2009 00:00 UT to 01 October 2009 00:00 UT
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - In Fig. 2, the time axis is labeled from "25/09/09 00:00" to "01/10/09 00:00" and later in Fig. 8 the dates on the x-axis are noted as from 2009.
        - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (these instruments measure plasma and field parameters rather than electromagnetic wavelengths).
        - **Physical Observable**: In situ parameters such as total magnetic field, dynamic pressure, solar wind speed, temperature, and the various magnetic field components (Bz, By).
           - **Supporting Quote**:
              - "The simulated magnetic ﬁeld components are compared with data from the OMNI database" and "in situ measured components of the magnetic ﬁeld taken by MESSENGER... and simulation data... taken at 1 AU."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The WIND and ACE combined observations offer comprehensive real-time solar wind data while the OMNI database provides averaged data (with 5 min cadence averaged over 20 minutes) to match the simulation outputs.
