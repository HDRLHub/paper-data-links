## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a data-driven, physics-based model for predicting radiation hazards from solar energetic particles (SEPs) accelerated by coronal mass ejection (CME) shocks. The model calculates the injection, acceleration, and propagation of SEPs as they travel through the solar corona and interplanetary magnetic fields. It utilizes input from coronal and heliospheric plasma and magnetic field configurations derived from an MHD model driven by solar photospheric magnetic field measurements, combined with observed CME shocks from coronagraph images. The model applies advanced computational techniques to solve the time-dependent 5-dimensional focus transport equation in phase space, which includes mechanisms like pitch-angle scattering, diffusion across magnetic field lines, and particle acceleration by CME shocks. The study focuses on the 2011 November 3 CME event, demonstrating that the model can reproduce multi-spacecraft SEP observations without normalization of particle flux, suggesting that SEPs observed at widely separated longitudes can be explained by diffusive shock acceleration by a single moderate-speed CME shock.

## Instrumentation Details

### Coronagraphs on board Various Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - Coronagraphs are used to observe and determine the characteristics of CMEs, including their size, speed, and propagation through the corona. These instruments capture images of the corona by blocking the bright light from the solar disk, allowing the fainter corona to be visible. The data from coronagraphs are crucial for tracking CME shocks and modeling their interactions with the solar wind.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of CME shocks
- **Time Range**: Specific dates and times are not mentioned for the observations within the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified, typically visible light and near-infrared.
- **Physical Observable**: CME shocks, their propagation, and characteristics such as speed and size.
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from coronagraphs are integrated into the MHD model to provide realistic boundary conditions for simulating SEP events.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imagers on the Ground and in Space
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments measure the solar photospheric magnetic field, providing essential data for constructing coronal magnetic field models. These measurements are a critical input for the MHD models used in the study.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement of solar photospheric magnetic fields
- **Time Range**: Specific dates and times are not mentioned for the observations within the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified, typically in the optical spectrum.
- **Physical Observable**: Solar photospheric magnetic field.
- **Additional Comments**: Data from these imagers are used to drive the MHD models that simulate the plasma and magnetic field environments through which CMEs propagate.

### MAS/CORHEL MHD Models
- **General Comments**:
   - The MAS (Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere) and CORHEL (Corona-Heliosphere) models are computational tools used to simulate the solar corona and heliosphere's magnetic and plasma environments. These models are driven by magnetic field measurements and are essential for understanding the conditions through which SEPs propagate.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Simulation of plasma and magnetic fields
- **Time Range**: The models are run for the period covering the 2011 November 3 CME event.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (theoretical models).
- **Physical Observable**: Plasma and magnetic field configurations.
- **Additional Comments**: These models provide the environmental conditions used in the SEP transport model, integrating observational data to enhance prediction accuracy.
