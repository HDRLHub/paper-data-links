produce the script. We need to construct a query using the SunPy library to access data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO). The context provided focuses on solar flux measurements from the SOHO/SUMER instrument, which is relevant to the study's energy deposition model. We will create a query for the SOHO/SUMER instrument, considering its availability in the VSO interface. The time range for the solar flux measurements is specified as various dates in 1997 and 2008, but we will focus on the available time range for SOHO/SUMER in the VSO, which is from 1996/01/22 to 2017/04/04. The wavelength range for SUMER is 67 to 152 nm, which corresponds to 670 to 1520 Angstroms. We will construct a query for this instrument and time range, and print the results.
