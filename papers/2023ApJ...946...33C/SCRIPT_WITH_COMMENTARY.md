```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period as mentioned in the context
observation_date = '2017-07-15'
start_time = '10:17:00'
end_time = '11:39:00'

# Define the frequency range for the observations
frequency_start = 30 * u.MHz
frequency_end = 70 * u.MHz

# Time range for the observations
time_range = a.Time(f'{observation_date}T{start_time}', f'{observation_date}T{end_time}')

# Assuming LOFAR is available in the VSO interface for this educational example
# If LOFAR is not available through Fido, this script serves as a conceptual demonstration
lofar_instrument = a.Instrument('LOFAR')

# Construct the query for the specified time range and frequency
query = Fido.search(time_range, lofar_instrument, a.Wavelength(frequency_start, frequency_end))

# Display the query results
print("Query for LOFAR observations of solar radio spikes and Type IIIb striae:")
print(query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script sets up a query for LOFAR data covering the specific event and time range mentioned in the context. It assumes access to LOFAR data through SunPy's Fido interface, which might not reflect real-world availability. The script is designed to be clear and straightforward, focusing on the specific requirements provided in the context.
