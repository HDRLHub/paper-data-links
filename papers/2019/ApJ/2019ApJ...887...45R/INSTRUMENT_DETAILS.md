## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study uses observations of sungrazing comets to probe the solar corona and its physical conditions. By analyzing the intensity and velocity profiles of the HI Lyα line, the authors explore the dynamics of different “generations” of neutral hydrogen produced in the cometary environment. The paper combines numerical simulations with comparisons to previous UV spectroscopic observations of Comet C/2002 S2 to investigate how first-, second-, and third-generation neutrals trace coronal density, temperature, and solar wind speed. Key datasets originate from space‐based instruments such as UVCS and LASCO on SOHO, the AIA instrument on SDO, and upcoming observations by the Metis coronagraph on Solar Orbiter. Specific observing time ranges for UVCS at different heliocentric distances are used to constrain the integrated intensities and Doppler shifts, while complementary imaging (LASCO, AIA) and planned Lyα imaging (Metis) provide contextual and future data elements.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - UVCS is used to observe and analyze the HI Lyα emission from sungrazing comets. The instrument recorded both intensity maps and Doppler velocity images, which serve as key diagnostics for determining coronal density, temperature, and solar wind speed. Its observations focus on resolving the structure of various neutral hydrogen populations (first-, second-, and third-generation) in comet C/2002 S2.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of Comet C/2002 S2 at 6 R⊙
- **Time Range**: 23:17 UT until 00:16 UT on 18/19 September 2002  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "UVCS observed comet C/2002 S2 at 6 R⊙ from 23:17 until 00:16 UT on 18/19 September, 2002."
- **Wavelength(s)**: HI Lyα  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "UVCS observations of the intensities and line profiles of H I Lyα trace the density, temperature and outﬂow speed of the corona."
- **Physical Observable**: Lyα intensity and velocity centroids (Doppler shifts) that reveal the spatial structure and dynamics of the neutral hydrogen populations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The split tail observed at 8 R⊙ and the asymmetric pattern of red-shift to the south and blue-shift to the north…"

#### Data Collection Period 2: Observation of Comet C/2002 S2 at 8 R⊙
- **Time Range**: 21:31 UT until 22:22 UT on 18 September 2002  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "UVCS observed the comet at 8 R⊙ from 21:31 until 22:22 UT on 18 September, 2002."
- **Wavelength(s)**: HI Lyα  
   - **Supporting Quote**: As above regarding the use of HI Lyα for tracing coronal plasma properties.
- **Physical Observable**: Spatially resolved Lyα emission displaying a split tail morphology and different Doppler shifts on either side of the tail.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The blue-shifted northern side is very faint… while the red-shifted 3rd generation emission lies to the south."
- **Additional Comments**: These two time periods are used to compare variations in brightness and line centroid shifts, thereby informing the modeling of different neutral populations.

### 2. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is primarily referenced as the instrument that discovered the majority of Kreutz sungrazers. It provides context for the occurrence of these comets by capturing wide-field coronagraph images.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "More than 3000 Kreutz sungrazers have been discovered, mostly by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the SOHO satellite."
- **Data Collection Context**:
   - Although not used directly for the Lyα analysis, LASCO C2 difference images are referenced as they recorded a 450 km s⁻¹ west limb CME, offering insight into the ambient coronal conditions.
   - **Time Noted**: A CME was observed at 08:30 UT.
       - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO C2 difference images show a 450 km s⁻¹ west limb CME at 08:30 UT…"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (broad-band coronagraph images, typical for LASCO instruments)
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of sungrazers and coronal mass ejections (CME speeds and morphology).
  
### 3. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA instrument is mentioned with respect to its utility in observing large sungrazing comets (e.g., Comet C/2011 N3 and Comet C/2011 W3 “Lovejoy”). It has been used to infer coronal densities and magnetic field directions.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Observations of two large sungrazers, C/2011 N3 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), by the AIA instrument on SDO, have been used to infer coronal densities and magnetic ﬁeld directions."
- **Time Range**: No explicit time ranges are provided in the context.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme ultraviolet; for example, AIA 171 Å images are referenced.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...as indicated by motion of the striations seen in AIA 171 Å images after the comet’s passage."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal densities and magnetic field structures inferred from the observed EUV images.

### 4. Metis Coronagraph on board Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
   - The Metis coronagraph is mentioned as an upcoming instrument that will provide Lyα images of comets and contribute to the derivation of key solar wind parameters. Its role is expected to complement past UVCS observations by offering additional spatial and temporal detail in Lyα.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "…and sungrazing comet observations with the Metis coronagraph."
   - Later, "The Metis instrument on the Solar Orbiter spacecraft will provide Lyα images of comets…"
- **Time Range**: No specific observation time ranges are provided in the context.
- **Wavelength(s)**: HI Lyα (implied by its purpose to provide Lyα images)
- **Physical Observable**: Lyα intensity images that can be used to derive coronal density, temperature, and solar wind outflow speed.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…have discussed how those images can be used to derive the density, temperature and outflow speed of the solar wind."
