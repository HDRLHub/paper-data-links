## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes the optical path difference (OPD) noise induced by space plasma on the laser propagation used for gravitational wave (GW) detection in the TianQin (TQ) mission. It employs global magnetosphere magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to study how the electron number density distribution along laser links affects the precision measurement of optical path lengths, which must reach accuracies near 10⁻¹² m. The work not only discusses TQ’s laser interferometry (using a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm) and its associated data combinations (single link, Michelson, and time delay interferometry (TDI) combinations α and X) but also uses real-time solar wind data as simulation inputs. The paper places TQ in context with other GW observatory instruments—both ground-based and space-borne—and discusses complementary dual-frequency techniques for measuring the total electron content (TEC) relevant for mitigating plasma dispersion effects.
