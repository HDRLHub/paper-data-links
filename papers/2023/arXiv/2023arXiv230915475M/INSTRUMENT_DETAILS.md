## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the effects of coronal mass ejection (CME) orientation on its propagation in the heliosphere, focusing on how differently oriented interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) interact with the ambient plasma and interplanetary magnetic field. The study spans from 1997 to 2018, examining 31 CME-ICME pairs using data from SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs and in situ measurements from spacecraft like WIND and ACE. The research aims to understand the influence of CME orientation on parameters such as nonradial flows, shock orientation, and the overall drag force experienced by ICMEs during their transit to Earth.

## Instrumentation Details

### SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs were used to determine the orientation of CMEs in the near-Sun environment through an ellipse-fitting technique. This method helps in understanding the angular width and inclination of the CMEs as they propagate through space.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CMEs in the near-Sun environment
- **Time Range**: 1997 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We investigated 31 CME-ICME associations in the period from 1997 to 2018."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Coronal mass ejections have been observed remotely with white-light coronagraphs."
- **Physical Observable**: Angular width and inclination of CMEs
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME orientation in the near-Sun environment was determined using an ellipse-fitting technique applied to single-spacecraft data from SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs."
- **Additional Comments**: The data from these instruments were crucial for the initial characterization of CMEs before they evolve into ICMEs as they approach Earth.

### WIND and ACE on board respective spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - These spacecraft provided in situ plasma and magnetic field data to obtain the orientation of the corresponding ICMEs in the near-Earth environment. This data is essential for understanding the interaction of ICMEs with the Earth's magnetosphere and predicting space weather effects.

#### Data Collection Period 1: In situ measurements of ICMEs
- **Time Range**: 1997 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We investigated 31 CME-ICME associations in the period from 1997 to 2018."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation of the corresponding ICME using in situ plasma and magnetic field data."
- **Physical Observable**: Orientation, plasma parameters, magnetic field configuration of ICMEs
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation of the corresponding ICME using in situ plasma and magnetic field data."
- **Additional Comments**: The data from WIND and ACE are vital for correlating the behavior of ICMEs with their source CMEs observed by SOHO/LASCO, providing a comprehensive understanding of the propagation characteristics from the Sun to Earth.
