## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper titled "The Sun’s Magnetic Power Spectra Over Two Solar Cycles. I. Calibration Between SDO/HMI And SOHO/MDI Magnetograms" by Yukun Luo, Jie Jiang, and Ruihui Wang focuses on analyzing the Sun's magnetic field across various spatial scales using spherical harmonic decomposition of synoptic magnetograms from the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI instruments. The study spans three solar cycle minima and aims to calibrate and analyze the magnetic power spectra derived from these instruments. A key finding is the identification of a calibration factor that varies with the spatial scale of the magnetic field, which is crucial for consistent power spectra across different instruments. The paper also identifies typical supergranular scales and discusses the implications for understanding solar magnetic dynamics and cycle-dependent behaviors.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI on SOHO is used to capture high-resolution full-disk magnetograms of the Sun, crucial for studying various magnetic features across a broad range of spatial scales.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping period with SDO/HMI for calibration
- **Time Range**: From Carrington Rotation (CR) 2097 to CR 2104
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ni I 6768 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength and configuration
- **Additional Comments**: The data from MDI was used in conjunction with SDO/HMI data to calibrate magnetic field measurements across different spatial scales. The resolution of the MDI data is 3600 × 1080 pixels.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI on SDO provides detailed observations of the solar photosphere, allowing for precise measurements of the magnetic fields over the solar surface.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping period with SOHO/MDI for calibration
- **Time Range**: From Carrington Rotation (CR) 2097 to CR 2104
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength and configuration
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data was used to calibrate against SOHO/MDI data to ensure consistency in magnetic power spectra. The resolution of HMI data is 3600 × 1440 pixels.

Both instruments are critical for the study's objective to analyze and calibrate the magnetic power spectra over multiple solar cycles, focusing on the variations and consistencies in the measurements provided by these two different instruments. The calibration process is essential for comparing data across different instruments and resolving discrepancies in the measurement of magnetic fields at various spatial scales.
