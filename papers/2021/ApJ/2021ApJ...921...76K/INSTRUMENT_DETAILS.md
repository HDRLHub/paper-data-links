# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a machine learning–based study to predict soft proton intensities in the near‐Earth space using 17 years of data obtained primarily from the Cluster mission. The proton intensities—from roughly 28 keV up to several MeV—are observed by instruments on board Cluster and are used to understand magnetospheric dynamics as well as the contamination affecting X‐ray telescopes. The study leverages data from the RAPID instrument (and complemented by the CIS instrument) on Cluster SC4 (Tango) covering the period from January 2001 to February 2018 UT. In addition, the paper discusses the relevance of these observations for instruments such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, ATHENA, and SMILE, illustrating the impact of soft proton contamination on X-ray observations.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors (RAPID) on board Cluster SC4 (Tango)
- **General Comments**:
   - RAPID is designed to measure energetic electron and ion intensities over a broad energy range (from approximately 30 keV to 4 MeV).
   - It produces about 50 data products from raw observations, which are archived in the Cluster Science Archive.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors (RAPID) instrument (Wilken et al. 2001) on four Cluster satellites (Escoubet et al. 2001) measures distributions of energetic electron and ion intensities from ∼30 keV to ∼4 MeV.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Main Proton Observations

   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “From 15:21:00 on 9 January 2001 to 09:57:00 on 19 February 2018 UT, 6,051,937 minutes of data in total matched these criteria.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable – the instrument measures particle energies rather than electromagnetic wavelengths. Energy channels detail:
   - Channels cover energy ranges such as p1 = 28–64 keV, p2 = 75–92 keV, p3 = 92–160 keV, p4 = 160–374 keV, p5 = 374–962 keV, p6 = 962–1885 keV, and p7 = 1885–4007 keV.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...the first seven energy channels as the labels in our experiment, which represented the energy ranges p1=28–64 keV, p2=75–92 keV, p3=92–160 keV, p4=160–374 keV, p5=374–962 keV, p6=962–1885 keV, p7=1885–4007 keV...”
- **Physical Observable**: Energetic proton intensities obtained from omnidirectional flux measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The omnidirectional energetic proton intensities can be found at CSA under the product proton Dif flux C4 CP RAP HSPCT.”
- **Additional Comments**: Data from RAPID serves as the primary set for training the machine learning model; it provides continuous observations for Cluster SC4 (Tango).

### 2. Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) on board Cluster
- **General Comments**:
   - The CIS instrument provides additional proton observations that are combined with RAPID data to enhance the overall dataset.
   - It is used to complement the measurements by the RAPID detector.
