# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

Below is a detailed list of all instruments mentioned in the paper along with the corresponding time ranges, the spacecraft or facility they belong to, and the contextual details provided in the text. In several cases a single instrument appears in more than one event; each distinct data‐collection period has been noted with its start and end times (expressed as Day of Year [DOY] and year) along with the heliocentric distance range. In most cases the instruments provided in situ measurements of the magnetic field (and when available, plasma observables), although the paper notes that for some spacecraft (i.e., MES and VEX) the plasma measurements (e.g., flow speed) were missing.

- **General Comments**:  
  MESSENGER provided in situ magnetic field measurements in the inner heliosphere. In the study, MES is used to obtain data on magnetic clouds (MCs) where plasma measurements are not available, helping to determine the MC speed by interpolating from available coronagraphic and near‐Earth (Wind/STA/STB) measurements.

  “In the following, we analyze 11 events that were observed by at least two radially aligned spacecraft. In particular, we employ data measured by MESSENGER (MES), Venus Express (VEX), Helios 1 and 2 (H1, H2), Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-8 (IMP8), Wind, STEREO-A (STA), STEREO-B (STB), Pioneer 11 (P11), Voyager 1 and 2 (V1, V2)...” (page 2–3 of the excerpt)
