### Explanation:
1. **Import Libraries**: We start by importing necessary modules from `sunpy.net` and `astropy.units`. These are essential for constructing the query with proper units and attributes.
2. **Define Time Range**: The time range from 1995 to 2018 is set based on the context provided, which covers the period of observations used in the study.
3. **Set Up Queries**: Two separate queries are prepared for the 17 GHz and 34 GHz data. These frequencies are specifically mentioned in the context as being crucial for the study of gyroresonant emissions.
4. **Print Query Results**: The results of the queries are printed to verify the data that would be fetched. This step is crucial for ensuring that the queries are correctly set up before any data download.
5. **Data Download**: The actual download commands are commented out to prevent unintentional data fetching during script testing or review.

This script is tailored to the specific requirements provided in the context and adheres strictly to the details given, ensuring accuracy and relevance in data fetching for the scientific study described.
