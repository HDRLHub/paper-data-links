## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes space weather disturbances, specifically Forbush decreases (FDs) and geomagnetic storms (GMSs), that were triggered by two solar eruptions in early September 2017. The study uses the Early Diagnostics of Solar Eruption Geoeffectiveness (EDSEG) tool to estimate the disturbance scales from the magnetic flux of EUV arcades and dimming regions. The principal data sources include extreme ultraviolet images (to trace arcades and dimmings), line-of-sight magnetograms (to measure photospheric magnetic flux), soft X-ray profiles (to time flare peaks), coronagraph images (to estimate CME speeds), and in situ solar wind measurements. Observational data were derived from several instruments onboard different spacecraft spanning multiple time ranges—from the 1996–2005 interval (SOHO/EIT and SOHO/MDI) to the post-2010 period (SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI) and real-time measurements during the September 2017 events (GOES, SOHO/LASCO, DSCOVR, and ground-based neutron monitors). These elements are integral to correlating the early solar surface signatures with subsequent geospace effects.
