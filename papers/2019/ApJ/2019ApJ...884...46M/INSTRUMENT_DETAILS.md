## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed multi-wavelength investigation of the eruption of a pre-existing hot coronal channel (interpreted as a magnetic flux rope) in association with an X1.0 flare from active region NOAA 11875 observed on 2013 October 28. The study synthesizes imaging and spectral data from several spaceborne and ground‐based instruments covering wavelengths from EUV, UV, and white light to soft and hard X-rays as well as dynamic radio spectra. The observations span different phases of the flare (pre‑flare, precursor, impulsive, and gradual), and the paper emphasizes early pre‑flare processes as well as the activation, transition, and rapid acceleration of the hot channel that eventually triggered a CME. The timing details (UT times from as early as 00:30 UT for disk imaging, through distinct phases at ~00:45–01:37 UT, ~01:37–01:53 UT, and ~01:53–02:02 UT, and CME detection by coronagraphs up to ~07:30 UT) are crucial to linking these phenomena and constraining physical processes such as magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is used to capture high-resolution full-disk images of the solar corona in multiple (E)UV channels. Its high temporal cadence and spatial resolution enable the detection and tracking of the pre-existing hot channel, its activation, and subsequent eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “For observing the Sun in (E)UV wavelengths, we use high resolution (0.′′6 pixel−1), 4096×4096 pixel full disk observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). Temporal cadences are 12 s for the EUV ﬁlters, 24 s for the UV ﬁlters and 3600 s for the white light ﬁlter.”
