## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the relationship between the Sun's seismic radius, as measured from fundamental (f) modes of oscillation, and the variation in Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) over solar cycles 23 and 24. The analysis uses long-term, uninterrupted helioseismic data collected by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), covering the period from May 1, 1996 to June 3, 2017. The study also incorporates TSI measurements from the VIRGO instrument onboard SoHO for the same period. By directly processing f-mode frequency data and corresponding irradiance records, the work derives the magnitude and cyclical variation of seismic radius changes and assesses their correlation with TSI fluctuations, establishing that magnetic field variations dominate irradiance changes, while seismic radius plays a secondary, only weakly anti-correlated role.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The MDI instrument was used to collect solar f-mode frequency data for the period from May 1996 to April 2011, providing key data on solar oscillation modes needed to estimate seismic radius changes across solar cycle 23 and into solar cycle 24. This dataset forms the bulk of the f-mode frequencies analyzed in the paper.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We use f-mode frequencies in the spherical harmonic degree ℓ≤300 from the medium-ℓ program of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI; Scherrer et al. 1995) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012), covering a period of about 21 years, i.e. nearly two solar cycles (23 – 24), starting from mid 1996 to mid 2017. In total, 74 MDI (May 1, 1996 – April 24, 2011) and 36 HMI (April 30, 2010 – June 3, 2017) data sets are used."

    "The MDI observations are in the Ni I 6768 ˚A line as opposed to HMI observations in Fe I 6173 ˚A line; the formation height of Fe I line is lower in atmosphere than the Ni I line."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar oscillation f-mode frequencies (n=0, ℓ≤300)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Since we are interested in f-mode frequencies, we analyze n = 0 modes only."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  Improved MDI frequency datasets correcting for previously known annual periodicities were used.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In this work, we use improved frequency data from MDI (Larson & Schou 2015, 2018), which include improvements in a number of geometric corrections made during spherical harmonic decomposition..."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Overlap and cross-calibration with HMI
- **Time Range**: 2010-04-30 – 2011-04-24  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Note that there are 5 overlapping sets between MDI and HMI from April 30, 2010 to April 24, 2011. ... For this purpose, we use 5 overlapping 72-d sets from MDI and HMI covering the observation for about a year, i.e., from mid-2010 to mid-2011."

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The MDI observations are in the Ni I 6768 ˚A line as opposed to HMI observations in Fe I 6173 ˚A line..."
- **Physical Observable**: Simultaneous f-mode frequency series for cross-instrument calibration  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The frequency diﬀerences for individual modes in all ﬁve sets are shown... It is evident that there are small diﬀerences in the mean shifts for individual epochs, however majority of these lie within 1σ error. This close agreement between frequencies from simultaneous observations from both missions allows us to combine two data series to form an uninterrupted long data series for about two solar cycles."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  Combined and cross-validated to ensure continuity across instrument change.
