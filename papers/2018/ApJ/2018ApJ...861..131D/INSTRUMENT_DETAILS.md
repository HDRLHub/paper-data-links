## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates whether the availability of nearby open magnetic flux influences the eruptivity of solar active regions during X-class flares. The study uses a sample of 56 flares observed over Sunspot Cycles 23 and 24 and examines the coronal magnetic topology with potential field source-surface (PFSS) models. Various instruments provide the necessary observations – ranging from X-ray flux measurements to EUV and white-light coronal imagery – occurring over different time periods. The observations from GOES, SOHO, and SDO (and their sub-instruments) supply data on X-ray emission, photospheric magnetic fields, and coronal structure, which are crucial for both the flare detection and the magnetic topology analyses.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. GOES/XRS on board Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES/XRS (X-ray Spectrometer) is used to detect solar flares via their X-ray emission in the 1–8 Å wavelength band. The GOES flare catalog serves as the primary source for classifying flares (e.g., X-class based on peak flux).
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The GOES ﬂare catalog1 categorizes ﬂares in terms of their peak ﬂux in the 1–8 Å wavelength band."

### 3. SDO/HMI on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) supplies high-resolution photospheric magnetic field data post-2010, which is equally important for initializing the PFSS models and understanding the magnetic environment of flare sites.

      - **Supporting Quote**: "…on board SDO (after 2010)…"
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (measures magnetic fields via Doppler shifts in spectral lines, not a fixed wavelength channel)

   - **Additional Comments**: HMI’s continuous high-resolution observations allow for detailed analysis of the magnetic plays that determine flare eruptivity.
