1. BATSE (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) on board the Compton Gamma‐Ray Observatory  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - BATSE is the primary instrument used in this study to record and analyse gamma‐ray burst (GRB) light curves. It provided the largest single data set for GRBs (∼2,700 events) and features multiple data‐modes.  
     - The instrument collects photon arrival times with a native sampling frequency of 500 kHz (in time‐tagged event, TTE, mode), but due to hardware limitations many bursts are provided as binned light curves. Two data products are highlighted: discsc bfits (with 64 ms bins) and pre‐binned tte bfits (with 5 ms bins).  
     - BATSE records each burst for approximately 240 seconds after triggering, which is critical for capturing both the primary pulse and any potential gravitational lens “echo.”  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “For bursts not completely encoded in a TTE list, the counts are averaged into 64 ms bins before transmission, typically recorded for ∼240 s after triggering.”  
     - “We utilise the four available broadband energy channels of BATSE burst data independently.”  
     
   - **Data Collection Period and Time Ranges**:  
     - Data are recorded during each GRB trigger for approximately 240 seconds after the event.  
     - Two temporal resolutions are used: a 64 ms binning (discsc bfits) and a higher-resolution 5 ms binning (pre‐binned tte bfits), the latter applicable for bright and short bursts such as GRB 950830.
       - **Supporting Quote**: “Furthermore, higher‐time‐resolution observations are available for 2,446 of these γ‐ray bursts, with 2,435 existing as pre‐binned tte bfits (5 ms) light curves.”
     
   - **Wavelength(s), Detectors, and Observables**:  
     - BATSE operates in the gamma‐ray energy range. Its four Large Area Detectors (LADs) measure broadband γ‐rays across four energy channels:
       - Channel 1: 20–60 keV  
       - Channel 2: 60–110 keV  
       - Channel 3: 110–320 keV  
       - Channel 4: 320–2000 keV  
     - Physical observables extracted include photon count rates, light-curve pulse shapes (modeled by FRED or FRED-X profiles), time delays between pulse repetitions, and hardness (e.g. hardness ratio H32 defined from channels 3 and 2).  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “Each colour indicates a different energy channel, red: 20–60 keV, yellow: 60–110 keV, green: 110–320 keV, blue: 320–2,000 keV.”  
     
2. Advanced LIGO and Virgo  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - These gravitational‐wave detectors are mentioned in the context of comparing instrumental sensitivity ranges. They are noted to be sensitive to mergers with total masses ≲400 M⊙. This contextual comparison emphasizes that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), as inferred in this work, generally fall outside their optimal sensitivity range.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational‐wave Observatory (LIGO) [9] and Virgo [10] are sensitive to mergers with a total merger‐product mass of ≲400 M⊙.”
     
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - No explicit observation time ranges are provided in the context for LIGO/Virgo; they are cited for a sensitivity comparison rather than for direct temporal observations of the GRBs.  
     
   - **Wavelength(s) and Observables**:  
     - These instruments detect gravitational waves (not electromagnetic radiation), with their sensitivity range indirectly referenced through the mass scale of merger events.
     
3. Fermi Gamma‐Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - Fermi GBM is referenced in connection with autocorrelation searches and model comparisons in GRB lensing studies. While not the primary data source in this paper, its data catalogue is noted to be similar in size to BATSE’s, and past GRB lens searches with GBM have been mentioned.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “Autocorrelation has been used on the Fermi GBM and Swift BAT catalogues [6]…”  
     
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - No specific time ranges for Fermi GBM observations are provided in the context.
     
   - **Wavelength(s) and Observables**:  
     - As with BATSE, Fermi GBM observes gamma‐rays across its energy bands, but further details (such as specific energy channels or detector configuration) are not provided.
     
4. Swift BAT (Burst Alert Telescope)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - Swift BAT is cited when discussing GRB redshift measurements and the GRB population’s mean redshift. Its mention serves to highlight differences in GRB samples rather than to provide detailed observational data used in the lensing analysis.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “Note that the mean redshift of Swift short GRBs is ⟨zs⟩≈0.8.”  
       
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - No explicit time ranges are detailed for Swift BAT observations in the provided context.
     
   - **Wavelength(s) and Observables**:  
     - Swift BAT detects gamma‐rays; specific energy-channel details and detector configurations are not elaborated in the context.
     
5. Konus‐Wind and the Interplanetary Network  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - These instruments are mentioned in the context of previous lensing searches and comparisons to the BATSE catalogue. The Konus‐Wind instrument, along with data from the Interplanetary Network, has been used in studies searching for gravitationally lensed GRBs.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “The Fermi and Konus‐Wind catalogues are similar in size to the BATSE GRB catalogue…” and “A Search for Gravitationally Lensed Gamma‐Ray Bursts in the Data of the Interplanetary Network and Konus‐Wind.”  
     
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - The context does not provide specific observation time ranges for Konus‐Wind or the Interplanetary Network; they are referenced for comparative purposes.
     
   - **Wavelength(s) and Observables**:  
     - Both instruments detect gamma‐rays. Detailed specifications such as energy channels or temporal resolution are not provided in the text.
