1. Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE) on TIMED  
   • Description: SEE is used to measure the Sun’s extreme‐ultraviolet (XUV) emission over a broad wavelength range (approximately 5–912 Å). Its data feed is used in studies quantifying the solar XUV flux and, in turn, relating that flux to the evolution of the solar wind and the open magnetic flux.  
   • Detectors / Observables: It records the solar irradiance in the EUV part of the spectrum.  
   • Time Range: The provided context does not specify an explicit observational time range for SEE data.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “Figure 18 shows the solar XUV ﬂux … calculated from the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE) instrument on board the NASA Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) spacecraft (Woods et al. 2005).”  

2. Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)  
   • Description: HMI produces full‐disk vector magnetic field measurements (synoptic magnetograms) of the Sun. These data are used to compute the surface magnetic flux and to derive “Sun‐as‐a‐star” magnetic field estimates by filtering the high-resolution maps (only using low spherical harmonic orders).  
   • Detectors / Observables: It detects photospheric magnetic fields and is used to construct magnetic synoptic maps.  
   • Time Range:  
     – Observations used for the “Sun-as-a-star” analysis span from 2010.5 to 2019.5 (covering solar cycle 24).  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “The solar synoptic maps used to compute the magnetic ﬂux are from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (Scherrer et al. 2012). … Colours show temporal evolution with darkest colour corresponding to year 2010.5 and lightest colour to year 2019.5 (solar cycle 24).”

3. SOLIS (Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun)  
   • Description: SOLIS is employed to generate high-resolution synoptic maps of the solar magnetic field. These maps provide detailed information on the spatial structure of solar magnetism.  
   • Detectors / Observables: It records optical spectropolarimetric data to reconstruct photospheric magnetic field maps.  
   • Time Range: The text does not provide a specific observational time range for the SOLIS data used.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “Middle: Synoptic map of the Sun plotted with data from Gosain et al. (2013).”  

4. Kepler, K2, and TESS Missions  
   • Description: These space missions are mentioned in the context of high-cadence observations. They are used to detect and study white-light flares on solar-like stars, which serve as proxies for stellar magnetic activity.  
   • Detectors / Observables: They observe in the optical band and detect continuum flaring events.  
   • Time Range: No explicit start or end times for the observations are provided in the context.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “White‐light flares are frequently seen in high‐cadence observations of missions such as Kepler, K2 and TESS.”

5. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)  
   • Description: The VLA is referenced in relation to radio observations that may detect weak free–free emission signatures from stellar winds. Upgrades to the VLA are mentioned as a path towards improving sensitivity.  
   • Detectors / Observables: It observes radio frequencies and is used to set upper limits on mass loss from stellar winds through detection (or non-detection) of the expected faint radio continuum.  
   • Time Range: No specific observational time range is indicated in the text.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “At the time of writing (Spring 2020), there exist plans to upgrade the existing VLA system …”

6. Square Kilometre Array (SKA) – Future Facility  
   • Description: The SKA is mentioned as a future radio telescope expected to have a sub–microjansky sensitivity. Its improved sensitivity is anticipated to enable direct detections of the weak radio emission from nearby young solar-type stars.  
   • Detectors / Observables: It will operate at radio wavelengths below ~1 GHz and detect radio free–free emission from stellar winds.  
   • Time Range: No time range is provided because SKA is a planned, future instrument.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “The expected sub‐µJy sensitivity level of the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA) means that winds of close-by young suns are potentially detectable [below 1 GHz].”

7. Parker Solar Probe  
   • Description: Parker Solar Probe provides in situ measurements of the solar wind by flying very close to the Sun. It is used to measure plasma properties such as wind speed, density, and magnetic field at heliocentric distances much closer than 1 au.  
   • Detectors / Observables: In situ particle and field detectors record parameters like wind speed (e.g. 400 km/s at Earth’s orbit scale) and magnetic field strength.  
   • Time Range: The context mentions “the first encounter” but does not provide exact start or end dates.  
   • Supporting Quote:  
     “Measurements of the ﬁrst encounter of NASA’s Parker Solar Probe were recently released, probing the solar wind at distances as close as 36 R⊙ ≃ 0.17 au. PSP … will get closer and closer to the Sun, reaching … a perihelion of 0.046 au – typical of hot Jupiters.”

8. Solar Orbiter  
   • Description: Solar Orbiter, launched by ESA in February 2020, is designed to study the solar wind and the Sun’s corona from multiple heliographic latitudes and at distances as close as ~0.29 au.  
   • Detectors / Observables: It carries a suite of in situ and remote-sensing instruments to measure solar wind parameters, imaging of the solar corona, and magnetic field properties.

   • Supporting Quote:  
     “A second complementary spacecraft, ESA’s Solar Orbiter, was launched in February 2020 and will also study the solar wind at close distances, down to 0.29 au, albeit at high heliospheric latitudes.”
