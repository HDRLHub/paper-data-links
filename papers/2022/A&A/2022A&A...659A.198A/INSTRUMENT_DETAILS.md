# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of narrowband spike-like bursts observed in solar type-II radio bursts. By combining high-resolution dynamic spectra with imaging data, the authors analyze fine temporal structures in spike chains that trace the type-II shock front. The study uses two main instruments during the extreme solar event recorded on November 3, 2003 (SOL2003-11-03T09:43:20), and it compares its findings with similar observations from other facilities. The paper focuses on detailed measurements of spike durations, sizes, positions, and brightness temperatures, and discusses the role of small-scale magnetic reconnection in the shock front emission.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. ARTEMIS-JLS Solar Radio-Spectrograph – ASG (Sweep Frequency Analyzer)
- **General Comments**:
   - The ARTEMIS-JLS instrument is equipped with a 7 m moving parabolic dish covering the metric range (and a dipole aerial for the decametric range added in October 2002). It features two receivers operating in parallel. The ASG is the sweep frequency analyzer that provides a medium-time-resolution dynamic spectrum.
   - It plays a key role in providing an overview of the radio emission from the base of the corona outward, capturing the broadband activity during the event.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Two receivers operate in parallel: a sweep frequency analyzer (ASG) covering the 650–20 MHz range in 630 channels with a cadence of 10 samples/sec…” 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Event Overview
- **Time Range**: The ASG data covers the entire SOL2003-11-03 event starting at SOL2003-11-03T09:43:20 UT. (Exact end time is not explicitly stated, but it encompasses the complete activity as seen in the upper panel of Fig. 2.)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “An overview of the radio activity of the event based on the ARTEMIS-IV/JLS ASG receiver … presented in Alissandrakis et al. (2005).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 650–20 MHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…a sweep frequency analyzer (ASG) covering the 650–20 MHz range in 630 channels…”
- **Physical Observable**: Broadband dynamic spectra of solar radio emission from the base of the corona to approximately 2R⊙.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…the broadband, medium-time-resolution data of the ASG … are used for the detection and analysis of radio emission from the base of the corona to ∼2R⊙.”

#### Additional Comments:
- The ASG data is used primarily to outline the overall radio activity and to help identify the type-II burst structure that is later analyzed in conjunction with high-resolution data.

### 2. ARTEMIS-JLS Solar Radio-Spectrograph – SAO (Acousto-optic Analyzer)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SAO is the high-sensitivity multi-channel acousto-optic analyzer that records detailed dynamic spectra in a limited frequency band with high temporal resolution. It is crucial for resolving the fine temporal and spectral details of the spike-like structures.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...a high-sensitivity multi-channel acousto-optical analyzer (SAO), which covers the 270–450 MHz range in 128 channels with a high time resolution of 100 samples/sec.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Type-II Harmonic Emission and Spike Analysis
- **Time Range**: The SAO dynamic spectrum registered the onset of the type-II harmonic emission starting at 09:51:35 UT on November 3, 2003. The high-resolution segment (illustrated by the 5 min white box in Fig. 2) covers the period during which spike chains and their fine structures are observed.  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The type II harmonic emission started at 09:51:35 UT above 500 MHz, well within the Artemis-JLS/SAO frequency range…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 270–450 MHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...covers the 270–450 MHz range in 128 channels…”
- **Physical Observable**: High-time-resolution dynamic spectra that capture narrowband, short-duration (sub-100 ms in some cases) spike-like bursts which are indicative of small-scale energy releases and possibly magnetic reconnection.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Narrowband bursts (spikes) … are very small duration and bandwidth bursts which appear on dynamic spectra …”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - A high-pass Gaussian filter (1 s width) was applied to enhance the fine structures, thereby isolating the spike-like features for detailed analysis.

### 3. Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NRH provides two-dimensional images of the Sun at multiple radio frequencies, offering spatial context for the observed radio emissions. It is used in conjunction with the ARTEMIS-JLS instruments to pinpoint the positions of the spike-like structures relative to the overall type-II burst emission.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Images of the radio emission were obtained from the Nançay Radio Heliograph (NRH) … which records two-dimensional (2D) images of the Sun at five frequencies (164, 236.6, 327, 410.5, and 432 MHz) with a time resolution of 150 ms.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: 327 MHz Observations
- **Time Range**: From 09:52:00 UT to 09:52:16 UT on November 3, 2003.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Source positions from 09:52:00 to 09:52:16 UT at 327.0 MHz …”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 327.0 MHz (within the spectral range of both ASG and SAO).
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…the 327, 410.5, and 432 MHz Nançay radioheliograph channels.”
- **Physical Observable**: Two-dimensional images of solar radio emission that provide information on the spatial distribution (including size, position, and motion) of the spikes and the associated type-II burst emission.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Images of the radio emission … give important information on the position of the emitting sources …”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The NRH data are also processed to produce one-dimensional (1D) images (by integration along NS and EW directions) for a more convenient comparison with the dynamic spectra. The NRH’s lower temporal resolution relative to the SAO is noted, which explains why some short-duration spikes appear merged in the NRH recordings.

#### Data Collection Period 2: 236.6 MHz Observations
- **Time Range**: From 09:52:27 UT to 09:53:00 UT on November 3, 2003.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “and from 09:52:27 to 09:53:00 UT at 236.6 MHz…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 236.6 MHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The source positions derived … from the 236.6 MHz images …”
- **Physical Observable**: Similar to the 327 MHz data, both the continuum and type-II burst emissions at this frequency are imaged, which helps in discerning spatial displacement and evolution of the burst front.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…the NRH images show a lot of short timescale structures … the type-II positions are consistent with …”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The NRH beam sizes for each frequency (including 236.6 MHz) are provided (see Table 2 in the paper) and help in evaluating the source sizes and spatial resolution in the analysis.

### 4. LOFAR (Low Frequency Array)
- **General Comments**:
   - LOFAR is mentioned as having recorded similar fine structures in type-II radio bursts. Although not directly used in this study’s analysis, its similar observations support the universality of the spike-like features.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “A similar fine structure was also recorded by the LOFAR for the 2014 August 25 type-II radio burst (Magdalenić et al. …)”
- **Time Range**: The LOFAR observation is associated with the 2014 August 25 type-II event. (Exact start and end times are not provided in the context.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: The specific frequency range is not detailed in the provided context.
- **Physical Observable**: Similar narrowband fine structures within the type-II radio burst emission.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The LOFAR observations are referenced for comparison with the ARTEMIS-JLS and NRH data, highlighting that spike-like structures are a recurring feature in type-II events.

### 5. IPRT/AMATERAS
- **General Comments**:
   - The IPRT/AMATERAS is cited as the instrument that recorded fine structures during a different event (the 2014 April 25 event). Its mention supports the broader observation of spike-like emission in various solar radio bursts.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “…and by the IPRT/AMATERAS for the 2014 April 25 event (Tan et al. 2019).”
- **Time Range**: The observation is tied to the 2014 April 25 solar event. (No specific time range is provided in the context.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided text.
- **Physical Observable**: Fine temporal and spectral structures similar to those observed in the ARTEMIS-JLS/SAO data.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Like LOFAR, the IPRT/AMATERAS is mentioned to underline that the observed phenomenon is not unique to the ARTEMIS-JLS/NRH system.
