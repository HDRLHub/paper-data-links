## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the first gradual solar energetic particle (GSEP) event with enhanced 3He abundance observed by Solar Orbiter. The event, which started on November 24, 2020, was associated with a relatively fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME). The study aims to understand the origin of the 3He abundance enhancements in CME-driven shock GSEP events, exploring whether the enhancements are due to re-acceleration of remnant flare material in interplanetary space or concomitant activity in the corona. The paper utilizes data from various instruments on board Solar Orbiter and other spacecraft to analyze the event.
