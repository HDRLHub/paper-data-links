## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study conducts a refined analysis of CME (coronal mass ejection) global energetics for all (860) GOES M- and X-class flare events observed in the first 7 years (2010-2016) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. The research focuses on modeling CME properties using direct observations of EUV dimming as detected with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO. It also makes direct comparisons to traditional white-light scattering CME measurements obtained using the LASCO coronagraph on SOHO, with both data sets analyzed and compared for the same events within the specified 2010–2016 period. Data from AIA are used for EUV dimming profile measurements and DEM analysis, covering six coronal EUV wavelengths and providing physical parameter derivations central to the paper’s findings. LASCO white-light CME data, sourced from established online catalogues, are employed for the measurement and comparison of CME mass and speed using the coronagraph’s white-light capacity. The results derive from these two instrument sources, focusing on direct event-by-event statistical comparison and physical inference, with specific observation periods, wavelengths, and physical observables documented in detail.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The AIA instrument's EUV imaging data form the foundation for measuring EUV dimming and performing DEM analysis to derive CME mass, speed, and energy for 860 flare events from 2010–2016. The study uses all six coronal EUV AIA channels for time-series analysis and spatial-synthesis DEM inversion, providing the essential physical observables for the paper’s CME modeling and energetics results.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The reﬁned CME model is entirely based on EUV dimming observations (using AIA/SDO data) and complements the traditional white-light scattering model (using LASCO/SOHO data), and both models are independently capable to determine fundamental CME parameters such as the CME mass, speed, and energy."
  - "The content of this paper contains... observations from the Atmospheric Imager Assembly (AIA) (Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Pesnell et al. 2011) and data analysis in terms of forward-ﬁtting the reﬁned CME model to the EUV dimming data (Section 3)..."
  - "The analyzed data set includes all GOES M- and X-class ﬂare events recorded during the ﬁrst 7 years (June 2010 - Nov 2016) of the SDO mission, which amounts to 864 events, ... Only 4 events of the AIA data set contained data gaps during the ﬂare time interval, which are discarded here, while 860 events remain for further analysis."
  - "The first step in our analysis of AIA ﬂare data is the automated diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis, using the spatial-synthesis DEM code (Aschwanden et al al. 2013), which uses the 6 coronal AIA wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335 ˚A) and yields a time sequence of DEM distributions dEM(T, t)/dT , as described in the previous Papers II and IV."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Global monitoring and analysis of all GOES M- and X-class flares (EUV dimming profiling)
- **Time Range**: 2010-06–2016-11 (entire period of June 2010 through November 2016, covering all solar events analyzed)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The analyzed data set includes all GOES M- and X-class ﬂare events recorded during the ﬁrst 7 years (June 2010 - Nov 2016) of the SDO mission, which amounts to 864 events..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335 Å (EUV wavelengths – all six coronal channels on AIA)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "...which uses the 6 coronal AIA wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335 ˚A) and yields a time sequence of DEM distributions dEM(T, t)/dT..."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV dimming (total emission measure evolution EM(t)), spatially synthesized DEM profiles, CME source volume, mass, center-of-mass motion, velocity, and acceleration profiles derived from the EUV images
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The analysis procedure is depicted in Fig. 3, which consists of the measurements of the ﬂuxes in each AIA wavelength (Fig. 3a) and the DEM inversion of the total emission measure proﬁle EM(t) (Fig. 3e), which is ﬁtted with the theoretical CME model (red proﬁle in Fig. 3e)..."
- **Additional Comments**: Temporal sampling of AIA data for event analysis is conducted in steps of ∆t = 2 min to cover the entire flare duration.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The time evolution of the analyzed images is subdivided into steps of ∆t = 2 min, covering the entire ﬂare duration as deﬁned by the start and end times (prolonged by a margin of 30 min) from the GOES ﬂare list."

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO coronagraph data are directly used for CME mass and speed assessments for the sample of events associated between the AIA event list (2010–2016) and LASCO CME catalog detections. LASCO provides the white-light coronagraphic CME properties for comparison with AIA-inferred parameters, with direct measurements of CME leading-edge detection time, speed, and mass at specific heliocentric distances.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "We were able to measure a EUV dimming eﬀect, and therefore a CME mass, in all 860 ﬂares from AIA/SDO data, while the white-light data from LASCO/SOHO reported a CME detection in about 432 events thereof."
  - "For a comparison of AIA results with LASCO data of CMEs we have ﬁrst to evaluate which events are associated. The primary time deﬁnition of the analyzed events comes from the GOES ﬂare catalog, which deﬁnes a start, peak, and end time for each of the analyzed ﬂare events."
  - "The LASCO data are catalogued in a CME event list that is available online, https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/ CME_list/, and their detection time is deﬁned when the CME leading edge shows up the ﬁrst time at the edge of the LASCO occulter disk at a distance of x3 = 4R⊙from Sun center."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME detection in white-light for AIA-/GOES-associated events (mass/speed measurement)
- **Time Range**: 2010-06–2016-11 (corresponding to each associated event from the SDO/AIA event list identified in LASCO catalog during June 2010 to November 2016)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We were able to measure a EUV dimming eﬀect, and therefore a CME mass, in all 860 ﬂares from AIA/SDO data, while the white-light data from LASCO/SOHO reported a CME detection in about 432 events thereof."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (visible continuum – Thomson-scattered solar light)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME mass here with two diﬀerent methods, either with the conventional method based on the white-light polarized brightness in coronagraph images, or with the novel method using the EUV dimming."
- **Physical Observable**: CME leading-edge detection time, projected speed, CME mass from polarized brightness, CME kinetic energy
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For LASCO observations for instance, the occulting disk is at x3 = xLASCO ≈4R⊙, where the CME mass mLASCO, the speed vLASCO, and the detection time tLASCO is measured, which can then be compared with the values m3, v3, and t3 of our CME model."
- **Additional Comments**: Association timing is based on first appearance of the CME leading edge at 4 solar radii; data are from the LASCO/CDAW catalog.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The LASCO data are catalogued in a CME event list that is available online, https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/ CME_list/, and their detection time is deﬁned when the CME leading edge shows up the ﬁrst time at the edge of the LASCO occulter disk at a distance of x3 = 4R⊙from Sun center."
