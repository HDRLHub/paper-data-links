## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a detailed analysis of an M5.5-class eruptive flare that occurred in active region 12929 on January 20, 2022. The study focuses on the eruption of a hot channel that generated a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and a dome-shaped extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave. The flare exhibited quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in various wavelengths, indicating intermittent energy release and electron acceleration. The interaction between the EUV wave and adjacent coronal loops (ACLs) resulted in contraction, expansion, and transverse vertical oscillation of the loops. The paper proposes a new scenario to explain these interactions and suggests that the phenomena observed are fundamentally similar to previously known behaviors of coronal loops.
