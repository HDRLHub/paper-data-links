## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyses a GOES M3.7-class solar flare observed on 04-Nov-2015. The study focuses on the presence of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) detected across multiple wavelengths—from soft X-rays (SXR) and hard X-rays (HXR) through extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to low‐frequency radio. By applying imaging and time-series (wavelet) analyses, the authors correlate periodicities across different observables and localise the QPP source to a specific flare footpoint. Instruments on several spacecraft, spanning from SDO/AIA (EUV imaging) to RHESSI (HXR imaging), WIND/WAVES (radio dynamic spectra), FERMI GBM (HXR flux) and GOES XRS (SXR flux), were used. Their coordinated observations during the flare (approximately from 13:31 UT to 13:57 UT—with many analyses focusing on the interval 13:34–13:54 UT) were critical to linking the electron acceleration processes to the observed pulsations.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA was used to obtain high-cadence EUV images in two distinct passbands: 171 Å and 1600 Å. The 171 Å channel (dominated by the Fe XI line) primarily images the corona and upper transition region, while the 1600 Å channel (dominated by C IV emission) images the upper photosphere/transition region.
   - The instrument’s high temporal resolution (cadence of 12 s for 171 Å and 24 s for 1600 Å) allowed the authors to build time-series from selected kernels within the flare region and to localise the source of QPPs.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The most pronounced pulsations we observed with AIA were from the 171 ˚A and 1600 ˚A passbands. The cadences of these images were 12 s and 24 s, respectively.”

- **Data Collection Period 1: EUV Observations in 171 Å**
   - **Time Range**: While an exact UT range for the AIA imaging is not explicitly stated, the analysis of QPPs (via wavelet analysis) was performed over the period 13:34–13:54 UT during the impulsive phase of the flare.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “For each lightcurve, wavelet analysis was conducted over the same time period: 13:34-13:54 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å (EUV)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The 171 ˚A passband is dominated by the Fe XI line and most represents emission from the corona and upper transition region.”
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity variations associated with coronal plasma emission.

- **Data Collection Period 2: EUV Observations in 1600 Å**
   - **Time Range**: The same overall interval of 13:34–13:54 UT was used for constructing time-series to study the pulsations.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The pulsations within the 1600 ˚A light curves yielded periodicities of 131+36−27 s.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å (EUV/UV)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The 1600 ˚A passband is dominated by C IV and images primarily the upper photosphere/transition region.”
   - **Physical Observable**: Variability in EUV/UV intensity linked to the upper atmospheric response during the flare.

### 2. RHESSI on board the RHESSI Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) was used to image hard X-ray (HXR) sources associated with the flare. The instrument’s imaging capabilities were enhanced using the PIXON algorithm to accurately reconstruct the location and morphology of the emitting regions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “RHESSI observed the event up until 13:43 UT before entering spacecraft night. This allowed us to image the location of the HXRs produced during the flare.”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: HXR Imaging**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 13:35 UT to 13:43 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “RHESSI observed the event up until 13:43 UT before entering spacecraft night. This includes the first two prominent pulsations in the sequence of 7.”
   - **Wavelength(s)/Energy Range**: 35–70 keV used for imaging and also compared with 25–50 keV from complementary instruments.
   - **Physical Observable**: Non-thermal bremsstrahlung emission from flare footpoints related to accelerated electrons.

### 3. WIND/WAVES RAD2 on board the WIND Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The WIND/WAVES RAD2 instrument provided dynamic spectra covering the frequency range 0.02–13.85 MHz. It was used to capture the radio signature of the flare in the form of type III radio bursts attributed to plasma emission from escaping electron beams.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The WIND/WAVES RAD2 instrument was used to gather radio data. Dynamic spectra from 0.02-13.85 MHz (cadence: 16.188 s) were analysed to investigate the low-frequency aspect of the QPPs.”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: Radio Dynamic Spectra**
   - **Time Range**: Although an exact start and end time is not specified separately, the analysis was performed in conjunction with other instruments during the flare’s impulsive phase (approximately 13:34–13:54 UT), with additional interpretation made based on overall event timing.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Across the electromagnetic spectrum, the impulsive nature of the event begins at ∼13.37 UT and continues until ∼13.57 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)/Frequency**: Emphasis on the 2.5 MHz channel extracted as representative of the radio bursts.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The green light curve in Figure 3b shows a slice from this dynamic spectrum at 2.5 MHz…”
   - **Physical Observable**: Radio emission via coherent plasma processes (type III bursts) from accelerated electrons rising along open magnetic field lines.

### 4. FERMI GBM on board the FERMI Gamma-ray Space Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - FERMI’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) was used to capture high-energy emissions in the hard X-ray (HXR) regime. The GBM data in the 25–50 keV energy range were analysed for periodicities associated with non-thermal electron precipitation during the flare.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 5a shows the wavelet analysis that was carried out on the GBM 25-50 keV lightcurve.”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: HXR Flux Monitoring**
   - **Time Range**: Analysis was focused on the period 13:34–13:54 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “For each lightcurve, wavelet analysis was conducted over the same time period: 13:34-13:54 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)/Energy Range**: 25–50 keV.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The HXR light curve from FERMI GBM (25-50 keV) …”
   - **Physical Observable**: Non-thermal hard X-ray flux from electron bremsstrahlung in the chromosphere.

### 5. GOES XRS on board the GOES Satellites
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES X-Ray Sensor (XRS) measures the solar soft X-ray (SXR) flux integrated over the entire solar disk using two channels: 0.5–4 Å and 1–8 Å. In this work, the 1–8 Å channel was emphasised because it exhibited the most pronounced QPPs.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The GOES XRS measures the solar SXR ﬂuxes integrated over the entire solar disk. It has a cadence of 2 s with two channels… in this work, we primarily focus on the 1-8 Å channel as it exhibited the most pronounced QPPs.”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: Soft X-ray Monitoring**
   - **Time Range**: The flare began at 13:31 UT, peaked at 13:52 UT, and the impulsive-plus-decay phase spanned roughly until 13:57 UT. For wavelet analysis, the effective time window was 13:34–13:54 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The event began at 13.31 UT and peaked at 13.52 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å (Soft X-rays).
   - **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray flux related to the thermal emission from plasma heated by the precipitating electron beams; additionally, the time derivative of the SXR light curve was analysed to compare with HXR emission.
