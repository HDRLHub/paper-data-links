## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates long-term solar activity by using microwave imaging observations and related magnetic field measurements. It primarily uses microwave brightness temperature (Tb) observations as proxies for both the polar magnetic field and active-region phenomena. The analysis incorporates data from several instruments over different time periods—from the early 1990s to recent solar cycles—to track features such as prominence eruptions and “rush to the poles” events. These observations, when combined with magnetic field data and solar wind measurements, are used to assess polar field reversals and to predict the strength of solar cycle 25.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - NoRH is used to obtain microwave images at 17 GHz that capture the solar brightness temperature, which serves as a proxy for the polar magnetic field and active-region emission. The instrument has a spatial resolution of about 10″ and produces daily-best images taken near local noon (≈3 UT). It also provides the basis for deriving Carrington rotation maps and the microwave butterfly diagram.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We use microwave imaging observations from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz … The basic data used in the construction of the butterfly diagram are the daily-best microwave images taken around local noon (3 UT) at 17 GHz. These images have a spatial resolution of about 10” …”
