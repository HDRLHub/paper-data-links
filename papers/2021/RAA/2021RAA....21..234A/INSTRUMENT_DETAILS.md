## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the effect of solar wind parameters and geomagnetic storm indices on the variation of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux through the detection of Forbush decreases (FDs). The study employs daily-averaged cosmic ray data from ground-based neutron monitors, specifically from the Oulu Neutron Monitor Station, covering the period from 1998 to 2002. In addition, corresponding solar wind and geomagnetic indices (including solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field intensity, Dst, kp, and ap indices) are obtained via the OMNI database. The paper validates a newly developed automated FD location code by examining the correlation between FD amplitudes and these space weather parameters. References are also made to past investigations using other neutron monitor stations such as the Deep River Neutron Monitor, highlighting historical observations and methodologies in cosmic ray research.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Oulu Neutron Monitor (NM) Station
- **General Comments**:
   - The Oulu NM station is a ground-based instrument used to record pressure-corrected, raw cosmic ray intensity with daily averages. It is the primary facility used in this study for detecting Forbush decreases.
   - The station is characterized by a geomagnetic cutoff rigidity of 0.77 GV, a geographic location of 25.47°E, 65.05°N, and an altitude of 0 m.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "We have taken Oulu neutron monitor (NM) pressure-corrected raw cosmic ray intensity daily averaged data between 1998 to 2002 from IZMIRAN common website..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  
  #### Data Collection Period 1: 1998–2002
  - **Time Range**: 1998 – 2002 (inclusive; exact dates as listed in Tables 2 and 3).
     - **Supporting Quote**: 
        - "...from Oulu NM station between 1998 and 2002..."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable for neutron monitors.
     - **Supporting Quote**: No specific wavelengths mentioned as the instrumentation detects secondary neutrons from cosmic ray interactions.
  - **Physical Observable**: Cosmic ray intensity (as well as Forbush decrease events derived from variations in CR counts).
     - **Supporting Quote**: 
        - "Daily averaged cosmic ray (CR) data at Oulu neutron monitor station" and "the amplitude and timing of FDs from daily-averaged cosmic ray (CR) data..."
  - **Additional Comments**: The Oulu NM data serves as the baseline for automated detection of FD events and subsequent correlation with solar wind and geomagnetic parameters.

### 2. OMNI Database (Solar Wind and Geomagnetic Data)
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI database is a consolidated archive of solar wind and geomagnetic activity data. It provides daily mean values for solar wind speed (SWS), interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) intensity, and geomagnetic indices (Dst, kp, ap).
   - Although not a single instrument, the OMNI database aggregates observations from various space-borne instruments and ground-based measurements to supply essential solar-terrestrial parameters.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Daily mean solar wind speed (SWS), IMF, disturbance storm-time index (Dst), geomagnetic indices kp and ap data are obtained from the OMNI database https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/ow_data.html."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  
  #### Data Collection Period 1: 1998–2002
  - **Time Range**: 1998 – 2002 (matching the period of the Oulu NM observations)
     - **Supporting Quote**: The FD events and associated solar wind data presented in Tables 2 and 3 cover the period from 1998 to 2002.
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; the database provides measurements of plasma and magnetic field parameters rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.
  - **Physical Observable**: 
     - Solar wind speed (SWS)
     - Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) intensity 
     - Geomagnetic storm indices (Dst, kp, ap)
     - **Supporting Quote**: "...solar wind speed (SWS), IMF, disturbance storm-time index (Dst), geomagnetic indices kp and ap..."
  - **Additional Comments**: The OMNI database data are essential for correlating the cosmic ray variations (FD events) observed by the Oulu NM with solar wind structures and geomagnetic disturbances.

### 3. Deep River Neutron Monitor (Referenced Instrument)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Deep River Neutron Monitor is mentioned in the paper as part of earlier studies on cosmic ray flux variations and their relation to interplanetary magnetic field intensity.
   - Although not used in the current analysis, it serves as a historical benchmark for how cosmic ray measurements have been conducted in previous decades.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Barouch & Burlaga (1975) reported an association between FDs and variations in IMF intensity using Deep River neutron monitor data from 1967 to 1968. They noted that from 1967 to 1968, all the cosmic ray ﬂux variation is associated with the passage of a region when magnetic ﬁeld intensity is high."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  
  #### Data Collection Period 1: 1967–1968
  - **Time Range**: 1967 – 1968
     - **Supporting Quote**: "using Deep River neutron monitor data from 1967 to 1968."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable for neutron monitors.
  - **Physical Observable**: Cosmic ray flux.
     - **Supporting Quote**: "...all the cosmic ray ﬂux variation is associated with the passage of a region when magnetic ﬁeld intensity is high."
  - **Additional Comments**: This reference illustrates historical efforts in cosmic ray observation and provides a comparison point for the automated FD detection technique applied in the current work.
