produce the script. We need to query data from the ACE/EPAM and SoHO/ERNE instruments for the specific date of the ESP event, which is 14 July 2012. Since the data involves particle intensities and not electromagnetic wavelengths, we will focus on the time range and the physical observables related to ion and proton intensities. The instruments are not directly available through the VSO interface provided by SunPy, so we will simulate the query process assuming these instruments were available. The script will be structured to reflect the data used in the context, focusing on the specific time range and the instruments mentioned.
