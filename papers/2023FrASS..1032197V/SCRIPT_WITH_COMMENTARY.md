```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period as specified in the context
start_date = '2014-11-01'
end_date = '2022-09-30'

# Time range for the entire observation period
time_range = a.Time(start_date, end_date)

# K-Coronagraph (K-Cor) on MLSO: Used for observing CME kinematics
kcor_instrument = a.Instrument("K-Cor")

# Since the physical observable related to velocity and acceleration is not directly available,
# we use intensity as a proxy to fetch the relevant data.
kcor_query = Fido.search(time_range, kcor_instrument)

# Display the query results
print("Query for K-Coronagraph (K-Cor) Data:")
print(kcor_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# kcor_files = Fido.fetch(kcor_query)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing necessary modules from `sunpy.net` and `astropy.units`. These are essential for constructing the query with the correct units and attributes.

2. **Defining the Observation Period**: The time range from November 2014 to September 2022 is set based on the context provided, which is crucial for ensuring that we are looking at the correct dataset.

3. **Setting up the Instrument**: We specify the K-Coronagraph (K-Cor) at MLSO as the instrument of interest. This is directly tied to the study's focus on CME kinematics.

4. **Query Construction**: The query is constructed using the `Fido.search` function with the defined time range and instrument. Although the specific physical observables like velocity and acceleration are not available, we proceed with intensity data, which is a standard observable for such instruments and can be used to infer kinematic properties indirectly.

5. **Query Execution and Output**: The script prints out the query results. This allows for a verification step before proceeding to download the data, which can be done by uncommenting the `Fido.fetch` line.

This script is tailored to the specific needs of the study as described in the context, focusing on the capabilities and data available from the K-Coronagraph at MLSO.
