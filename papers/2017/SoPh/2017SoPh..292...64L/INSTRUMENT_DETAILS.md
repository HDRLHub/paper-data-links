## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper is a comprehensive review of the interaction of successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs), with an emphasis on initiation mechanisms, heliospheric propagation, particle acceleration, radio signatures, and geoeffects on Earth’s magnetosphere. The study places particular importance on direct observations and in situ measurements obtained from specific instrumentation since the 1970s. Key results and syntheses throughout the review are built upon data from several heliospheric and solar-observing instruments, including imaging from coronagraphs (e.g., LASCO on SOHO, COR on STEREO), heliospheric imagers (STEREO/HI, SMEI), and in situ solar wind measurements (e.g., ACE, Wind, DSCOVR). Case study summaries and statistics reference observations made in well-defined date ranges, predominantly between the early 1970s and 2016, with expanded coverage during Solar Cycles 23 and 24 (circa 1996–2016). The detailed findings are grounded primarily in these instrument data, often focusing on specific events, CME series, and geoeffective periods, with corresponding physical observables such as CME speed, density, magnetic field, and in situ plasma parameters.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO coronagraph imagery is used for measuring CME properties in the corona, including speed, mass, acceleration, angular width, and initiation timing, forming the basis for event timing, statistics, and direct CME-CME interaction observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Some CME properties in the corona are now routinely measured by space-based coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/LASCO: Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995, Brueckner et al., 1995)... Catalogs such as the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) CME catalog (Yashiro, Michalek, and Gopalswamy, 2008; Gopalswamy et al., 2009) report the CME speed, mass, acceleration, and angular width projected onto the plane-of-the-sky of the instruments."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME waiting time and initiation studies
- **Time Range**: 1999–2001 (and reference to 1997–1998 for source location linking)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "An early attempt to examine the independence of CMEs was done by Moon et al. (2003b), who considered 3817 CMEs listed in the LASCO CME catalog (Yashiro et al., 2004) during 1999–2001."

### Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI), Heliospheric Imager (HI), and COR on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Data from the STEREO coronagraphs and Heliospheric Imagers are used to track CMEs beyond LASCO's field of view, enabling direct detection of CME-CME interactions in the heliosphere and measurement of CME speeds, directions, and expansion. 3D kinematics and case studies are grounded in data from these instruments.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "New catalogs such as such as the Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and Techniques Service (HELCATS)1 based on STEREO/Heliospheric Imager (HI: Eyles et al., 2009) observations give CME speed and direction in the IP space."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Routine wide-angle imaging, CME-CME tracking
- **Time Range**: Since late 2000s; routine from 2007 onward (launch of STEREO)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The development of heliospheric imaging with the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI: Eyles et al., 2003, Jackson et al., 2004) and the HIs onboard STEREO have led to a large increase in the number of published cases of CME-CME interaction being remotely observed. ... Reported observations became relatively routine with the development of heliospheric imaging, first with SMEI starting in 2003 and, second with the heliospheric imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO starting in 2007..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (white-light Thomson scattering)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Although a number of SMEI observations focused on series of CMEs (Bisi et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2008), their analyses did not dwell on the physical processes occurring during CME-CME interaction. However, one of the very first CMEs observed remotely by STEREO was in fact a series of two interacting CMEs (Harrison et al., 2009; Lugaz et al., 2008; Lugaz et al., 2009; Lugaz, Vourlidas, and Roussev, 2009; Odstrcil and Pizzo, 2009; Webb et al., 2009)."
- **Physical Observable**: 3D CME kinematics, density structures, interaction regions, direction, expansion, and collision signatures
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Wide-angle heliospheric imaging of CMEs, now routinely performed by STEREO, has resulted in a new era of study of CME-CME interaction where 3D kinematics can be combined with Sun-to-Earth imaging of succession of CMEs, 3D numerical simulations and radio observations."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Case studies (e.g., August 2010, May 25, 2010, February 2011, November 2012)
- **Time Range**:
    - August 2010 events
    - May 25, 2010 (HI1A/HI1B)
    - February 15, 2011 (HI1A)
    - November 10, 2012
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Figure 7. Observations of CME-CME interaction in LASCO/C3 and STEREO/HI1 field-of-view. (a) shows the two CMEs from the initial report of CME-CME interaction by Gopalswamy et al. (2001).

- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (white-light)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Although a number of SMEI observations focused on series of CMEs (Bisi et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2008), their analyses did not dwell on the physical processes occurring during CME-CME interaction."
- **Physical Observable**: Time–distance profiles of CME fronts and sheaths, direct observation of overtaking interactions, tracking of dense CME structures
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Remote observations can be used to determine the velocity of the dense structures, but not really that of the low-density magnetic ejecta. As discussed in Lugaz, Manchester, and Gombosi (2005) and further in Lugaz, Vourlidas, and Roussev (2009), when the trailing shock impacts the leading magnetic ejecta, the dense sheath behind the shock must remain between the two magnetic ejecta, even as the shock propagates through the first ejecta. As HIs observe density structures, the observations may not be able to capture the shock propagating through a low-density ejecta."

### Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) on board Coriolis
- **General Comments**:
  - SMEI provided early, wide-angle remote imaging of heliospheric CMEs and their interactions before STEREO, supporting longitudinal event tracking, speeds, and density enhancements.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The development of heliospheric imaging with the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI: Eyles et al., 2003, Jackson et al., 2004) and the HIs onboard STEREO have led to a large increase in the number of published cases of CME-CME interaction being remotely observed."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Early heliospheric imaging of CME interactions
- **Time Range**: SMEI operational from 2003 (referenced until STEREO era)
  - **Supporting Quote**:

### Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind, and Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) at L1
- **General Comments**:
  - In situ measurements from ACE, Wind, and later DSCOVR are foundational to analysis, providing key plasma, magnetic field, and shock data for interpreting CME-CME structures, speeds, field strengths, boundaries, and geoeffects at Earth.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "CME properties near Earth are directly measured by spacecraft such as Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind, or Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR, operational since July 27, 2016)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: L1 in situ analyses, Solar Cycle 23–24 (routine studies)
- **Time Range**: 1996–2016  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In the rest of the article, we focus primarily on developments about the causes and consequences of series of CMEs since 2000. The combination of LASCO imaging and in situ measurements at L1 from Wind and/or ACE since 1996 makes it possible to relate coronal observations with their in situ consequences and geomagnetic effects."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; in situ plasma and magnetic field monitoring
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "CME properties near Earth are directly measured by spacecraft such as Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind, or Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR, operational since July 27, 2016)."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind speed, density, temperature, magnetic field magnitude and orientation, shocks, sheath regions, ejecta boundaries, Multiple-MC structures, storms
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the study of CME-CME interaction proliferated following the report of two CMEs interacting within the LASCO/C3 field-of-view and associated type II event (Gopalswamy et al., 2001) as well as the possible association of interacting CMEs with large SEP events (Gopalswamy et  al., 2002). Statistical surveys of geomagnetic storms and their interplanetary causes have become more routine during Solar Cycles 23 and 24 due to reliability of L1 measurements; this has revealed how interacting CMEs may cause intense geomagnetic storms."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Event-specific in situ analysis (March–April 2001; 31 March – 1 April 2001)
- **Time Range**: March 10, 2001 – April 11, 2001 (full 31 days)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Figure 11. Solar wind measurements and geomagnetic indices of a 31-day period in March-April 2001. The panels show, from top to bottom, the proton density, bulk speed, temperature (expected temperature in red), the eleven ICMEs identified in this period, the Bz component of the magnetic field (in GSM coordinates), the total field, the proton β, the storm-time Dst index and the planetary Kp index..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: In situ (plasma and field; energy-resolved ions and electrons)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The strong geomagnetic effects of partial or total ejecta mergers may be considered to result from a combination of two effects: on top of the geoeffectiveness of the individual ejecta there is that introduced by the interaction process. Data and simulations have elaborated on aspects of CME-CME interactions which enhance their geoeffectiveness."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton density, solar wind bulk speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field vector (Bz, total B), plasma beta, occurrence of ICME boundaries, shock passages, geoindices (Dst, Kp)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The geomagnetic storm during the event on 31 March – 1 April 2001 (Figure 10a) has been studied by many researchers. Most relevant here is that Farrugia et al. (2006a) argued that the extreme severity of the storm was ultimately due to a very dense plasma sheet combined with strong southward magnetic fields. They showed that the plasma sheet densities were, in turn, correlated with the high densities in the ejecta merger. Since compression of plasma is a feature of CME-CME interactions, they concluded that the interaction was ultimately responsible for causing this superstorm, with Dst reaching values below −250 nT for several hours."

#### Data Collection Period 3: In situ detection of CME-CME shock interactions
- **Time Range**: 1997–2006 (statistical survey)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In the study of Lugaz et al. (2015b), the authors identified 49 such shocks propagating within a previous magnetic ejecta between 1997 and 2006."
- **Wavelength(s)**: In situ (plasma and field)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "most of CME events collide far from where plasma and magnetic field parameters are actually monitored. An exception is the 30 September 2012 event, which revealed interaction between two CMEs close to 1AU (probably started interacting ∼0.8 AU) as shown in studies by Liu et al. (2014b) and Mishra, Srivastava, and Singh (2015)."
- **Physical Observable**: Shock propagating within magnetic ejecta, changes in density, B-field, speed profile, shock/shock merging
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Most such shocks occur towards the back of the ejecta, and shocks tend to be slower as they get closer to the CME front. This can be interpreted as an indication that a number of shocks dissipate inside a CME before exiting it."

### Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES particle detectors are used for measuring solar energetic particle (SEP) intensities at specific energy thresholds, which underpin correlations with CME properties and the twin-CME scenario.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Using this time delay, they found that 60% twin-CMEs lead to large SEPs while only 21% single CMEs lead to large SEPs. Furthermore, all large SEP events with a peak intensity larger than 100 pfu at > 10 MeV/nuc recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) are twin-CMEs."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SEP intensity statistics vs CME interactions
- **Time Range**: Solar Cycle 23 (1996–2008)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Ding et al. (2013) and Ding et al. (2014a) tested the twin-CME scenario against all large SEP events and fast CMEs with speeds > 900 km s−1 from the western hemisphere in Solar Cycle 23."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Particle detection, >10 MeV/nuc (protons)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "all large SEP events with a peak intensity larger than 100 pfu at > 10 MeV/nuc recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) are twin-CMEs."
- **Physical Observable**: SEP event peak intensity at >10 MeV/nuc
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Gopalswamy (2004) showed that there exists a strong correlation between high particle intensities and the presence of preceding CMEs within 24 hours of the main SEP-accelerating CME."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Geostationary plasma sheet density during superstorm
- **Time Range**: 31 March – 1 April 2001
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "total ion densities above ∼100 eV acquired by three Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft in geostationary orbit on the nightside (18-06 MLT)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ion density above ~100 eV
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "total ion densities above ∼100 eV acquired by three Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft in geostationary orbit on the nightside in colored symbol, and the compound plasma sheet density (divided by four for clarity)."
- **Physical Observable**: Nightside plasma sheet density during CME-CME-driven geomagnetic storm
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The strength of the ring current depends mainly on two factors: (i) the electric field in which the particles drift as they travel inwards from the plasma sheet, and (ii) the density of the plasma sheet itself, since it constitutes the seed population (Jordanova et al., 2006). In this case, we have a large enhancement of the latter."
