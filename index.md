# Welcome to Paper Data Links

This repository currently focuses on data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO). Our initial efforts are dedicated to cataloging and linking VSO data used in academic papers. The files in this repository are initially drafted using AI and then manually validated for quality assurance. We plan to expand our scope to include other data sources in the future.
