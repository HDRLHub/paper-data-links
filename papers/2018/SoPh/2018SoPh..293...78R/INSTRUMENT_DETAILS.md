## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their solar origins during Cycle 24, with a particular focus on the period from January 2010 to August 2011. The study combines in‐situ plasma, magnetic field, and ion composition measurements with remote-sensing observations of the solar corona (via EUV and white-light coronagraphs) to identify the solar sources of the ICMEs. A key aspect of the investigation is the detailed analysis of ion charge states to differentiate between single-source events and complex, multiple-source events created by successive or interacting CMEs or by CME–high-speed stream (HSS) interaction. The work employs a wide array of instruments that include in-situ spacecraft sensors (on ACE and WIND), EUV imagers (SDO/AIA and SOHO/EIT), coronagraphs (LASCO on SOHO and COR2 on STEREO-A/B), and X-ray detectors (GOES and SPHINX) to provide both the temporal context and the physical observables of solar wind disturbances and their solar drivers.
