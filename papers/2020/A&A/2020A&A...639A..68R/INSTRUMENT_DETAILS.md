## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a statistical investigation of the kinematics of 28,894 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as recorded by the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs from 1996 until mid‐2017. The study focuses on two distinct phases in CME propagation: an initial (or “main”) acceleration phase and a residual (or deceleration) phase. The LASCO instruments provide the height–time measurements from which instantaneous speeds, maximum speeds (VMAX), residual speeds (VRES), and derived accelerations are obtained. The work discusses not only the overall period covered by SOHO/LASCO but also gives historical context by mentioning prior instruments like the OSO‐7 coronagraph and additional instruments (e.g., STEREO/HI) that have been used in complementary studies.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. LASCO Coronagraph on board the SOHO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The primary instrument used in this study, the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO), routinely recorded CMEs from 1996 to mid‐2017.
   - It provided the imaging data (through manual determinations of height–time points) used to derive kinematic parameters such as acceleration and velocity profiles in the LASCO field of view (LFV).
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Since 1995 CMEs have been intensively studied using the sensitive Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft (Brueckner et al. 1995).”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Observations from 1996 until mid-2017**
      - **Time Range**: 1996 – mid-2017
      - **Supporting Quote**: “In this paper we present a statistical study of the kinematics of 28894 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) recorded by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft from 1996 until mid-2017.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - Not explicitly provided in the paper.
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - CME properties (height-time profiles, instantaneous velocities, maximum and residual accelerations).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The basic attributes of CMEs, determined manually from running difference images, are stored in the SOHO/LASCO catalog.”
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The LASCO data have been fundamental in studying the propagation phases of CMEs over two solar cycles (23rd and 24th).

### 2. LASCO C1 Coronagraph on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The C1 coronagraph was designed to image the inner corona, capturing observations near the solar surface.
   - However, it has not been operational since a temporary loss of SOHO.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Unfortunately, the C1 coronagraph that was used to observe near the surface of the Sun has not been operational since the temporary loss of SOHO in June 1998.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Operational before June 1998**
      - **Time Range**: Up to June 1998 (inferred from the statement)
      - **Supporting Quote**: As above.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Specific wavelengths are not detailed in the paper.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Captured the innermost coronal images where CME initiation can be observed.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Its early operational period contributes context to the evolution in observational capabilities; however, data from C1 were not used for the current study.

### 3. LASCO C2 Coronagraph on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 is one of the coronagraphs used in this study and, together with C3, covers a field-of-view that extends from 2 to 32 solar radii (RS UN).
   - It provides images used to derive the height–time points of CMEs in the outer corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In our research we used images from the C2 and C3 coronagraphs whose field of view covers the area 2 - 32 RS UN.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Usage during the study period**
      - **Time Range**: 1996 – mid-2017 (as part of the overall LASCO observations used)
      - **Supporting Quote**: Implied by “Since 1996 CMEs have been routinely recorded by the sensitive LASCO coronagraphs on board the SOHO mission...”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not explicitly detailed.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The instrument records CME brightness and structure used for determining kinematic parameters such as velocity and acceleration.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The C2 instrument is crucial for observing events beyond the innermost corona (starting at 2 RS UN).

### 4. LASCO C3 Coronagraph on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - Complementing the C2, the LASCO C3 coronagraph extends the observational field out to 32 solar radii.
   - It is used to measure the late-stage propagation of CMEs and to provide residual kinematic data.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In our research we used images from the C2 and C3 coronagraphs whose field of view covers the area 2 - 32 RS UN.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Usage during the study period**
      - **Time Range**: 1996 – mid-2017
      - **Supporting Quote**: As noted in the LASCO overall operating period.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not specified in the paper.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Records CME propagation characteristics that enable the determination of residual acceleration and final velocities.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Together with C2, the C3 coronagraph provides a comprehensive view of the entire CME evolution within the LASCO field of view.

### 5. OSO-7 Coronagraph on board the OSO-7 Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The OSO-7 coronagraph is noted for recording the first CME.
   - It serves as a historical reference highlighting the evolution of coronagraphic observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The ﬁrst CME was recorded by the coronograph on board the 7th Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-7) satellite (Tousey 1973).”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - Specific dates are not provided in the paper, but it is referenced as an early instrument in CME studies.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not specified in the context.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Imaged coronal structures leading to the initial identification of CMEs.
