## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the temporal, spatial, and kinematic interrelationships of consecutive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using a large statistical data set. The authors analyze more than 27,000 CMEs observed by coronagraph instruments over more than two decades. They discuss waiting times, position-angle differences, and speed differences between successive CMEs, and use advanced statistical techniques (including heavy‑tailed probability distributions and detrended fluctuation analysis) to reveal long‑range dependence (“memory”) in the CME process. The findings place important constraints on models of CME initiation and propagation, particularly in the context of energy release and the modification of the coronal medium by preceding events.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. OSO‑7 – White‑light Coronagraph Experiment
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument was part of the OSO‑7 spacecraft mission and is notable for being the first to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using a white‑light coronagraph. Its observations laid the groundwork for later CME studies.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were discovered in the 1970s by the observations of the white‑light coronograph experiment on board the OSO‑7 mission (Tousey et al. 1973).”

#### Data Collection Period 1: 1970s Observations (Discovery Phase)
- **Time Range**: 1970s (exact dates are not provided, but the discovery era is stated as during the 1970s)
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - “...CMEs were discovered in the 1970s by the observations of the white‑light coronograph experiment on board the OSO‑7 mission (Tousey et al. 1973).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White‑light (visible continuum)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - The term “white‑light coronograph” indicates the instrument imaged in the visible band.
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Detection and imaging of coronal structures that later were recognized as CMEs.
   - **Additional Comments**:  
      - Although no detailed detector specifications are given, the instrument’s use of white‑light imaging was pivotal in identifying large‑scale mass ejections in the solar corona.

### 2. LASCO on board the SOHO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) is a key instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. It has been extremely successful in providing high‑quality white‑light images of the solar corona and in measuring key CME properties such as speed, angular width, and kinetic energy. Its data have been continuously used to build extensive CME catalogs.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “In particular, the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO, Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft has been very successful in contributing considerably to this understanding of CME characteristics.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: February 2, 1999 – December 31, 2018
- **Time Range**:  
   - Start: February 2, 1999 at 16:35 UT  
   - End: December 31, 2018 at 09:48 UT  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - “...we consider only 28 270 CMEs observed after the second major data gap, starting with the CME observed on February 2, 1999 at 16:35, and finishing with the CME observed on December 31, 2018 at 09:48 UT.”
- **Additional Context on Time Coverage**:
   - The overall LASCO observations have been available continuously since 1996. However, a major three‑month data gap in 1998 is noted (when the SOHO spacecraft was temporarily disabled), and initial CMEs around the beginning of the LASCO mission were excluded to avoid potential instrumental errors.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - “The observations have been continuously available since 1996, with a major three‑month gap in 1998 when the SOHO spacecraft was temporarily disabled…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White‑light (broadband visible light)
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - The use of a coronagraph “observing in white‑light” is inherent in the description “…first appears in the LASCO ﬁeld of view (FOV) above the occulting disk.”
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Key CME properties are measured including:  
     • Speed  
     • Angular width  
     • Central position angle (CPA)  
     • Acceleration  
     • Mass  
     • Kinetic energy  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - “The CME database includes the basic sky‑plane measurements of CMEs such as speed, angular width, central position angle, acceleration, mass, and kinetic energy.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The instrument’s cadence varied between 12 and 40 minutes (depending on observation mode), with the cadence doubling after August 2010, which influenced the effective resolution of waiting time determinations between consecutive CMEs.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
      - “Another source of systematic errors is the cadence of the instrument. In the case of LASCO, this is between 12 and 40 min (depending on the observation mode)…”
