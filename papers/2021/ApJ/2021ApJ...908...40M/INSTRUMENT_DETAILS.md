## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study presents an in‐depth analysis of a high Alfvén Mach number (MA = 27) quasi‐perpendicular shock observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft on 28 December 2015. The paper focuses on the shock dynamics—including shock reformation, the generation of proto‐shocks, and surface rippling—and relates these phenomena to the behavior of reflected ions and the ensuing wave activity. Observational data from various high‐time‐resolution instruments (magnetic, electric, and particle detectors) provide detailed insight into the plasma dynamics across different regions of the shock (solar wind, shock foot, ramp, and downstream). The instruments recorded data over specific intervals (with key segments for example from ~03:57:15 UT to ~03:59:00 UT and the overall crossing from 03:56:12 UT to 04:00:15 UT) and at very high cadence, enabling the identification of multiple plasma and field signatures associated with shock reformation cycles and surface ripple generation.

### 2. Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The FPI instrument provides full sky measurements of both ions and electrons over a broad energy range (10 eV/q to 30 keV/q). It is critical for distinguishing between the solar wind beam, the reflected ion population, and the bulk plasma.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The ion and electron data are from the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instrument which provides ion and electron measurements of the full sky ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) in the 10 eV/q to 30 keV/q energy-per-charge range (Pollock et al. 2016)."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Burst Mode Operation during Shock Crossing
- **Time Range**: During the burst mode operation covering the interval of the shock crossing (noted broadly between 03:56:12 UT and 04:00:15 UT on 28 December 2015)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "During a burst mode operation interval when data from all instruments are at their highest resolution... in the burst mode, FPI samples electron and ion populations every 30 and 150 milliseconds, respectively."
- **Wavelength(s)/Energy Range**: Energy-per-charge range from 10 eV/q to 30 keV/q.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "provides ion and electron measurements ... in the 10 eV/q to 30 keV/q energy-per-charge range."
- **Physical Observable**: Particle moments (density, velocity, temperature), and particle distribution functions for both ions and electrons.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Ion moments are calculated for solar wind and reﬂected ions separately" and the discussion on distinct populations with different energies.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The FPI data allow for distinguishing between the cold, narrow solar wind beam and the accelerated/reflected ion populations in the shock foot.

### 3. Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM) on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The SCM instrument is designed to capture AC-coupled magnetic field variations and high-frequency magnetic fluctuations. Its high sampling rate facilitates detailed investigations of wave activity, including those associated with surface rippling and shock reformation.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "AC-Coupled magnetic ﬁeld variations are measured by the search-coil magnetometer (SCM) instrument (Le Contel et al. 2016)."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: High-Frequency Wave Observations during Shock Reformation
- **Time Range**: During the shock crossing event, with specific analyses focused on intervals around 03:58:00 UT (e.g., in Figure 4)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Panels (c - f) show the magnetic ﬁeld data from spacecraft... during selected reformation cycles" and analysis of ripple properties around 03:58 UT.
- **Wavelength(s)**: The instrument captures fluctuations across a broad frequency range (e.g., band-pass filtered for frequencies in the 0.56 - 1.22 Hz range for ripple analysis, and other analyses in the 0.1 - 4 Hz range).
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "data are band-pass ﬁltered in the (0.56-1.22) Hz frequency range" and other mentions of specific frequency bands in subsequent analyses.

      - "Dynamic power spectral densities (PSDs) of electric and magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are generated" and detailed wave analyses in Figures 4 and 6.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The SCM observations contributed to the analysis of surface ripples at the shock ramp and in the shock foot, revealing properties like phase speed, wavelength (≈153 km or 2.1λi), and polarization characteristics.

### 4. Electric Field Double Probe (EDP) on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The EDP instrument consists of double probe sensors mounted along the spacecraft’s spin plane and spin axis, and is used to measure 3D AC-coupled electric fields. It plays a key role in determining the electric perturbations associated with shock reformation and wave activity.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "3D AC-coupled electric ﬁeld measurements are provided by double probe sensors in the spin plane (Lindqvist et al. 2016), and on the spin axis (Ergun et al. 2016), collectively known as electric ﬁeld double probe (EDP)."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Burst Mode Observation during the Shock Event
- **Time Range**: Recorded during the same burst mode interval covering the shock crossing (03:56:12 UT to 04:00:15 UT on 28 December 2015)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "during a burst mode operation interval when data from all instruments are at their highest resolution" (applies to EDP as well).

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Bursts of electric and magnetic ﬂuctuations at frequencies around and below the lower hybrid frequency are observed."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The EDP measurements, once filtered and reprocessed to remove spacecraft spin effects, enabled detailed comparisons between electric and magnetic wave powers and helped to diagnose the nature (electrostatic vs. electromagnetic) of the observed plasma waves across the shock layer.
