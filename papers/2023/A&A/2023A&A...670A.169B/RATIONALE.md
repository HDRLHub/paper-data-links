Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to construct a query to download data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. The context specifies the time range and the wavelengths of interest. We will use the SunPy library to query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for the required data. The query will be based on the time range and the instrument specified in the context.
