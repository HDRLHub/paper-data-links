This script is designed to query the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI data specifically for the observation of solar magnetic fields, which are crucial for constructing synoptic maps used in AR detection. The time ranges are set according to the periods mentioned in the context, ensuring that the queries are as specific as the context allows. The `Physobs` attribute is used to specify that we are interested in the line-of-sight magnetic field measurements. The results of these queries will help in understanding the distribution and evolution of solar magnetic fields, which is essential for the study described in the paper.
