## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the unusual nature and hemispheric asymmetry of the solar polar field reversal during Solar Cycle 24. The research specifically focuses on analyzing solar magnetic fields in latitude ranges 55°–90° and 78°–90° using direct measurements from several solar observation instruments. The study draws on data spanning February 1975 to October 2017, encompassing solar cycles 21–24. The primary data sources include medium-resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms from the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP), high-resolution line-of-sight magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), and high-resolution radial synoptic magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). In addition, the paper utilizes synoptic solar wind velocity maps derived from 327 MHz interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya, Japan, to link photospheric field reversals to heliospheric phenomena. The core research objectives, observational periods, and instrument details are integral to resolving the timeline and nature of the polar field reversals reported.
