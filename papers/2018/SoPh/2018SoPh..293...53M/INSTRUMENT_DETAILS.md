## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper examines a decameter type IV solar radio burst associated with a behind‐the‐limb coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 7 November 2013. Multiple instruments were used to capture the burst’s dynamics and related radio phenomena such as type III and type II bursts. Observations from ground‐based radio telescopes (URAN-2 and NDA) and space‐borne platforms (STEREO A, STEREO B, and SOHO) provided overlapping time coverage and complementary frequency ranges. The high time and frequency resolution data facilitated the analysis of the burst’ frequency drift, the localization of its source in the CME core, and allowed the derivation of plasma densities and CME kinematics.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. URAN-2 (Ukrainian Radio interferometer of Academy Sciences)
- **General Comments**:
   - Ground-based radio telescope located near Poltava, Ukraine.
   - Normally operates in the frequency range 8–33 MHz; however, on the observation day, ionospheric interferences restricted the effective band to 17–33 MHz.
   - It features a broadband 60-channel spectrometer and a digital spectral polarimeter (DSP) with a frequency resolution of 4 kHz and a time resolution of 100 ms, also measuring circular polarization.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “This day the radio telescope URAN-2 (Poltava, Ukraine) carried out observations from 06:00 to 13:30 UT in the frequency band 17 - 33 MHz.”
   - “In Figure 1 the dynamic spectrum of solar radio emission from 10:17 to 11:01 UT in the frequency band 17 - 33 MHz is shown. It is seen that the type IV burst began at approximately 10:22 UT and finished at 10:44 UT.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Dynamic Spectrum & Burst Recording
- **Time Range**: 06:00 UT – 13:30 UT (General observation session on 7 November 2013)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...carried out observations from 06:00 to 13:30 UT in the frequency band 17 - 33 MHz.”
- **Additional Comments**: Although the full session spans several hours, the dynamic spectrum highlighting the type IV burst is best seen between 10:17 and 11:01 UT.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Type IV Burst Registration
- **Time Range**: 10:22 UT – 10:44 UT (precise registration of type IV burst onset and end)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Starting from 10:22 UT and up to 10:44 UT this type IV burst was registered by this radio telescope.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17–33 MHz (with the actual type IV burst noted in the 22–33 MHz sub-range due to discussion in the paper)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...observations were carried out... in the frequency band 17 - 33 MHz” with the type IV burst specifically identified in the frequency range 22–33 MHz.
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of type IV burst dynamics and accompanying type III bursts, including measurements of flux (30–40 sfu for type IV; ~100 sfu for type III) and circular polarization (nearly 40% for type IV and up to 50% for type III).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The fluxes of the type IV burst and type III bursts reached 30 - 40 sfu and 100 sfu respectively... Polarizations of these bursts were high, slightly below 40% for the type IV burst and up to 50% for the type III bursts.”

### 2. NDA (Nancay Decameter Array)
- **General Comments**:
   - Ground-based radio telescope located in Nancay, France.
   - Operates in the frequency band 30–60 MHz.
   - Registered the same set of bursts (type IV, type III, and a weak type II burst) as observed by URAN-2, but in a higher frequency band.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “This burst was observed also by the radio telescope NDA (Nancay Decameter Array) in the frequency band 30–60 MHz.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Type IV Burst Registration

- **Time Range**: 10:16 UT – 10:17 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: “A weak type II burst with a drift rate of about 250 kHz s−1 was observed at frequencies 64 - 44 MHz from 10:16 to 10:17 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily 64–44 MHz and evidence of a burst at 32 MHz around the same time.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the weak burst with flux and polarization of about 10 sfu and 20%, respectively, is observed at [32] MHz...”
- **Physical Observable**: Type II burst characteristics including flux, polarization, and drift rate.
- **Additional Comments**: The NDA data thereby provided complementary information on both strong burst emissions (type IV and type III) and the weak type II burst.

### 3. STEREO A (Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory A)
- **General Comments**:
   - A space-based observatory used to capture solar radio emissions and CME characteristics.
   - Recorded type IV, type III, and type II bursts and provided imagery of the CME, describing it as a compact object with a bright core and envelope.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “At this day [...] STEREO A registered this CME as a compact object with bright core and envelope.”
   - “As reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2016) STEREO A and B registered the type IV burst, type III bursts and type II burst approximately at the same time.”
  
#### Data Collection Period: Type IV and Accompanying Bursts
- **Time Range**: Approximately 10:40 UT – 11:50 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the event on 7 November 2013. At this day, a CME was accompanied by a type IV burst observed by STEREO A and B from 10:40 to 11:50 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Although not explicitly detailed for STEREO A, the instrument observed radio emissions that are discussed within the hectometer range.
- **Physical Observable**: Registration of a type IV burst (albeit weak compared to STEREO B), type III bursts, and the associated type II burst.
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO A’s perspective helped in understanding the compact structure of the CME and provided timing for the progression of the burst.

### 4. STEREO B (Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory B)
- **General Comments**:
   - A space-based observatory complementary to STEREO A, with a more favorable viewing angle for the event.
   - Recorded the type IV burst with better clarity; also detected type III and type II bursts.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “According to STEREO B the type IV burst was observed mainly between 16 to 11 MHz from 10:50 to 11:30 UT.”

   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the type IV burst ... was observed mainly between 16 to 11 MHz from 10:50 to 11:30 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Approximately 11–16 MHz for the type IV burst as observed by STEREO B.
- **Physical Observable**: Captures the timing and frequency evolution (including drift rates) of the type IV burst and also notes associated type III and type II bursts.
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO B provided critical evidence for the burst’s movement, as indicated by the later registration of low-frequency emissions compared to higher frequencies.

### 5. SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - A space-based observatory primarily used here for monitoring the CME.
   - Its data, in conjunction with STEREO A, were used to determine the velocity of the CME core, which was found to be about 550 km s⁻¹.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the velocity of the CME core was only 550 km s⁻¹ according to the STEREO A and SOHO data.”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated; the observations relate to the CME event on 7 November 2013.
- **Additional Comments**: SOHO provided imaging and velocity measurements that helped in constraining the physical parameters of the CME.

### 6. CALLISTO (Compound Astronomical Low cost Low frequency Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - Part of a network of radio telescopes aimed at solar radio spectroscopy.
   - On this day, although CALLISTO participated in solar observations, it did not detect the type IV burst—likely due to limitations in sensitivity.
   - It did, however, register bright type III bursts.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The radio telescopes, which were involved in the CALLISTO project, carried out the observations of the solar radio emission this day, but none of them registered the type IV burst. At the same time CALLISTO registered bright type III bursts at 10:22 and 10:36 UT.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly documented for type IV due to non-detection; bright type III bursts were noted at approximately 10:22 UT and 10:36 UT.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Higher frequency data was attempted but no specific wavelength band is provided in the paper.
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of type III bursts.
- **Additional Comments**: The absence of type IV burst registration highlights the sensitivity differences among instruments.

### 7. ARTEMIS (Appareil de Routine pour le Traitement et l’Enregistrement Magnetique de l’Information Spectral)
- **General Comments**:
   - A solar radio instrument aimed at high-frequency spectral observations.
   - Similar to CALLISTO, ARTEMIS was part of the data search for higher frequency information on the day’s event but did not register the type IV burst.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We also attempted to find higher frequency data from Phoenix, CALLISTO and ARTEMIS instruments but failed.”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Time Range**: Not specified (no successful registration of the burst).
- **Additional Comments**: The inability to detect the type IV burst is attributed to the instruments’ sensitivity thresholds.

### 8. Phoenix
- **General Comments**:
   - Another high-frequency solar radio instrument that was included in the search for data on the event.
   - As with ARTEMIS and CALLISTO, Phoenix did not capture the type IV burst, presumably due to sensitivity issues.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We also attempted to find higher frequency data from Phoenix, CALLISTO and ARTEMIS instruments but failed.”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - **Time Range**: Not provided, as no discernible data on the type IV burst were recorded.
- **Additional Comments**: Phoenix’s non-detection reinforces the challenges of capturing such events in higher frequency regimes with certain instruments.
