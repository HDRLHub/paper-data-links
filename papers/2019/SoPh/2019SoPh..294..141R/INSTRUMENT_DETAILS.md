## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the elemental abundances observed in solar energetic particle (SEP) events with a focus on the relationships of hydrogen (H) and helium (He) with respect to heavier ions. Two distinct types of SEP events are discussed – impulsive events, which are associated with magnetic reconnection in solar jets, and gradual events, which are linked to shock acceleration driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Detailed power‐law dependencies in the mass-to-charge ratio (A/Q) provide insight into the underlying acceleration processes and source-plasma temperatures. Data from in situ particle measurements and remote sensing of CMEs have been utilized to characterize these events across different time intervals including specific events in 2005 and 2014. The study relies on long-term observations from spacecraft instruments to discern variations in SEP elemental composition and to differentiate the physics underlying impulsive versus gradual SEP events.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Low-Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT) on board the Wind spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - LEMT is used to measure the elemental abundances from hydrogen (H) through heavy elements (up to Pb) in solar energetic particle events.
   - It is a particle detector designed for energy measurements in the range of 2–20 MeV amu⁻¹, with a special note that the energy range for protons is limited to 2–2.5 MeV.
   - These measurements are critical for establishing the power-law dependence of element enhancements versus A/Q.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Element abundances in this article were measured by the Low-Energy Matrix Telescope (LEMT) onboard the Wind spacecraft, near Earth (von Rosenvinge et al., 1995; see also Chapt. 7 of Reames, 2017a)."
   - "LEMT measures elements from H through Pb in the region of 2–20MeV amu-1, although energies of H are limited to 2 – 2.5 MeV..."
- 
#### Data Collection Period: Long-Term Observations over 25 Years
- **Time Range**: The Wind spacecraft has operated for 25 years, providing a long-term record of SEP events.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Wind spacecraft has enabled studies of hundreds of solar energetic-particle (SEP) events in its highly productive 25 years of operation."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (LEMT is a charged-particle detector, not a photon-based instrument).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Instrument description does not specify wavelengths as it measures particle energies.)
- **Physical Observable**: Elemental abundances and energy spectra of ions from H through heavy elements; intensity measurements used to construct power-law enhancements versus A/Q.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "These measurements enable studies of the power-law dependence in A/Q of SEP element abundances..."
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The specialized energy coverage (with a narrow window for protons) ensures it accurately captures both “pure” impulsive signatures as well as any proton excess associated with shock reacceleration.
   

### 2. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by imaging the solar corona, thereby providing CME speeds and widths.
   - The CME data are pivotal for linking the properties of impulsive versus gradual SEP events to their respective solar eruption characteristics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "CME data used are observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) as reported in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (Gopalswamy et al., 2009; https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/)."
- 
#### Data Collection Period: CME Observations During Relevant SEP Events
- **Time Range**: Although an explicit full date range isn’t provided, LASCO’s CME data catalog is used for events spanning multiple solar cycles, with specific examples noted such as events on 13 September 2005 and 18 April 2014.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Examples include detailed discussions of SEP event timing such as “14 September 2005 at 0000 UT” and analyses involving events from solar cycle 23 and 24.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observations are made in white light (visible continuum), typical for coronagraph instruments imaging the solar corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The paper refers to LASCO as a “coronagraph,” implying standard white-light observations; specific wavelengths are not detailed.)
- **Physical Observable**: CME speed, width, and overall morphology which are used to differentiate between narrow solar jets associated with impulsive SEP events and the wide, eruptive CMEs associated with gradual SEP events.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The properties of the CMEs associated with impulsive SEP events are those of narrow solar jets, those associated with gradual SEPs are large, wide, eruptive CMEs." 
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - LASCO data, as compiled in the CDAW LASCO CME catalog, provide crucial input for assessing how the shock parameters and CME characteristics influence the acceleration and elemental composition of SEP events.
