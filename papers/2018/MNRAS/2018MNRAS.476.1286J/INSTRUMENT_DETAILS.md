## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed analysis of a helical blowout jet that occurred near the solar limb on 2016 January 9. The study investigates the eruption of a mini-filament—embedded in a fan–spine magnetic configuration—and its evolution into a rotating jet and subsequent narrow coronal mass ejection (CME). The data were obtained using several instruments across multiple wavelengths, with observational time stamps ranging from before 13:15 UT to beyond 16:00 UT on the event day, as well as magnetogram sequences spanning January 6–9, 2016. The high spatial and temporal resolution observations from multiple instruments (EUV, UV, Hα, and white-light) form the backbone of the analysis and are central to understanding the flux rope breaking, the rotational dynamics of the jet, and the acceleration mechanism of the CME.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides full-disk solar images in multiple wavelengths including extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) channels, with a common spatial resolution of 0.6″ per pixel. In this study, data from several AIA channels (304 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 94 Å, 131 Å, and 1600 Å) were used to capture the mini-filament eruption, the evolution of bright structures (compact brightenings and two–ribbon structures), and the subsequent jet dynamics including both the fast eruption and the later rotation.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We used observational data taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). AIA takes full–disk images of the Sun with seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV), two ultraviolet (UV) and one continuum wavelength channels…”

   - **Supporting Quote**: “The height–time proﬁle of the ﬁlament eruption transformed into a jet…” 
- **Physical Observable**: Filament rising motion transitioning from a gentle initial phase to rapid acceleration, indicating the dynamic change leading to jet formation.
- **Additional Comments**: This phase clearly marks the transformation of the filament into a jet as the eruption proceeds.

- **Physical Observable**: The untwisting (rotational) motion of the jet plasma observed as moving blobs and fine threads, with measured rotation speeds.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “We tracked three small plasma blobs… with average speeds of 62±7 km s−1, 115±3 km s−1, and 123±6 km s−1.”
- **Additional Comments**: The detailed analysis of the rotation supports the interpretation of the untwisting of a right–handed filament flux rope consistent with the sinistral chirality of the mini-filament.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides line–of–sight (LOS) magnetograms of the solar photosphere with a spatial resolution of 0.5″ per pixel and a cadence of 45 s. In this study, HMI data were used to obtain the magnetic field configurations, including the presence of a negative polarity patch surrounded by positive polarity and to perform potential-field extrapolations relevant to the fan-spine configuration.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We used the line–of–sight (LOS) magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board SDO. It provides the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data with the resolution of 0.5″ per pixel with a minimum cadence of 45 s.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic Field Mapping
- **Time Range**: 2016 January 6–9 (with a specific magnetogram at 13:12 UT on January 6)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 2 represents snapshots of the line-of–sight magnetograms taken by HMI/SDO during 2016 January 6–9.” and “To calculate the potential magnetic ﬁeld above the region, we used the magnetogram at 13:12 UT on 2016 January 6…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms in white light; sensitive to the photospheric magnetic field)
- **Physical Observable**: The photospheric magnetic field distribution and evolution; identification of polarity inversion lines (PILs) and magnetic null points in the fan–spine configuration.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The magnetic ﬁeld in the same area taken by HMI/SDO is shown in Figure 1(d)...”

### 3. National Solar Observatory-Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO-GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - NSO-GONG provided Hα images that complement the EUV observations by showing the cool filament structure in the chromosphere. These observations help confirm the location and morphology of the mini-filament prior to its eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “…the time–series of EUV data taken with 304 ˚A and 171 ˚A ﬁlters of AIA/SDO are used to study a mini–ﬁlament eruption… in addition to Hα data taken by the National Solar Observatory-Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO-GONG).” 
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament Imaging
- **Time Range**: Concurrent with AIA observations on 2016 January 9 (e.g., around 13:15 UT as seen in Figure 1(c))
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 1(c) shows a corresponding Hα ﬁlament taken by GONG/NSO.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα (6563 Å; typical for chromospheric imaging)
- **Physical Observable**: The dark filament observed in Hα, confirming its presence and structure before the eruption.
- **Additional Comments**: These data provide additional evidence of the filament’s morphology and its evolution in the low solar atmosphere.

### 4. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO observes the solar corona in white light using multiple coronagraphs (C1, C2, and C3). In this study, data from the C2 and C3 coronagraphs were used to track the associated narrow CME, characterizing its propagation, collimation, and acceleration in the higher corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “White light data is taken by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995), which consists of three coronagraphs C1, C2, and C3, on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We used the white light coronagraph data of C2 and C3.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Observation in LASCO C2
- **Time Range**: After 14:00 UT on 2016 January 9 (observations starting from around 14:00 UT)

   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME appeared in the LASCO C3 ﬁeld of view at 15:06 UT… and continued to move upward… Figure 11(g) shows the height–time proﬁle of the narrow CME from 14:00 UT to 16:00 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
- **Physical Observable**: The height–time evolution of the CME, allowing an estimate of the CME speed of ∼630 km s−1.
- **Additional Comments**: The LASCO observations reinforce the interpretation that magnetic reconnection and helicity transfer lead to acceleration of the jet material into the corona.
