## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on mapping the large-scale subsurface plasma flow profile within the Sun, specifically the meridional circulation, using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework applied to helioseismic travel-time difference data. This study spans twenty-one years and utilizes data from two solar cycles, aiming to resolve disagreements in previous studies about whether the flow is single or multiple cells in depth. The paper discusses the methodology, including the use of Bayesian inference and MCMC techniques, and presents findings that suggest differences in the flow profiles between Solar Cycles 23 and 24.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI was used to measure Doppler data crucial for computing travel-time differences essential for studying the solar meridional circulation.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations covering Solar Cycle 23
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The measurements were computed from Doppler data that span from 1996 to 2017, with 12 years of data from solar cycle 23 (1996 to 2008)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided context
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity measurements
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The measurements were computed from Doppler data..."
- **Additional Comments**: Data from MDI was used in conjunction with data from HMI to cover a longer span and improve the reliability of the travel-time differences.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI continued the observations of the solar Doppler velocities for helioseismic studies after MDI, with improved technology and capabilities.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlap and continuation from MDI covering Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: 2008 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "and 9 years of data from solar cycle 24 (2008 to 2017)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided context
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity measurements
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The measurements were computed from Doppler data..."
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data were specifically processed to match MDI data where they overlapped to ensure consistency in the travel-time differences.

### Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG data were used as part of the second dataset analyzed in the study, particularly for observations after the operational period of MDI.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations for Solar Cycle 24 after MDI data collection ended
- **Time Range**: Post-April 30th, 2003 – April 30th, 2019
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Data up until April 30th, 2003 come from MDI, while all data after come from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided context
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity measurements for helioseismic studies
   - **Supporting Quote**: "These data are split into two sets of travel-time difference measurements: cycle 23, which spans from May 1st, 1996 until 2008, and cycle 24, which spans from 2008 until April 30th, 2019."
- **Additional Comments**: GONG data were used to continue the time series of solar observations necessary for long-term studies of solar dynamics, particularly the meridional flows.
