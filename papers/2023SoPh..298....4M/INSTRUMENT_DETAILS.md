# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the application of machine learning techniques to automate the detection of sunquakes using acoustic emission maps from solar active regions. Sunquakes, which are seismic emissions visible on the solar surface associated with solar flares, have been studied using data from Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The authors utilized the helioseismic holography method to process photopheric Dopplergram maps provided by instruments such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The paper highlights the challenges of high noise levels and class imbalance in the data and proposes a dataset for training machine learning models to improve detection capabilities.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI was used to obtain photopheric Dopplergram maps which are crucial for the helioseismic holography analysis. This instrument played a key role in identifying seismic emissions during solar flares from a selected list of sunquake events.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from Solar Cycle 23
- **Time Range**: Specific dates not provided, but includes events from Solar Cycle 23 (approximately 1996 to 2008)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photopheric Dopplergram maps
- **Additional Comments**: The data from MDI was essential for constructing the dataset used for machine learning model training. The instrument's observations contribute to the generation of egression power maps around active regions (ARs).

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI was utilized similarly to MDI for obtaining photopheric Dopplergram maps. It provided enhanced capabilities and higher resolution data compared to MDI, which is critical for detailed helioseismic analysis.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: Specific dates not provided, but includes events from Solar Cycle 24 (approximately 2010 to present)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photopheric Dopplergram maps
- **Additional Comments**: HMI's data was crucial for extending the sunquake dataset to Solar Cycle 24, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis and better training of machine learning models. The higher resolution and improved data quality from HMI enable more precise detection of acoustic sources related to sunquakes.
