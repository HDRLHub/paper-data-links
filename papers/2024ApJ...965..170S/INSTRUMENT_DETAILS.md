## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the relationships between multifrequency microwave fluxes at 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz and their circular polarizations with various solar activity indices during recent solar cycles. The study categorizes these relationships into two groups based on the strength of the relationship with active regions and the dependency of the fitting function on frequency. The paper also explores the extrapolation of these relationships to higher values and compares them with solar-type stars, particularly focusing on Ç« Eri, to confirm the thermal nature of microwave emissions in other stars.

## Instrumentation Details

### Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP) on board Nobeyama campus of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NoRP is used for measuring total fluxes and their circular-polarization degrees at multiple frequencies. It has been instrumental in monitoring solar microwave emissions, contributing significantly to understanding solar flare mechanisms and other solar activities.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-term monitoring of solar activity
- **Time Range**: Continuous monitoring, with specific focus on data from June 1, 1994, to the present for the study
- **Wavelength(s)**: Corresponding to frequencies 1, 2, 3.75, 9.4, 17, 35, and 80 GHz
- **Physical Observable**: Microwave fluxes and their circular polarizations
- **Additional Comments**: The study utilizes data primarily at 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz due to the impact of weather conditions on higher frequencies. Data at 1 GHz were excluded from some analyses due to contamination from nonthermal sources.

### Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - These spacecrafts provide critical data for solar studies, including EUV flux measurements and magnetic field data, which are essential for correlating with microwave observations.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of EUV fluxes and magnetic fields
- **Time Range**: Continuous data collection with specific periods noted for calibration and comparison with microwave data
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) wavelengths and visible light for magnetic field measurements
- **Physical Observable**: EUV fluxes and magnetic field strengths
- **Additional Comments**: Data from SOHO's SEM (Solar EUV Monitor) and SDO's HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) are used. SEM data required corrections for sensor degradation over time.

### Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES satellites are equipped with X-ray sensors that provide valuable data for solar activity studies, particularly in understanding flares and their correlation with microwave emissions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: X-ray flux monitoring
- **Time Range**: Data used from the same periods as microwave observations for direct comparison
- **Wavelength(s)**: X-ray
- **Physical Observable**: X-ray fluxes
- **Additional Comments**: The X-ray data are crucial for correlating with microwave emissions during non-flaring periods to understand the baseline solar activity.

These instruments collectively provide a comprehensive set of data that allows for a detailed analysis of the relationships between microwave emissions and other indicators of solar activity. The study's findings are pivotal in extending these relationships to understand stellar activities in other solar-type stars.
