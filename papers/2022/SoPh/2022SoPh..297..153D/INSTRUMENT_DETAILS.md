## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents observations of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave originating from the active region NOAA 12887 on 28 October 2021. The study focuses on the wave's impact on neighboring loops, analyzing the event using data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) with its Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) and COR1 instruments. The paper discusses the wave's components, including fast-mode parts, oscillations in nearby loops, and wave trains, as well as non-wave phenomena like stationary fronts. The study also computes the density ratio inside and outside the loops and the magnetic field strength, finding that the EUV wave propagates ahead of the CME leading edge.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA observes the full Sun in multiple wavelengths, providing high spatial and temporal resolution data crucial for analyzing the EUV wave and its effects on coronal loops.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For the present study, we use the data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012), which observes the full Sun in seven EUV (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335 Å), two ultraviolet (UV) (1600 and 1700 Å), and one white light (4500 Å) channels."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the EUV wave and its evolution
- **Time Range**: 15:00 UT – 15:50 UT on 28 October 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The appearance of the EUV wave is at approximately 15:25 UT in AIA 193 Å... The EUV wave front is visible on the solar surface up to 15:50 UT and travel to the maximum distance of ≈1000′′ from its origin site."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335 Å (EUV channels)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The pixel resolution and cadence of EUV AIA observations are 0.6′′ and 12 sec, respectively. In this study, we use all EUV channels except 304 Å."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV wavefronts, wave trains, and loop oscillations
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The wave components include: the fast–mode part of the EUV wave event, creation of oscillations in nearby loops, and the appearance of wave trains."

### Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI provides a different viewpoint of the event, observing the solar corona up to 1.7 Rsun, which is essential for comparing the EUV wave with the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For a different viewpoint of the event, we use data from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A: Kaiser et al., 2008) EUVI telescope in 195 Å wavelength, which observes the solar corona until 1.7 Rsun."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the EUV wave and its association with the CME
- **Time Range**: 15:00 UT – 15:46 UT on 28 October 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The EUV wave was observed by the STEREO-A EUVI telescope in 195 Å and the corresponding CME was registered by the COR1 coronagraph... Four co-temporally over plotted images are displayed in Figure 4."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "EUVI telescope in 195 Å wavelength, which observes the solar corona until 1.7 Rsun."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV wavefronts and CME leading edge
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Along with the assumption of circular evolution of the EUV wave and the spatial evolution of co-aligned and combined images, we infer that the EUV wave looks to move just ahead of the COR1 field-of-view (FOV) CME."

### COR1 on board Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A)
- **General Comments**:
   - COR1 observes the solar corona from 1.5 to 4 Rsun, providing crucial data for analyzing the CME associated with the EUV wave.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The EUVI observes the Sun up to 1.7 Rsun and COR1 observes the Sun after 1.5 Rsun."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the CME associated with the EUV wave
- **Time Range**: 15:31 UT – 15:46 UT on 28 October 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The EUV wave was observed by the STEREO-A EUVI telescope in 195 Å and the corresponding CME was registered by the COR1 coronagraph... Four co-temporally over plotted images are displayed in Figure 4."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraph)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "COR1 observes the Sun after 1.5 Rsun."
- **Physical Observable**: CME leading edge
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Along with the assumption of circular evolution of the EUV wave and the spatial evolution of co-aligned and combined images, we infer that the EUV wave looks to move just ahead of the COR1 field-of-view (FOV) CME."

### Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO provides data on the CME's propagation in the outer corona, essential for understanding the relationship between the EUV wave and the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For the associated CME, the data from the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995) and the STEREO-A COR1 (Thompson et al., 2003) instruments are investigated."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the CME associated with the EUV wave
- **Time Range**: 15:48 UT – 16:24 UT on 28 October 2021 (C2), 16:06 UT onwards (C3)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "An associated halo CME, originated from this AR, appeared in LASCO C2 FOV at 15:48 UT at a height of 3.45 Rsun. The leading edge of the CME remains in C2 FOV upto 16:24 UT. It appeared in C3 FOV around 16:06 UT at a height of 6.08 Rsun and was visible in its FOV for several hours."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraph)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO has two coronagraphs C2 and C3, whose field of view range from 2 to 6 Rsun and 3.7 to 30 Rsun, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: CME leading edge and shock front
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The C2 image reveals two structures: the diffuse one followed by the bright front. These two fronts are indicated by yellow and black arc drawings, respectively in Figure 6a. The yellow arc corresponds to the shock front and the black arc represents the CME leading edge."
