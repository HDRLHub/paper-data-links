## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on investigating the pre-eruptive magnetic properties at the footprints of erupting magnetic flux ropes (MFRs). The study analyzes 28 MFRs erupting within 45 degrees from the disk center from 2010 to 2015, using high-quality vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The research aims to identify the progenitors of MFRs and explore the magnetic characteristics associated with these progenitors before their eruptions. Key findings include the identification of significant non-neutralized electric currents in some MFRs and the observation of pre-eruptive dimmings at the footprints, which suggest the pre-existence of MFRs. The study also examines the evolution of conjugate dimmings and electric currents within the footprints, providing insights into the internal structure of MFRs and their formation mechanisms.
