## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the structure of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during their early eruption stages in the low corona as captured through extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) passbands and white‐light coronagraphs. By comparing the three-part appearance (a leading edge, a low-density zone and a filament or hot channel) seen in EUV images with the traditional three-part (bright front, dark cavity, bright core) appearance in white-light images, the study uses coordinated observations from several spacecraft. Data from multiple instruments—each with distinct field-of-view (FOV), wavelength sensitivity, and cadence—allow the authors to correlate structures recorded at specific times (with clear start and end times for some events) and demonstrate the evolution of solar eruptions from the low to high corona.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The AIA records the low corona with a FOV of 1.3 R⊙, a cadence of 12 s and a resolution of 0.′′6 per pixel across seven EUV passbands.
  - It plays a key role in capturing the early formation of the CME structure—revealing both cool (filament) and hot (hot channel) features.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “The AIA records the low corona with the FOV (ﬁeld of view) of 1.3 R⊙, cadence of 12 s and resolution of 0.′′6 per pixel in seven EUV passbands.” (Section 2)

  - **Supporting Quote**: “Panel (a2) is accompanied by an animation that displays the filament eruption process from 19:40 UT to 20:10 UT with a duration of 2 seconds.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 1(a2) presents the AIA 193 ˚A running-difference image …”
- **Physical Observable**: Filament structure early in the CME evolution.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “… which demonstrates that the event already possesses the three-part appearance in the early stage, i.e., the leading edge as marked with blue dots, the ﬁlament as denoted with the red arrow …”

#### Data Collection Period 2: 2015 February 09 – Hot Channel Eruption
- **Time Range**: 22:50 UT to 23:14 UT on 2015 February 09

- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å (for the leading edge) and 131 Å (for the hot channel)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 1(b2) is a composite observation of AIA 193 ˚A running-difference image (gray) and 131 ˚A direct image (cyan)…”

#### Data Collection Period 3: 2017 September 10 – Hot Blob Observation
- **Time Range**: A key detail is provided at 15:55 UT (specifically, an image at 15:55:06 UT is used to capture the hot blob outline)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Due to the AIA limited FOV, partial blob and the leading edge are not imaged by the AIA at 15:55:30 UT. We acquire the blob outline based on the observation at 15:55:06 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å (sensitive to high-temperature structures)
- **Physical Observable**: The hot blob, which later evolves into the CME core.
  - **Additional Comments**: Although the 2014 January 06 event also used AIA 193 Å images to record a filament eruption, no explicit start–end time is mentioned there.
