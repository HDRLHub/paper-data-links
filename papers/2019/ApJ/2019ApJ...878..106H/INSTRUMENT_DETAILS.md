## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the evolution of a global extreme‐ultraviolet (EUV) wave associated with a CME‐driven shock on 2017 September 10. Using multi‐spacecraft observations, the study determines how the EUV wave interacts with various coronal structures—including coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), dim regions, bright points (BPs), and filament channels—and examines its connection with the CME‐driven shock. The data span observations in multiple EUV wavelengths from different vantage points, revealing that the primary EUV wave (observed from ∼15:50 UT to ∼16:30 UT) and the later transmitted waves (starting around 16:06 UT and fading out after 17:00 UT) together cover nearly a 360° extent on the Sun. Instruments on board SDO, STEREO-A, GOES-16, SOHO, and ground-based facilities (GONG) are employed, each contributing critical imaging and coronagraph data to examine the wave’s propagation, speed changes, and morphological connection to the CME-driven shock.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmo­spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA captures high-resolution EUV images in multiple wavelength bands (e.g., 211 Å, 193 Å, 171 Å, and 304 Å) that are pivotal for tracking the evolution of the EUV wave and its interactions with coronal structures. It provides running-difference images that clearly reveal the propagation of the primary and transmitted EUV waves.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The running-difference (RD) image of AIA 211 Å (Figure 1c) shows that the EUV wave was propagating on the western solar disk away from the flare site (indicated by arrow ‘A’) at 16:11 UT.”
   - “The primary EUV wave lasted about 40 minutes from ∼15:50 UT to ∼16:30 UT, and the transmitted waves started around 16:06 UT and faded out after 17:00 UT.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Primary EUV Wave Observation
- **Time Range**: 15:50 UT – 16:30 UT on 2017 September 10
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The primary EUV wave lasted about 40 minutes from ∼15:50 UT to ∼16:30 UT…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily 211 Å, with additional support from 193 Å and 171 Å channels.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “RD images of AIA 211, 193, and 171 Å are synthesized to red-green-blue color images…”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity disturbances indicating the propagation of a fast-mode wave/shock across the solar corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “An EUV wave is a large-scale intensity disturbance propagating in the corona…”
- **Additional Comments**: The high cadence and multi-wavelength capabilities of AIA allowed detailed tracking of the wavefront as it interacted with various coronal structures such as CHs, ARs, and dim regions.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Transmitted Wave Observation through Polar Coronal Holes
- **Time Range**: Approximately 16:06 UT – 17:00 UT on 2017 September 10
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CH transmitted EUV waves appear ∼15 minutes later than the primary wave and persist for over 50 minutes.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Again, observed in the 211 Å band (with correlated behavior in 193 Å and 171 Å) as detailed in the running-difference images.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The running-difference images of AIA 211 Å…”
- **Physical Observable**: The transmitted EUV wavefronts propagating along the boundaries of the north- and south-polar CHs.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…the EUV wave is reﬂected and also transmitted by both the north- and south-polar CHs.”
- **Additional Comments**: The high-resolution imagery from AIA enabled the identification of additional features such as accelerated EUV waves inside a low-density dim region with closed magnetic fields, as well as wave deflection by a bright point (BP).

### 2. Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory A (STEREO-A)
- **General Comments**:
