## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on evaluating global coronal models by comparing them with multiple independent observational datasets. The main objective is to assess the accuracy of these models in representing the Sun's atmosphere, particularly in predicting the distribution of coronal holes and the topology of the heliospheric current sheet. The study uses data from the first three perihelia of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and compares model predictions with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, white-light Carrington maps, and in situ magnetic sector structure measurements. The paper examines Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models, Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) models, and Magnetohydrodynamics Around a Sphere (MAS) models, focusing on their performance across different metrics.
