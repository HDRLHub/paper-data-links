This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the context provided, focusing on the instruments and their configurations during the observation periods mentioned. The queries are constructed to retrieve data from the GOES SUVI for EUV features at 195 Å, LASCO for white-light observations of the corona, and SDO for EUV observations at 171 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å. The results of these queries are printed, and the data download commands are commented out, as per the directive.
