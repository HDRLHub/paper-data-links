## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed observational analysis of a homologous extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event that occurred on 2012 May 14 from active region AR11476. Four narrow, arc‐shaped EUV waves were observed within one hour (08:45:00 to 09:45:00 UT) to propagate along a large transequatorial loop system. The event was accompanied by weak micro‐flares, recurrent coronal jets, and radio type III bursts, with one jet additionally associated with a small jet‐like CME. The study utilizes high temporal and high spatial resolution observations from multiple instruments to analyze the kinematics and propagation characteristics of both the EUV waves and the jets. These observations are used to support the interpretation that the EUV waves are large‐amplitude nonlinear fast‐mode magnetosonic waves or shocks, directly driven by the associated coronal jets.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - Provides full-disk images of the chromosphere and corona in seven EUV and three UV-visible channels. Its high temporal (12 seconds for EUV, 24 seconds for UV-visible) and spatial (0.6 arcsecond per pixel) resolution allowed detailed tracking of the EUV waves and coronal jets.
   - It captures the dynamic evolution of the eruptions, EUV wavefronts, and associated dimming regions.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The SDO/AIA provides full-disk images of chromosphere and corona in seven EUV and three UV-visible channels, spanning a temperature range from approximately 2 × 10^4 K to in excess of 20 × 10^6 K. The pixel size of the AIA images is 0′′.6, and the cadences of the EUV and UV-visible images are 12 and 24 seconds, respectively.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Observing the EUV waves and jets on 2012 May 14
- **Time Range**: 08:45:00 UT to 09:45:00 UT on May 14, 2012
   - **Supporting Quote**: “On 2012 May 14, four recurrent coronal jets occurred in NOAA active region AR11476 (N09, W47) within about one hour from 08:45:00 to 09:45:00 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily 171 Å and 304 Å (among others)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the EUV waves are displayed in the AIA 171 Å running difference images” and “the four recurrent jets are displayed in AIA 304 Å direct images.”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity variations revealing wavefronts, jet structures, dimming regions, and the associated plasma features.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The four EUV waves showed as narrow arc-shaped bright features … and the dark dimming region behind each EUV wave can be identified in the running difference images.”

- **Additional Comments**: The AIA’s high cadence and resolution were critical for determining the kinematics (speeds and decelerations) of the fast EUV waves as well as the temporal relationships with the associated micro-flares and jets.

### 3. Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO Ahead (STEREO-A)
- **General Comments**:
   - Provides full-disk EUV images in multiple channels (notably 304 Å and 195 Å) from a different vantage point (~115° separation from SDO during this event). The instrument’s lower spatial (1.58 arcsecond per pixel) and temporal resolutions (5 minutes for 195 Å and 10 minutes for 304 Å) complement the high-resolution AIA observations by capturing large-scale structures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “STEREO-A also takes full-disk EUV images in four channels. We use the 304 and 195 Å images in the present study. The pixel size of the STEREO EUV images is 1′′.58, while the cadences of the 195 Å and 304 Å images are 5 and 10 minutes, respectively.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Supplementary observation of EUV waves and jets on 2012 May 14
- **Time Range**: Implicitly during the event on 2012 May 14 (around the same period 08:45:00 UT to 09:45:00 UT), although the exact observation window isn’t separately specified.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å and 304 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the third and the fourth EUV waves were also observed by the STEREO-A from the other view angle… in the 195 Å running difference images.”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity changes showcasing wavefronts and the largest jet.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The wavefronts of the third and the fourth waves can be clearly observed in the 195 Å running difference images” and “only the largest jet (the fourth one) can be identified (see the arrow in Figure 3 (c) and (e)).”

- **Additional Comments**: STEREO-A observations reinforce the event’s three-dimensional structure, especially highlighting the wave and jet morphology from a different line of sight.

### 5. COR1 Coronagraph on board STEREO-A
- **General Comments**:
   - Similar to LASCO C2, the STEREO-A/Cor1 coronagraph observed the white-light signatures of coronal ejecta. It provided an independent check for the presence of a jet-like CME linked to the fourth jet.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In addition, the white-light images taken by... STEREO/Cor1 ahead coronagraphs are also used.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Detecting the jet-like CME in the fourth event
- **Time Range**: Around the time of the fourth jet on 2012 May 14, corresponding with LASCO C2 observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the jet-like CME associated with the fourth jet was also detected by STEREO/Cor1.”
