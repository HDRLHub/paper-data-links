## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study analyzes a peculiar interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event in August 2018 that caused a strong magnetic storm at Earth. The authors use a combination of global cosmic-ray data and in situ solar wind and magnetic field measurements to deduce the spatial distribution of high-energy cosmic rays and to infer details of the magnetic flux rope (MFR) associated with the ICME. The primary observational data come from the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN), which measures muon count rates in multiple directional channels, and from the Wind spacecraft, which provides solar wind plasma and magnetic field measurements. Additional instruments (the LASCO coronagraph on SOHO, the Global Data Assimilation System, and the DST index from Kyoto) provide complementary observations of the CME onset, atmospheric corrections for the muon data, and geomagnetic disturbances, respectively.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN) – Ground-Based Network
- **General Comments**:
   - The GMDN is a network of four multidirectional muon detectors located at Nagoya (Japan), Hobart (Australia), Kuwait City (Kuwait), and São Martinho da Serra (Brazil). These detectors record muon count rates in 60 directional channels covering almost the entire sky, and they are used to derive the cosmic-ray density (I₀(t)) and anisotropy (ξ(t)) at a representative primary rigidity of about 60 GV.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The GMDN, which is designed for accurate observation of the GCR anisotropy, comprises four multidirectional muon detectors, ‘Nagoya’ in Japan, ‘Hobart’ in Australia, ‘Kuwait City’ in Kuwait and ‘São Martinho da Serra’ in Brazil, recording muon count rates in 60 directional channels viewing almost the entire sky around Earth.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: August 2018 ICME Event**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 24 August 2018 00:00 UT to 27 August 2018 12:00 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Figure 2 shows the GCR density, anisotropy and density gradient at 60 GV obtained from our analyses of the GMDN data for 24-27 August, 2018.”
   - **Physical Observable**: Cosmic-ray density variations (I₀(t)) and directional anisotropy vectors (ξ(t)) derived from muon count rate deviations.
   - **Additional Comments**: The analysis uses 10-minute count rate deviations averaged hourly, and the derived observables serve to constrain characteristics of the magnetic flux rope and the cosmic-ray modulation during the ICME.

### 2. Wind Spacecraft – In Situ Solar Wind Observations
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind spacecraft provides measurements of solar wind parameters including plasma properties and magnetic field vectors. Its data are used to identify key features of the ICME such as the interplanetary shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic flux rope (MFR).
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Both the magnetic field and plasma data are observed by the Wind spacecraft and time-shifted to Earth’s location.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: August 2018 ICME Solar Wind Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 24 August 2018 to 27 August 2018 (as depicted in Figure 1)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Figure 1 summarizes solar wind parameters measured in an ICME over four days between 24 and 27 August, 2018.”
   - **Physical Observable**: Solar wind velocity (Vₛw), proton density, proton temperature, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude and orientation, and geomagnetic DST index (derived in conjunction with ground-based measurements).
   - **Additional Comments**: The Wind spacecraft data underpin the identification of the IP-shock at 03:00 UT on 25 August and delineate the magnetic flux rope period (14:10 UT on 25 August to 09:09 UT on 26 August).

### 3. LASCO Coronagraph on board the SOHO Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO coronagraph, mounted on the SOHO satellite, is used to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by imaging the solar corona. In this study, it provided the initial detection of the CME responsible for the ICME event.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...this ICME event is caused by a CME eruption recorded at 21:24 UT on 20 August by the LASCO coronagraphs on board the SOHO satellite.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME Eruption Observation**
   - **Time Range**: 21:24 UT on 20 August 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: (as above)
   - **Physical Observable**: The white-light imaging of a CME, which indicates the eruption from the solar corona.
   - **Additional Comments**: The timing of the CME eruption is essential for understanding the propagation delay and dynamics of the subsequent ICME observed near Earth.

### 4. Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) – Atmospheric Correction Data
- **General Comments**:
   - The GDAS provides the vertical profile of atmospheric temperature, which is utilized to correct the muon count rates for local atmospheric pressure and temperature effects.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...after correcting for local atmospheric pressure and temperature effects. For our correction method of the atmospheric effects using the on-site measurement of pressure and the mass weighted temperature from the vertical profile of the atmospheric temperature provided by the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) of the National Center for Environmental Prediction...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Atmospheric Correction during Cosmic-Ray Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Although not explicitly stated, GDAS data were applied for the period corresponding to the cosmic-ray data analysis (notably during the ICME event in August 2018 and for the 27-day reference period between 12 August and 7 September 2018).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (as above)
   - **Physical Observable**: Atmospheric temperature profiles used for adjusting muon detector data.
   - **Additional Comments**: These adjustments are critical to reduce systematic errors in the cosmic-ray density and anisotropy analysis.

### 5. DST Index (Provided by the WDC for Geomagnetism, Kyoto)
- **General Comments**:
   - The DST (Disturbance Storm Time) index is a measure of the geomagnetic disturbance level and is used to quantify the intensity of magnetic storms. It is provided by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism in Kyoto.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...a significant southward ﬁeld is recorded in the MFR causing a gradual decrease of the DST index of geomagnetic ﬁeld down to the minimum of -174 nT at 06:00 on 26 August (panel e)(http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.html).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Geomagnetic Storm Monitoring**
   - **Time Range**: During the ICME event with a notable minimum at 06:00 UT on 26 August 2018 (with data spanning the same period as the solar wind and cosmic-ray measurements, i.e. 24–27 August 2018).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (as above)
   - **Physical Observable**: The DST index reflects variations in the geomagnetic field and helps in diagnosing the severity of the storm.
   - **Additional Comments**: The DST index is used in conjunction with the solar wind and cosmic ray data to provide a comprehensive view of the geoeffective disturbances.
