# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This theoretical paper develops a model for the acceleration and flux accretion of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through magnetic reconnection. The work compares different reconnection scenarios – including the tether‐cutting and breakout models – and quantifies how the reconnection‐induced changes in Lorentz forces (via reduction of downward magnetic tension and enhancement of the hoop force) can modify CME dynamics. In doing so, the paper also draws on observational data – such as measurements of CME masses, speeds, and reconnected magnetic fluxes – that have been compiled from various instruments and catalogs. Several datasets are referenced to support empirical correlations, including CME catalogs spanning multi–decadal time ranges and specific satellite observations of flare emission and coronal features.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SOHO LASCO Coronagraph (LASCO C1)
- **General Comments**:
  - The LASCO C1 coronagraph was designed to provide white–light coronagraphic images that captured the morphology and dynamics of CME eruptions. It operated as part of the SOHO mission and provided observations of coronal structure until the instrument failed.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “using data from the LASCO C1 coronagraph (Brueckner et al. 1995) before it failed”  
    *(This indicates the use of LASCO C1 data prior to its failure; no explicit observation dates are provided in the text.)*
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided; it is noted only that the instrument was used until it failed.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observables**:
  - **Wavelength(s)**: White-light observations of the solar corona.
  - **Physical Observable**: Coronal brightness and structure used to determine CME morphology, speed, and mass.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Although the exact operational dates are not given in the excerpt, LASCO C1 played a key role in early CME characterization.

### 2. CDAW CME Catalog (Based on LASCO Observations)
- **General Comments**:
  - The CDAW CME catalog aggregates measurements of CME masses, linear speeds, and related parameters compiled from LASCO coronagraph observations. It serves as an important database for statistical studies and model comparisons in the paper.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “For the N = 17792 CMEs with masses and linear speeds listed in the catalog’s text version from 1996 Jan - 2016 May, …”
    *(This quote establishes the time range and data volume used from the catalog.)*
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: January 1996 – May 2016.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observables**:
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Based on white–light coronagraph images.
  - **Physical Observable**: CME mass, linear speed, and angular width.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The catalog’s extensive temporal coverage provides a statistical basis for correlating CME kinematics with reconnected magnetic flux.

### 3. GOES X-ray Detectors
- **General Comments**:
  - The GOES satellites are equipped with X-ray detectors that monitor the Sun’s soft X-ray emission. In this work, they provide flare radiative flux measurements that are compared with CME dynamics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “the associated GOES curves show a rise time of a bit less than 20 minutes, implying momentum transfer…”
    *(This statement relates the time evolution of soft X-ray emission to the acceleration phase of a CME.)*
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: The excerpt does not specify an absolute date range; however, the GOES X–ray channels (specifically the 1–8 Å band) continuously monitor solar flares. The quoted rise time of “a bit less than 20 minutes” refers to the flare event evolution.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observables**:
  - **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å (soft X–ray band).
  - **Physical Observable**: Flare radiative flux used as a proxy for magnetic reconnection rates during CME events.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The GOES observations are used to infer the relationship between flare energy release and CME acceleration.

### 4. STEREO Observations
- **General Comments**:
  - The STEREO mission provides stereoscopic observations of the Sun and the heliosphere. In the context of this study, STEREO data were used in a statistical comparison of CMEs showing distinct versus weak low–coronal signatures (LCSs).
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “In a study of 34 events with STEREO, Ma et al. (2010) found that about 1/3 had no LCSs, and that the speeds of their stealth events were typically slow…”
    *(This quote demonstrates that STEREO data were instrumental in identifying different CME populations.)*
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: The specific dates are not provided in the excerpt.
- **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observables**:
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Although the excerpt does not list exact wavelengths, STEREO’s EUV and white–light coronagraph channels are typically used to observe coronal features.
  - **Physical Observable**: Evaluation of CME presence or absence of low–coronal signatures and associated kinematics.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - STEREO observations contribute to the discussion on the distinction between typical and “stealth” CMEs based on their observable signatures.
