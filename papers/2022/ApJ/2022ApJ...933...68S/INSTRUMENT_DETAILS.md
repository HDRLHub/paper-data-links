# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the three-part structure of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs), focusing on the eruption of a coronal prominence cavity on October 7, 2010. Observations were made from two perspectives: edge-on from Earth and face-on from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). The study aims to provide a unified explanation for the three-part structure of CMEs, which includes a bright front, dark cavity, and bright core. The research highlights the role of both prominences and magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) in forming the CME core, using data from multiple instruments to analyze the event.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA was used to image the corona in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands, focusing on the coronal cavity and prominence.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The event is analyzed with multiple instruments, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observing the coronal cavity and prominence
- **Time Range**: October 7, 2010, from 03:19:34 UT onward
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Panel (a) shows the prominence recorded by AIA 304 ˚A prior to eruption at 03:19:34 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å and 304 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The 193 ˚A and 304 ˚A passbands are used to analyze the coronal cavity and prominence, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal cavity and prominence
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The prominence approximately locates at the cavity bottom, while seems a little lower because the cavity tube is curvy circling the solar surface..."
- **Additional Comments**: The AIA provides high temporal cadence (12 s) and spatial resolution (1.2′′).

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO was used to observe the three-part CME structure in the outer corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: "...the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observing the three-part CME
- **Time Range**: October 7, 2010, from 07:24:05 UT onward
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME first appears in the C2 FOV at 7:24:05 UT and its linear speed is 417 km s−1 (CDAW1)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "CMEs often exhibit a typical three-part structure in the white-light coronagraphs..."
- **Physical Observable**: Three-part CME structure (bright front, dark cavity, bright core)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The eruption of coronal cavity leads to a three-part CME that is observed by the LASCO as shown in Panel (c)..."
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO covers a large field of view (FOV) ranging from 1.1 to 30 R⊙.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) and White-light Coronagraphs (COR1 and COR2) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI and COR instruments were used to observe the prominence and CME from a face-on perspective.
- **Supporting Quote**: "...as well as the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) and white-light coronagraphs (COR1 and COR2) of Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al. 2008) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser 2005)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observing the prominence and CME
- **Time Range**: October 7, 2010, from 09:46:15 UT onward
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Panel (a) presents the erupting prominence imaged by the EUVI 304 ˚A at 09:46:15 UT..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å and 195 Å (EUV), White-light (COR1 and COR2)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The left part in each frame of the animation (accompanying Panels (a)–(e)) displays the MFR eruption taking away the prominence together from 07:00 UT to 15:00 UT with a composite observations of EUVI (304 and 195 ˚A), COR1, and COR2..."
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence and three-part CME structure
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME also possesses a three-part structure in the FOVs of both COR1 and COR2 as shown in Panels (c) and (d)."
- **Additional Comments**: EUVI has a FOV of 1.7 R⊙, partially overlapping with COR1 (1.4–4 R⊙), enabling seamless observation from the solar surface to the outer corona.
