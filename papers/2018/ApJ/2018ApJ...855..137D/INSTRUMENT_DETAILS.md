## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study introduces and applies a new method for automated detection and characterization of coronal dimming regions on the Sun, phenomena linked with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The research focuses on two well-observed dimming events, on 6 September 2011 and 26 December 2011. The observational basis for all analysis is high-cadence, multi-wavelength extreme ultraviolet (EUV) image sequences and magnetic field data. For EUV imaging, the seven filter channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) were directly used, covering a broad plasma temperature range. Analysis of underlying magnetic properties relies on line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), also aboard SDO. The paper consistently details data collection periods, wavelengths, and observables, with event contexts anchored precisely to the time ranges of the two studied eruptions. The findings are derived exclusively from data collected by SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI within the specified event windows; no other instruments are used for analysis.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The AIA instrument provided the multi-wavelength EUV image data used for detecting and analyzing coronal dimming regions. All seven EUV filters were used to generate logarithmic base-ratio images, core/secondary dimming identification, and brightness characterization for both case study periods.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We use high-cadence (12 s) data from seven different extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) covering a temperature range of ≈50, 000 −1.0 × 107 K."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SOL2011-09-06T21:45 to SOL2011-09-07T09:45 (Event: 6 September 2011, X2.1 flare/CME)
- **Time Range**: 2011-09-06T21:45 UT – 2011-09-07T09:45 UT (12-hour series, with 30 min pre-flare start [2011-09-06T22:16])
  - **Supporting Quote**: "our time series covers 12 hours, starting 30 minutes before the associated flare. For the first two hours the full-cadence (12 s) observations of SDO/AIA are used, while for the remaining time series the cadence of the observations is successively reduced to 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. This setting allows us to study the impulsive phase of the dimming in great detail as well as its recovery phase later on."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 335 Å, 94 Å, 131 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We use high-cadence (12 s) data from seven different extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) covering a temperature range of ≈50, 000 −1.0 × 107 K. The 171, 193, 211 Å channels represent plasma at quiet Sun temperatures (0.6–2 MK), while 335, 94 and 131 Å are sensitive to hot plasma of active regions and flares (up to 10 MK). The temperature response function of the 304 Å filter peaks at ≈50,000 K and plasma at this temperature is likely to origin from the transition region and chromosphere."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal and chromospheric emission in EUV; intensity changes (dimmings) associated with CME-related plasma evacuation
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Coronal dimmings are regions of reduced extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) emission in the low corona... Their appearance is in general interpreted as density depletion caused by the evacuation of plasma during the CME lift-off..."
- **Additional Comments**: Both core and secondary dimming regions are detected, with spatial evolution resolved by using cumulative dimming masks in each channel.

#### Data Collection Period 2: SOL2011-12-26T10:46 to SOL2011-12-26T22:46 (Event: 26 December 2011, C5.7 flare/CME)
- **Time Range**: 2011-12-26T10:46 UT – 2011-12-26T22:46 UT (12-hour series, including 30 min pre-flare start [2011-12-26T11:16])
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The coronal dimming that occurred on 26 December 2011... event... our time series covers 12 hours, starting 30 minutes before the associated flare."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 335 Å, 94 Å, 131 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We use high-cadence (12 s) data from seven different extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA...)"
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal dimming signatures; expansion and recovery of low corona and transition region plasma associated with the eruption
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The dimming event occurred on December 26, 2011... in association with a partial halo CME observed by SOHO/LASCO with an average speed of about v=740 km s−1. The associated C5.7 flare started at 11:16 UT... The evolution of the dimming region related to the associated flare and CME has already been studied in detail in Cheng & Qiu (2016) and Qiu & Cheng (2017)."
- **Additional Comments**: Detection algorithm is identically applied; cumulative masks and brightness/intensity evolution are calculated for the full event interval.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/HMI LOS magnetograms provide the surface magnetic field measurements (720 s cadence) underpinning all magnetic flux and polarity analyses related to the detected dimming regions during both event windows.
- **Supporting Quote**: "To study the magnetic properties of coronal dimming regions, the 720 s line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) are used. The data is rebinned to 2048 × 2048 pixels under the condition of flux conservation."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SOL2011-09-06T21:45 to SOL2011-09-07T09:45 (Event: 6 September 2011, X2.1 flare/CME)
- **Time Range**: 2011-09-06T21:45 UT – 2011-09-07T09:45 UT (aligned with imaging/EUV series)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "To study the magnetic properties of coronal dimming regions, the 720 s line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) are used."

  - **Supporting Quote**: "To study the magnetic properties of coronal dimming regions, the 720 s line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI...) are used."
- **Additional Comments**: Magnetograms are rebinned for flux conservation; core dimming and total dimming region magnetic analyses stem directly from these data.

  - **Supporting Quote**: "To study the magnetic properties of coronal dimming regions, the 720 s line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of the SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI...) are used."
