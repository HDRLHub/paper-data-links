produce the script. Given the context provided, which lacks specific details about instruments, time ranges, wavelengths, and physical observables, we must construct a general script that can be adapted once more specific information is available. The script will focus on querying solar data using generic parameters that are commonly used in solar physics research. We will use SunPy's Fido interface to demonstrate how one might set up queries for hypothetical instruments and time ranges, keeping in mind that these should be replaced with specific details once they are known.
