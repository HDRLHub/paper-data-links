produce the script. We need to construct queries for the SWAN instrument on the SOHO satellite to retrieve data for the specified periods and wavelengths related to the observations of the comets C/2020 S3 (Erasmus), C/2021 A1 (Leonard), and C/2021 O3 (PanSTARRS). Given the context, we will focus on the hydrogen Lyman-alpha wavelength at 1215.6 Ã…, which is crucial for studying the hydrogen comae and water production rates of these comets. The queries will be structured to cover the specific time ranges mentioned for each comet observation period.
