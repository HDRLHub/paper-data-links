## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents an update to the PreMevE model (now PreMevE-2E) for forecasting ultra-relativistic (≥2 MeV) electron flux distributions in Earth’s outer radiation belt. The model leverages machine learning and ensemble forecasting to predict both integral and differential electron fluxes across a 1289-day period starting from February 20, 2013. Forecast inputs include in-situ electron measurements, low-energy precipitating electrons from low-Earth-orbit satellites, and upstream solar wind parameters. Multiple instruments from different platforms (RBSP, LANL GEO, NOAA POES, and solar wind monitors) provide the observational data that underlie these forecasts.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Relativistic Electron-Proton Telescope (REPT) on board RBSP-a
- **General Comments**:
   - REPT provides in-situ measurements of ultra-relativistic electron fluxes (>2 MeV) across L-shell values up to about 6.
   - These measurements serve as the primary target observations for training, validating, and testing the forecasting models.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Ultra‐relativistic electron flux distributions are from the in-situ observations made by Relativistic Electron‐proton Telescope (REPT, Baker et al., 2012) experiment aboard RBSP‐a spacecraft at L ≤ 6."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1:
- **Time Range**: 1289-day interval starting from February 20, 2013.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "integral fluxes of >2 MeV electrons are the target data set that is a function of L‐shell over a 1289‐day interval starting from 2013 February 20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (instrument measures particle energy, not electromagnetic wavelengths).
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not provided.
- **Physical Observable**: Integral fluxes of ultra‐relativistic electrons (>2 MeV).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "integral fluxes of >2 MeV electrons..."
- **Additional Comments**: Measurements cover a range of L-shells up to approximately L = 6 and are critical for understanding electron dynamics in the outer radiation belt.

### 2. Energy Spectrometer for Particles (ESP) on board LANL-01A GEO Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - ESP is used for measuring electron fluxes at geosynchronous orbit (GEO), specifically at L = 6.6.
   - Its data complements the REPT observations by providing additional measurements at GEO, where in-situ data are directly available.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "and by Energy Spectrometer for Particles (ESP, Meier et al., 1996) instrument carried by one Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) GEO satellite LANL-01A at L = 6.6."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1:
- **Time Range**: 1289-day interval starting from February 20, 2013.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Although the ESP-specific time stamp is not separately stated, it is implied that its measurements span the same 1289‐day interval as the REPT data.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not provided.
- **Physical Observable**: Ultra‐relativistic electron fluxes (≥2 MeV) at GEO.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Instrument data contribute to the target set used for forecasting >2 MeV electron flux distributions.
- **Additional Comments**: ESP measurements are essential for model calibration at geosynchronous conditions where electron fluxes are notably enhanced.

### 3. NOAA POES NOAA-15 (Polar Operational Environmental Satellite)
- **General Comments**:
   - NOAA-15 POES provides observations of low-energy precipitating electrons in low-Earth orbit.
   - It contributes key input parameters for the forecasting models by recording electron count rates in several energy channels.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Model input parameters include low‐energy precipitating electrons measured by one NOAA Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) NOAA‐15..."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1:
- **Time Range**: 1289-day interval starting from February 20, 2013 (with data binned in 5‐hr intervals).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "All panels present for the same 1289‐day interval starting from 2013/02/20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; instead, the instrument classifies electrons by energy thresholds.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "E2, E3, and P6 refer to the count rates of >100, >300, and >1000 keV electrons from different POES channels."
- **Physical Observable**: Count rates of precipitating electrons in three energy channels:
   - E2: >100 keV electrons.
   - E3: >300 keV electrons.
   - P6: >1000 keV electrons.
- **Additional Comments**: The data provided by NOAA-15 are integral to capturing the precipitating electron dynamics that indirectly inform the model’s predictions.

### 4. Upstream Solar Wind Monitors (OMNI Data Set)
- **General Comments**:
   - These monitors record upstream solar wind conditions, supplying critical parameters such as solar wind speeds and densities.
   - Such solar wind data are key input features that help to characterize the magnetospheric environment influencing electron dynamics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "upstream solar wind conditions include the speeds... and solar wind densities (SWD) from solar wind monitors" as well as "Solar wind speeds measured upstream of the magnetosphere from the OMNI data set."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1:
- **Time Range**: 1289-day interval starting from February 20, 2013.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "All panels present for the same 1289‐day interval starting from 2013/02/20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not provided.
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind speeds and solar wind densities.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "upstream solar wind conditions include the speeds that have been tested in P2020, and solar wind densities (SWD) as the new model input parameter."
- **Additional Comments**: The solar wind data are standardized and binned along with electron data (every 5 hours) to synchronize the model’s inputs across the extensive observation period.
