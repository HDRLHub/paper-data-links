## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: 
  This paper reviews and compares five recent studies of solar flare energetics with a focus on how the thermal and nonthermal energy components are determined. The studies use multi‐wavelength observations from several space instruments to derive thermal parameters (via X‐ray imaging/spectroscopy, EUV imaging, and bolometric measurements) and to constrain the energy input by nonthermal electrons. In particular, the analyses make use of hard X‐ray spectral fits, soft X‐ray fluxes, and differential emission measure (DEM) reconstructions. Some studies (e.g. Stoiser et al. 2007) examine microflare events observed on 2003 September 26, while others investigate larger, M‐ and X‐class flares. Integration times for HXR spectra are mentioned (e.g. 12 s near the HXR peak in S+07 and 60 s in IC14), and flare “time bins” of approximately 20 s are employed in other studies. In addition, the paper discusses bolometric energy as derived from Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) measurements, highlighting the importance of multi-instrument constraints to resolve apparent discrepancies in the energy partition between thermal plasmas and accelerated particles.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI is used throughout the paper for obtaining hard X-ray (HXR) images and spectra. Its observations are central to the derivation of both thermal parameters (through isothermal fits) and the nonthermal electron energetics via thick‐target modeling.
   - It is applied in several studies (S+07, E+12, IC14, WM16, A+17/A+19) to characterize flare energetics.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The thermal parameters were derived from isothermal fits to Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) HXR spectra at the ﬂare peaks.” 
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Microflare Study (S+07)
- **Time Range**: Events observed on 2003 September 26; individual HXR spectra were obtained with an integration time of about 12 seconds around the HXR peak.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Stoiser et al. (2007... derived thermal and nonthermal energies for 18 microﬂares ... that occurred within a single active region on 2003 September 26.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hard X-rays (typical spectral energy range used for HXR imaging and spectroscopy; exact energy bands are not specified but the term HXR implies energies likely in the tens of keV and above).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “... by thick-target fits to the nonthermal part of the photon spectrum…”
- **Physical Observable**: HXR photon flux and spectral shapes used both for fitting the thermal component (via isothermal parameters) and to constrain the accelerated electron populations.
- **Additional Comments**: Other studies (e.g. E+12, WM16) used RHESSI data segmented into time bins (∼20 s) or longer integration times (e.g. 60 s in IC14) to study flares of different classes.

### 2. GOES (Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellites)
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES provides measurements of the soft X-ray (SXR) flux and is used in conjunction with RHESSI to derive thermal parameters such as temperature and emission measure via isothermal fits.
   - It is especially useful for capturing the overall SXR light curve and peak flux of flares across a wide range of GOES classes (from A/B up to M and X).
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...isothermal ﬁts to the GOES ﬂuxes…”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: General Flare Observation
- **Time Range**: Continuous SXR coverage over the duration of each flare event. Although no explicit UT start and end times are provided, the instrument’s nearly uninterrupted monitoring ensures that all phases of flares (from rise to peak to decay) are captured.
   - **Supporting Context**: The paper discusses background-subtracted GOES peak fluxes and uses these fluxes for events spanning from microflares (e.g. 2003 September 26 in S+07) to large X-class flares.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray wavelengths (typically in the 1–8 Å channel, although the specific channels are not detailed in the text).
- **Physical Observable**: SXR flux (which correlates with the temperature and emission measure of the thermal plasma).
- **Additional Comments**: GOES-derived parameters are used both on their own and in combination with RHESSI-derived values to derive “combined” thermal energies.

### 3. TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer)
- **General Comments**:
   - TRACE is employed for high-resolution imaging of the solar atmosphere at ultraviolet wavelengths and is used in this context to identify and measure the footpoint brightenings associated with flare loops.
   - These brightenings aid in estimating the geometry (loop length and cross-sectional area) needed to compute the thermal source volume.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...foot‑point brightenings observed at 1600 Å by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE; Handy et al. 1999)...”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Microflare Study (S+07)
- **Time Range**: Observations corresponding to the microflare events on 2003 September 26.
   - **Supporting Context**: The same day’s events as described in Stoiser et al. (2007) are used to derive the volume from TRACE-observed 1600 Å brightenings.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å (ultraviolet).
- **Physical Observable**: UV footpoint brightenings which inform the spatial extent (areas and separations) necessary for estimating the flaring loop’s geometry.
- **Additional Comments**: TRACE data contribute exclusively to the volume determination in S+07 by assuming a semicircular loop geometry.

### 4. SDO/AIA (Solar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging Assembly)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA instrument provides high-resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images in multiple coronal wavelength channels. It is used to obtain flux measurements that constrain the differential emission measure (DEM) of the flare plasma.
   - Its observations support the derivation of multithermal plasma characteristics in studies such as Inglis & Christe (2014) and Aschwanden et al. (2017, 2019).
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...EUV ﬂuxes from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012).”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: DEM Reconstructions for M– and X‑class Flares
- **Time Range**: Although explicit start and end times are not provided, AIA observations are used during the flares analyzed in the multithermal studies (typically observed post-2010, covering events spanning the impulsive and gradual phases of M- and X-class flares).
   - **Supporting Context**: AIA images in six coronal EUV wavelengths are used to perform spatial synthesis DEM reconstructions.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Six coronal EUV wavelengths (specific channels not listed, but they typically include wavelengths such as 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 335 Å, etc.).
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission used to derive the temperature and density distribution (DEM) of the flaring plasma.
- **Additional Comments**: The AIA observations are combined with RHESSI X-ray data in the studies to constrain both the hot and the cooler thermal components.

### 5. SORCE/TIM (Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment – Total Irradiance Monitor)
- **General Comments**:
   - SORCE/TIM measures the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), which is used to derive the bolometric (total radiative) energy emitted in solar flares. This is critical as an independent check on the total energy budget.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Based on total solar irradiance (TSI) observations obtained from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft…”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Bolometric Energy Determinations for Large Flares
- **Time Range**: While no explicit universal start/end times are provided, TIM data have been employed for individual large X‑class flares (as in Woods et al. 2006) and to compare with bolometric energies derived from flare ensembles.
   - **Supporting Context**: TIM measurements are referenced in studies of X‑class flares.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Full spectral (bolometric) coverage across all wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**: Total radiated energy (TSI) which serves as a proxy for the total energy released in a flare.
- **Additional Comments**: The use of TIM data allows comparison of the directly observed bolometric energy with the energetics derived via X-ray and EUV observations.

### 6. SOHO/VIRGO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory – Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations)
- **General Comments**:
   - VIRGO observes TSI fluctuations and is used in superposed epoch analyses to extract average bolometric energies over ensembles of flares. This provides an alternative and complementary bolometric measure to those obtained from SORCE/TIM.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...TSI light curves provided by the Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instrument aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Ensemble Analysis for Bolometric Energies
- **Time Range**: The VIRGO data are analyzed using the superposed epoch method, centering individual flare light curves. Although exact UT times are not specified, the method is applied to flare ensembles ranging from X‑class down to C‑class events as described by Kretzschmar (2011).
   - **Supporting Context**: This method averages TSI light curves to overcome solar p-mode variations and extract bolometric energy signals.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Broad spectral range covering near-UV, white-light, and near-IR components.
- **Physical Observable**: Changes in TSI related to flare bolometric energy output.
- **Additional Comments**: VIRGO’s bolometric measurements provide an important independent constraint to assess the total energy released in flares.
