## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses observations of the hydrogen comae of three long-period comets: C/2020 S3 (Erasmus), C/2021 A1 (Leonard), and C/2021 O3 (PanSTARRS), using the SWAN all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the SOHO satellite. The observations occurred in 2021 and 2022. The study focuses on the water production rates of these comets, calculated from nearly daily full-sky images. The paper highlights the disintegration of comets C/2021 O3 and C/2021 A1 shortly before and after their perihelion, respectively, and compares their behaviors with the more typical behavior of comet C/2020 S3. The findings contribute to understanding the dynamics and physical characteristics of comets as they approach the sun.

## Instrumentation Details

### SWAN on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - SWAN (Solar Wind ANisotropies) is an all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera used to observe the hydrogen comae of comets. It provides nearly daily full-sky images of the hydrogen Lyman-alpha distribution, which helps in studying the interaction between solar wind, solar ultraviolet fluxes, and interstellar hydrogen.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of comet C/2020 S3 (Erasmus)
- **Time Range**: 28 October 2020 – 5 December 2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen Lyman-alpha
- **Physical Observable**: Hydrogen coma and water production rates
- **Additional Comments**: Observations ceased a week before perihelion due to observational constraints.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Further observations of comet C/2020 S3 (Erasmus) post-perihelion
- **Time Range**: 19 January 2021 – 13 February 2021
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen Lyman-alpha
- **Physical Observable**: Hydrogen coma and water production rates
- **Additional Comments**: Observations resumed post-perihelion and continued on most days until mid-February.

#### Data Collection Period 3: Observations of comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) pre-perihelion
- **Time Range**: 1 October 2021 – 29 December 2021
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen Lyman-alpha
- **Physical Observable**: Hydrogen coma and water production rates
- **Additional Comments**: Daily observations were made until the comet was too close to the Sun to observe.

#### Data Collection Period 4: Observations of comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) post-perihelion
- **Time Range**: 11 January 2022 – 3 February 2022
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen Lyman-alpha
- **Physical Observable**: Hydrogen coma and water production rates
- **Additional Comments**: Observations resumed after perihelion and continued almost daily.

#### Data Collection Period 5: Observations of comet C/2021 O3 (PanSTARRS)
- **Time Range**: 6 April 2022 – 24 April 2022
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen Lyman-alpha
- **Physical Observable**: Hydrogen coma and water production rates
- **Additional Comments**: The comet was observed most days from early to mid-April. Observations indicate the comet likely disintegrated between 5 and 10 April.
