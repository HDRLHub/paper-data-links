# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper re-examines long-lived horizontal flow features on the solar surface—originally interpreted as signatures of giant convective cells—by analyzing nearly two decades of observations. The study focuses on near-surface horizontal flows derived using independent methods (ring-diagram analysis and local correlation tracking) and compares these flows with magnetic activity signatures. Data from both ground-based and space-based observatories have been employed, spanning a wide range of dates. By correlating the flows with magnetic maps and comparing rotation rates, the authors conclude that the observed east-west flow correlations, with lifetimes of several months, are predominantly due to active region inflows rather than to convection.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG++) – Ring-Diagram Analysis (RDA)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is ground-based and produces full-disk horizontal flow maps through its RDA pipeline. The GONG++ data are used to derive near-surface horizontal flows (with flow components in the direction of rotation, ux, and northward, uy) from 15° tiles. The analysis focuses on flows at various depths; in particular, measurements at 2 Mm (the shallowest depth provided by the pipeline) are used.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “From the former, we utilize the 19 years of horizontal flows derived from the GONG++ ring-diagram analysis (RDA) pipeline from 2001 - 2020.”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: Extended 19-Year Flow Mapping**
   - **Time Range**: 2001 – 2020
      - **Supporting Quote**: “From the former, we utilize the 19 years of horizontal flows derived from the GONG++ ring-diagram analysis (RDA) pipeline from 2001 - 2020.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated.
      - **Supporting Quote**: [No specific wavelength details provided.]
   - **Physical Observable**: Near-surface horizontal flows (ux and uy) and divergence maps.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “For each of these data sets we have both of the horizontal flow components; in the direction of rotation, ux, and in the direction of the solar north pole, uy.”
   - **Additional Comments**: Data are obtained from 15° tiles, and the RDA measurements include depth information (with the shallowest layer at 2 Mm).

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is a space-based instrument providing detailed Doppler and magnetic data on the Sun. In this study, two types of data from HMI are utilized: one set processed via ring-diagram analysis (RDA) and another set derived from local correlation tracking (LCT) of granules. Additionally, tracked magnetograms produced by HMI (using the mTrack5 routine) are compared with the flow maps to assess the role of magnetic activity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “From the latter instrument, we use 8 years of RDA data from 2010-2018, and 6 years (2010-2016) of surface horizontal flow data derived from the local correlation tracking (LCT) of granules by Löptien et al. (2018).”

- **Data Collection Period 1 (HMI RDA)**:
   - **Time Range**: 2010 – 2018
      - **Supporting Quote**: “From the latter instrument, we use 8 years of RDA data from 2010-2018…”

   - **Additional Comments**: The RDA maps are compared with data from other instruments and used in spectral and auto-correlation analyses.

- **Data Collection Period 2 (HMI LCT)**:
   - **Time Range**: 2010 – 2016
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…and 6 years (2010-2016) of surface horizontal flow data derived from the local correlation tracking (LCT) of granules…”

      - **Supporting Quote**: [No specific wavelength information provided.]
   - **Physical Observable**: Surface horizontal flows measured by tracking granulation patterns.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…local correlation tracking (LCT) of granules…”
   - **Additional Comments**: To remove small-scale features, the LCT maps are smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian (σ = 7.2°).

- **Additional HMI Magnetogram Details**:
   - **Time Range**: Overlapping the HMI flow data period; specifically used during periods compared with magnetic activity.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “For comparison with magnetic activity, we track MDI and HMI magnetograms…”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not provided (magnetograms are typically obtained in a photospheric absorption line, but no details are given).
   - **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field (unsigned magnetic field maps).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…the corresponding magnetic maps show that these flows are related to activity.”
   - **Additional Comments**: Magnetograms are sampled at a cadence of 96 minutes and tracked using the mTrack5 routine.

### 3. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI is a space-based instrument that provides Dopplergrams of the solar surface. It was the first to capture long-lived velocity features in space-based Doppler data, which were later re-examined in this study.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “It was not until the availability of data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft that Beck et al. (1998) detected long-lived large-scale velocity features.”

- **Data Collection Period 1**:
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 16 months (commonly associated with the period 1996 – 1997)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Beck et al. (1998) [used] a 16 month time series of Dopplergrams from space…” (Note: Exact dates are not provided in the text, but the 16-month period is indicated.)
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated.
      - **Supporting Quote**: [No wavelength details are provided in the text.]
   - **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity signals representing large-scale flow features.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…Beck et al. (1998) detected long-lived large-scale velocity features…”
   - **Additional Comments**: The detected features were noted to have an e-folding lifetime of approximately 126 days and to be elongated in the longitudinal direction.

### 4. Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO)
- **General Comments**:
   - Data from the Mount Wilson Observatory were used in early studies that examined surface Doppler images. These historical observations contributed to the discussion on the existence (or non-detection) of giant convective cells.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In examining surface Doppler images from Mount Wilson observatory, Labonte et al. (1981)…”

   - **Additional Comments**: These observations, along with later work (e.g., Snodgrass & Howard 1984), provided early context for the debate on large-scale solar convection.
