## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the association between solar flares and the Hale Sector Boundary (HSB), a magnetic structure defined by the polarity change in the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). The researchers compare the timing and locations of HSBs, identified by two methods: (1) extrapolation from sector boundary crossings detected at the Earth, and (2) potential field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations of photospheric magnetograms. The primary observational dataset is the RHESSI X-ray flare list, encompassing 73,711 flare events from 12 February 2002 to 23 February 2016, covering both Solar Cycles 23 and 24. This dataset provides accurate timing and spatial information for solar flares, which are cross-referenced with calculated HSB locations and active longitude positions based on sunspot data. The findings rely fundamentally on the RHESSI observations for flare positions and magnitudes, alongside PFSS data products based on SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI photospheric magnetograms for mapping magnetic structures.

## Instrumentation Details

### Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) on board RHESSI Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:  
  RHESSI is the sole source of direct solar flare detections and positional information for this study. The data are drawn from the RHESSI X-ray flare list, filtered and validated as detailed in Appendix A. RHESSI’s capabilities allow the study of X-ray flares from X-class down to A-class, with location and GOES-class magnitude determined for each event. Only RHESSI data are used to determine flare occurrence, spatial association with HSBs, and distributions across solar cycles and hemispheres.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We use a modified version of the flare list found by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. (2002)), filtering out non-solar or dubious events. The full details of this approach, and resulting checks of the list, are given in Appendix A."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full study period for flare–HSB association
- **Time Range**: 12 February 2002 – 23 February 2016  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Our filtered list contains 73,711 events over 12 February 2002 (when RHESSI began observations) up to 23 February 2016. These 14 years of flare positions cover the maximum and the declining phase of Cycle 23, through solar minimum and then the rising, maximum and declining phases of Cycle 24."
- **Wavelength(s)**: X-rays (RHESSI energy coverage; also cross-referenced with GOES 1–8Å X-rays for magnitude)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The flares for this study were found using the X-ray observations of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager RHESSI (Lin et al. 2002)."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar flares detected in X-rays, with positional and magnitude information  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Significantly, RHESSI also provides spatial information about the flares, which is time encoded in its light curves via the Rotation Modulation Collimators in front of the detectors (Hurford et al. 2002)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  Flare magnitudes are background-subtracted GOES classes, calculated for each RHESSI event; spatial association and latitude/longitude are used extensively in HSB proximity analyses.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each flare we calculate the GOES 1-8Å background subtracted flux by finding the maximum GOES flux between the RHESSI flare start and end time."

### SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI Magnetograms Processed Using Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) Model
- **General Comments**:  
  PFSS magnetic field maps, derived from SOHO/MDI (for pre-2010) and SDO/HMI (post-2010) full-disk photospheric magnetogram data, are used to compute the large-scale neutral lines (sector boundaries) at the Sun's source surface. These are used in the second method for HSB identification (HSB PFSS), providing daily positional information at all longitudes and latitudes, and are directly compared with RHESSI flare coordinates.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The model and magnetic data products used in this paper were created by M. DeRosa and K. Schrijver, and available online2 from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI (post-2010) magnetograms, generated routinely at 6-hour intervals. Using a daily PFSS at 12:04 UT we take the radial magnetic field component on the outermost surface, for this model at 2.5R⊙."

#### Data Collection Period 1: PFSS coverage for study interval
- **Time Range**: Daily, 12 February 2002 – 23 February 2016  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The model and magnetic data products used in this paper were created by M. DeRosa and K. Schrijver, and available online2 from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI (post-2010) magnetograms, generated routinely at 6-hour intervals. Using a daily PFSS at 12:04 UT..."

    "PFSS extrapolations of photospheric magnetograms. The model and magnetic data products used in this paper were created by M. DeRosa and K. Schrijver, and available online2 from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI (post-2010) magnetograms..."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (longitudinal and latitudinal structure, radial component); PFSS extrapolated neutral lines (sector boundaries) at 2.5 solar radii  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Using a daily PFSS at 12:04 UT we take the radial magnetic field component on the outermost surface, for this model at 2.5R⊙. In these we can easily identify the location of the neutral line and then for a given latitude determine the longitude at which the magnetic polarity changes in the same way as the leading-to-following sunspots polarity in each hemisphere."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  The PFSS method allows for HSB identifications at all times and heliographic latitudes, enabling full-statistics comparisons with RHESSI flares.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Although the HSB-Earth approach in §2 is well established and simple, it is dependent on the ballistic assumption about the solar wind speed to map the HSB back to the Sun. It can also only provide the times the HSBs were at central meridian, and without any latitude information. To be able to identify the HSBs at all times, and hence for all flares, we instead develop a new approach using Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS)..."

**No other instruments were directly used for data collection or analysis. All results about solar flare locations and timing are based exclusively on RHESSI data, cross-referenced with PFSS extrapolations based on SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI magnetograms.**
