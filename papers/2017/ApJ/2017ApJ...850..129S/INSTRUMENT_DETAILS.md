## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates turbulent density fluctuations and the associated proton heating rates in the solar wind at heliocentric distances from 9 to 20 solar radii (R⊙). The primary data comprises scatter-broadened images of the Crab nebula at 80 MHz, acquired as the nebula transited near the Sun during June 9–22 in the years 2016 and 2017. These radio images, obtained using the Gauribidanur RAdioheliograPH (GRAPH), are central to estimating the density modulation index (δNe/Ne) and proton heating rates. Complementary context images of the solar corona from the LASCO coronagraphs onboard the SOHO spacecraft are used for identifying coronal structures (e.g., streamers) intersecting the line of sight during these observations. The results and findings of the paper are directly built upon the analysis of these datasets, with the observational periods and event context specified for each instrument's use.

## Instrumentation Details

### Gauribidanur RAdioheliograPH (GRAPH)
- **General Comments**:
  - Primary instrument for collecting the radio images of the Crab nebula used to measure anisotropic angular broadening caused by turbulent density fluctuations in the solar wind. The data directly forms the basis for the calculation of structure functions, turbulence amplitude (C2N), density modulation index, and solar wind proton heating rates.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The radio data were obtained with the Gauribidanur RAdioheliograPH (GRAPH; Ramesh et al. (1998); Ramesh (2011)) at 80 MHz during the local meridian transit of the Crab nebula."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Imaging during heliocentric transit in 2016 and 2017  
- **Time Range**: June 9–22, 2016 and June 9–22, 2017, during local meridian transit
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of turbulent density fluctuations and associated solar wind heating rate from 9 −20 R⊙using the anisotropic angular broadening of radio observations of the Crab nebula from June 9 to 22 in 2016 and 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 80 MHz (radio)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The radio data were obtained with the Gauribidanur RAdioheliograPH (GRAPH; Ramesh et al. (1998); Ramesh (2011)) at 80 MHz during the local meridian transit of the Crab nebula."
- **Physical Observable**: Anisotropic scatter broadening of Crab nebula due to turbulent density fluctuations in the solar wind
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We obtain scatter-broadened images of the Crab nebula at 80 MHz as it transits through the inner solar wind in June 2016 and 2017. These images are anisotropic, with the major axis oriented perpendicular to the radially outward coronal magnetic field. Using these data, we deduce that the density modulation index (δNe/Ne) caused by turbulent density fluctuations in the solar wind ranges from 1.9 ×10−3 to 7.7 ×10−3 between 9 - 20 R⊙."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Images are used to produce visibilities and structure functions with the longest baseline (2.6 km) for turbulence analysis.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The images of the Crab nebula in Figure 2 are obtained by combining the visibilities from all the baselines available in the GRAPH. We are interested in the turbulent density fluctuations at the inner scale, which is the scale at which the turbulent spectrum transitions from a power law to an exponential turnover. This is typically the smallest measurable scale; we therefore compute the structure function corresponding to the longest available baseline (s = 2.6 km), since that corresponds to the smallest scale."
  - Occultation by coronal streamers is analyzed, and streamer crossing events are identified via comparative days.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "On 17 June 2016, 17 and 18 June 2017, a coronal streamer was present along the line of sight to the Crab nebula; this gives us an additional opportunity to study streamer characteristics."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Simultaneous frequency comparison for scaling test
- **Time Range**: Specific observations in June 2016 (exact dates not explicitly given, but simultaneous with 80 MHz observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Although we show 80 MHz observations in this paper, we also have simultaneous observations at 53 MHz. The structure function (equation 5) is proportional to the square of the observing frequency (i.e., Dφ(s) ∝λ2). This predicts that the ratio of the structure functions at 80 and 53.3 MHz should be 0.44. Our observations yield a value of 0.43 for this ratio, and are thus consistent with the expected scaling."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 53 MHz and 80 MHz (radio)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Although we show 80 MHz observations in this paper, we also have simultaneous observations at 53 MHz."
- **Physical Observable**: Frequency scaling of scatter broadening in the solar wind
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The structure function (equation 5) is proportional to the square of the observing frequency (i.e., Dφ(s) ∝λ2). This predicts that the ratio of the structure functions at 80 and 53.3 MHz should be 0.44. Our observations yield a value of 0.43 for this ratio, and are thus consistent with the expected scaling."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Used to empirically validate the expected frequency dependence of the structure function.

### LASCO Coronagraphs (C2, C3) onboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for obtaining white light images of the solar corona for context, specifically to identify the existence and position of coronal streamers along the line of sight to the Crab nebula during the radio observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We have used white light images of the solar corona obtained with the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Brueckner et al. 1995) for general context, and to identify features like coronal streamers."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Context images for streamer identification
- **Time Range**: June 17, 2016, 06:30 UT (C3) and June 17, 2016, 06:36 UT (C2)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Figure 1 shows the white light images of the solar corona obtained with the LASCO C3 (left) and C2 (right) coronagraphs on 17 June 2016. The black features in both inverted grey scale images are coronal streamers. ... On 17 June 2016, the Crab nebula was observed through a streamer in the south-west quadrant. The streamer was associated with an active region NOAA 12555 located at heliographic coordinates S09W71."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We have used white light images of the solar corona obtained with the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Brueckner et al. 1995)..."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal streamers and general coronal structure
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The black features in both inverted grey scale images are coronal streamers."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The images are used exclusively for establishing the presence and position of streamers along the line of sight; they do not contribute quantitatively to the turbulence or heating calculations.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Tracking the Crab nebula's projected heliocentric distances
- **Time Range**: June 8–21, 2016
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The location of the Crab nebula between 8 and 21 June 2016 is marked by the red circles on the LASCO C3 images."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We have used white light images of the solar corona obtained with the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)..."
- **Physical Observable**: Crab nebula’s solar elongation path relative to coronal features
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The small circles superposed on the image represent the location of the Crab nebula on different days during the period 8 June 2016 to 21 June 2016."
