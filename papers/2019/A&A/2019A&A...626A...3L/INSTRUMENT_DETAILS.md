## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates solar Rossby waves (r modes) by applying time-distance helioseismology to measure the subsurface north–south flows along the solar equator. It combines data from two spaceborne instruments – SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI – to create a continuous 21‐year record from May 1996 to April 2017. The study uses medium-ℓ Dopplergrams, on which a band‐pass frequency filter (2–5 mHz) is applied to isolate p-mode oscillations. The resulting south–north travel-time shifts are used to probe the internal dynamics of the Sun over two solar cycles, with particular attention to the detection and characterization of global Rossby waves.

### 1. SOHO/MDI on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/MDI provides medium-ℓ Dopplergrams that capture the solar surface velocity field.
   - These observations are essential for the time-distance helioseismology analysis, particularly in measuring south–north travel-time shifts that are sensitive to subsurface flows.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "We use medium-ℓ Dopplergrams taken by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI covering the period from May 1996 to April 2017."
   - "The MDI data used in this work span from May 1996 to April 2010."

#### Data Collection Period: Observation with SOHO/MDI
- **Time Range**: May 1996 12:00:00_TAI – April 2010  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The MDI data used in this work span from May 1996 to April 2010" and "t0 = 1 May 1996 12:00:00_TAI."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - A band-pass frequency filter isolates p-mode oscillations in the 2–5 mHz range. While a specific spectral line is not detailed in the text, the instrument’s Doppler measurements imply observations in a photospheric spectral line.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...a band-pass frequency filter is further applied to isolate the p modes within 2 – 5 mHz."
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - The primary observable is the Doppler shift in the solar surface, which is used to compute south–north travel-time differences. These travel-time shifts serve as a proxy for subsurface north–south flows.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The south-north travel-time shift in this work is defined as δτ = τs − τn" and the discussion regarding measuring these shifts over travel distances from 6° to 30° underlines this observable.
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - Instrument-specific corrections, such as updates to the instrument roll angle (CROTA2) and solar tilt angle (CRLT_OBS), are applied to the MDI data to reduce systematic errors (e.g., annual variations due to center-to-limb effects).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "corrections to both the instrument roll angle and the solar tilt angle B0 are needed..." (Appendix A.1).

### 2. SDO/HMI on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI provides medium-ℓ Dopplergrams similar in nature to those from MDI but benefits from updated calibration procedures that minimize systematic errors.
   - The HMI observations extend the data record from May 2010 to April 2017, complementing the earlier MDI data to form a continuous 21‐year dataset.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "We use medium-ℓ Dopplergrams taken by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI covering the period from May 1996 to April 2017."
   - "HMI data span from May 2010 to April 2017."

#### Data Collection Period: Observation with SDO/HMI
- **Time Range**: May 2010 12:00:00_TAI – April 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "t(3) = 1 May 2010 12:00:00_TAI." and "HMI data span from May 2010 to April 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - Although the paper does not specify the precise wavelength for HMI observations, it applies the same band-pass frequency filter (2–5 mHz) to isolate the solar p modes. In general practice, HMI observes in the Fe I 6173 Å line.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a band-pass frequency filter is further applied to isolate the p modes within 2 – 5 mHz." (with the understanding that HMI typically uses the Fe I 6173 Å line).
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - SDO/HMI measures the Doppler shift of the solar photosphere to capture the velocity field. These measurements are processed to extract south–north travel-time shifts, which are indicative of subsurface north–south flows.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The south-north travel-time shift in this work is defined as δτ = τs − τn, where τn and τs are the northward and southward travel times..."
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - SDO/HMI data incorporate calibration enhancements; for example, the CROTA2 (instrument roll angle) correction is set to zero since the HMI team has already calibrated this value.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the HMI team had calibrated and updated the value of CROTA2" and the combined use of MDI and HMI data helps bridge the 21-year observation period.
