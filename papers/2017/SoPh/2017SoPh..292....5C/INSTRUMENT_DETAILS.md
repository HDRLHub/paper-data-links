## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper presents a comprehensive statistical study of the properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the temporal and spatial correlation between solar flares and CMEs over Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The primary research is based on direct analysis of observational data collected by the LASCO-C2 and LASCO-C3 coronagraphs onboard SOHO from 31 July 1997 to 31 March 2014, providing parameters such as CME speed, acceleration, mass, and angular width. The study uses two CME catalogs: the manually curated CDAW catalog and the automated CACTus catalog, both relying on data from LASCO. Additionally, the work includes direct use of flare observations made by GOES satellites, specifically C-, M-, and X-class flares, for the exact same period, as reported by the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). The results and relationships between CME properties and flare fluxes presented in the paper are derived solely from direct analysis of these primary datasets. 

## Instrumentation Details

### LASCO-C2 and LASCO-C3 Coronagraphs on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - Data from these coronagraphs is the fundamental source for all CME measurements presented, including speed, acceleration, polar angle, angular width, and mass. The analysis covers nearly 17 years, fully spanning Solar Cycles 23 and 24. Both the CDAW and CACTus CME catalogs, used as primary data sources in this work, are derived from these instruments.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The CMEs data used in this work were acquired by LASCO-C2 and -C3 coronagraphs onboard SOHO during about 17 years (from 31 July 1997, to 31 March 2014). We used the CDAW Data Center online CME catalog, which is available at the following link: cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list and the catalog obtained by the Computer Aided CME Tracking software (CACTus), which is available at the following link: sidc.oma.be/cactus/ The use of both catalogs allowed us to compare the results from manual identification of CMEs (CDAW) and automatic tracking of CMEs (CACTus)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Comprehensive CME Survey of Solar Cycles 23 and 24
- **Time Range**: 1997-07-31 – 2014-03-31 (Full dataset used for statistical analysis and all key results)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The CMEs data used in this work were acquired by LASCO-C2 and -C3 coronagraphs onboard SOHO during about 17 years (from 31 July 1997, to 31 March 2014)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (CME detection, not a specific spectral band)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    [No explicit wavelength quote in the text; LASCO is a white-light coronagraph, but only factual extraction is permitted.]
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections: speed, acceleration, polar angle, angular width, mass, energy, distribution with solar latitude, temporal occurrence.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The CDAW catalog contains information on several CMEs parameters, such as their central polar angle (PA), i.e. the mean angle between the two outer edges of the CME width measured counterclockwise from Solar North in degrees on the plane of the sky, the linear velocity, the acceleration, the width, the mass, and the energy."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Both the CDAW and CACTus catalogs, core to all analyses and figures, are built directly from LASCO data covering every event and statistical distribution described.

### GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites)
- **General Comments**:
  - The GOES satellites directly provided soft X-ray flare data (C-, M-, X-class) spanning the entire observation period. Flare properties such as start, peak, end time, integrated flux, and location are derived from this data and are directly analyzed in all flare-related portions of the paper.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We also considered 19,811 flares of C-, M-, and X-class that occurred during the same time interval were observed by GOES. We used the reports of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/) to collect the main information, such as the time of the beginning, maximum, and end of each flare, the GOES X-ray class and the integrated flux from the beginning to the end."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare Event Cataloging and CME-Flare Association Study
- **Time Range**: 1997-07-31 – 2014-03-31 (Entire period correlating with the CME study)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We also considered 19,811 flares of C-, M-, and X-class that occurred during the same time interval were observed by GOES."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.1–0.8 nm (Soft X-ray)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the flux of the flares integrated from their start to end in the 0.1 – 0.8 nm range."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar flare class (C, M, X), time series (start, peak, end), integrated X-ray flux, flare location (when available).
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We used the reports of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/) to collect the main information, such as the time of the beginning, maximum, and end of each flare, the GOES X-ray class and the integrated flux from the beginning to the end."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - GOES flare data were used both to analyze flare properties independently and to match (via timing and position) to CME events from LASCO, forming the basis for all correlation results.
