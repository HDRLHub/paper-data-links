## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the production and escape of highly fractionated plasma from a typical solar active region (AR 11150) by using remote spectroscopic measurements and magnetic field modelling. The work focuses on using the elemental abundance ratio Si/S as a diagnostic to trace plasma that has been confined in closed coronal loops and might later be accelerated as solar energetic particles (SEPs) or contribute to the slow solar wind. The study combines observations from multiple instruments, including imaging, spectroscopic and magnetographic data, taken over the period during which AR 11150 crossed the solar disk (from 27 January 2011 to 10 February 2011). The paper also makes reference to earlier in-situ measurements from spacecraft such as Wind and ACE to provide context for the solar plasma composition.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
  - The Hinode/EIS is used for both Doppler velocity measurements and plasma elemental composition analysis. It observes key spectral lines such as Si X 258.375Å and S X 264.223Å, along with a range of Fe ion lines (from Fe VIII to Fe XXIV) and Ca and Mg diagnostic lines.
  - The instrument operates with a spectral resolution of 22 mÅ, and observations are performed in two wavelength bands (short-wavelength: 171–212Å and long-wavelength: 245–291Å). The observing sequence uses a 1″ slit with coarse 2″ steps over a 240″ x 512″ field-of-view with a 60-second exposure at each slit position.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “We used the Hinode/EIS for the Doppler velocity and plasma elemental composition analysis. EIS has a spectral resolution of 22mÅ and records EUV spectra in two short-wavelength (171—212Å) and long-wavelength (245–291Å) bands.”

### 2. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA provides high-cadence, high-resolution EUV images that capture the coronal structure of the Sun. Its multiple wavelength channels (including 171Å, 193Å, 211Å, and 94Å) allow the observation of plasma across a range of temperatures (0.9–7.1 MK). In this study, AIA images are coaligned with EIS data to correlate spectroscopic features with visible coronal structures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Figure 1. AIA images of AR 11150 observed on 2011, February 1... The images are formed at temperatures in the range of 0.9—-7.1 MK.”

- **Physical Observable**: Coronal loop structures, active region morphology, and overall EUV brightness.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The AIA images are used to coalign the EIS scans with the instruments’ solar coordinate information.”

### 3. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI provides line-of-sight magnetograms that are critical for mapping the magnetic field distribution on the solar surface. The magnetograms are used not only to understand the magnetic configuration of AR 11150 but also to serve as the lower boundary in the evolutionary magnetic field modelling.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “The magnetograms that are taken by HMI (Schou et al. 2012; Couvidat et al. 2016) contain the line-of-sight component of the magnetic ﬂux.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Initial Magnetic Field Measurement for Modelling
- **Time Range**: 29 January 2011 at 12:00 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The initial condition is constructed from the ﬁrst line-of-sight magnetogram in the sequence, which is taken on 2011, January 29, at 12:00 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)/Detector Specifics**: Broadband magnetographic measurements sensitive to the line-of-sight (radialized via cosine correction).
  - **Supporting Quote**: “To account for line-of-sight eﬀects we applied a cosine correction...”
- **Physical Observable**: Solar photospheric magnetic field and its evolution to drive coronal field modelling.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... used as the lower boundary condition in the simulations of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Regular Magnetogram Sequence for Magnetic Field Modelling
- **Time Range**: Cadence of 96 minutes over the AR observation window (specifically covering the period of 27 January to 10 February 2011 as part of the modelling process)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The simulations are performed using 40 line-of-sight magnetograms taken by SDO/HMI with a cadence of 96 minutes...”
- **Additional Comments**: These magnetograms were pre-processed through cleaning, flux balancing, and re-sampling procedures before being used in the time-dependent, data-driven coronal magnetic field simulations.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... cleaned using the clean-up procedures. The cleaned magnetograms are interpolated onto a 512² grid...”

### 4. Wind Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - The Wind spacecraft provided in-situ measurements of elemental abundance ratios (e.g., the Si/S ratio) that have been used in previous studies to trace SEPs back to their coronal sources. Although the current paper primarily examines AR 11150 through remote sensing, previous work using Wind data (notably for AR 11944) is referenced to compare in-situ plasma composition with remote EIS observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Brooks & Yardley (2021) used Si/S abundance ratios measured by the Wind spacecraft to trace the likely sources of several signiﬁcant SEP events...”
  
#### Data Collection Period: SEP Event Associations
- **Time Range**: January 2014 (for events observed in earlier related studies)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... several major SEP events in 2014, January, to speciﬁc features in the host active region (AR 11944).”
- **Wavelength(s)/Detector Specifics**: Not applicable (in-situ particle detectors measuring elemental abundances).
- **Physical Observable**: In-situ elemental composition, specifically the Si/S abundance ratio.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... the highest FIP bias was found closest to the region where the FIP eﬀect operates.”

### 5. ACE Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) observatory has been historically used for obtaining composition measurements, including Si/S data, that complement EIS observations. However, due to a hardware anomaly, S data from ACE became unavailable after August 2011.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “EIS composition measurements have been linked to Si/S data from the ACE observatory in the past (Brooks & Warren 2011), but a hardware anomaly on ACE occurred in 2011, August, and S data are no longer available.”
  
#### Data Collection Period: Historical Usage Prior to Anomaly
- **Time Range**: Prior to August 2011 (exact dates not specified; only the anomaly date is mentioned)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... a hardware anomaly on ACE occurred in 2011, August...”
- **Wavelength(s)/Detector Specifics**: Not detailed; ACE used onboard particle detectors for in-situ plasma composition.
- **Physical Observable**: Elemental composition (Si/S ratios) in the solar wind and SEP environments.
  - **Supporting Quote**: As referenced in the context of linking remote EIS measurements to in-situ composition data.
