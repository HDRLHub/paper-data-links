# This script, including code comments, was initially drafted by an AI model. Please use with caution.

```python
# Import necessary modules from SunPy
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for the SEP event observation
time_range = a.Time('2020-11-28', '2020-12-05')

# Define the instrument and source for the query
instrument = a.Instrument('ERNE')
source = a.Source('SOHO')

# Construct the query using the defined attributes
query = Fido.search(time_range, instrument, source)

# Print the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to download the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script is designed to query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for data from the SOHO/ERNE instrument during the specified time range of the SEP event, which is from November 28, 2020, to December 5, 2020. It prints the results of the query, allowing users to verify the available data before deciding to download it. The `Fido.fetch` command is included as a comment for users who wish to proceed with downloading the data after reviewing the query results.
