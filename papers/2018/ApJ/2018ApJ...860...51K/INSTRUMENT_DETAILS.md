## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a filament eruption associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) observed in-situ at L1 on August 5th, 2011 and tracked as a remote-sensing event from the low solar corona. A suite of instruments onboard multiple spacecraft (SDO, STEREO, SOHO, ACE, and others) were used to monitor different aspects of the eruption. High-cadence multi-wavelength extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from SDO/AIA were combined with EUV and white-light coronagraph images from the STEREO spacecraft and SOHO/LASCO, as well as in-situ composition measurements from ACE/SWICS. In addition, auxiliary observations from GOES and the Global High-Resolution H-alpha Network were utilized to constrain the source region and evolution of the filament and its related flare/CME activity. Detailed time-dependent diagnostics of plasma column density, temperature, density, speed, and ionization evolution were performed as the filament plasma traveled through the low corona.
