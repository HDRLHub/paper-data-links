## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the hemispherical asymmetry in solar torsional oscillation velocity and its relation to the sunspot cycle. The authors analyze 16 years of helioseismic data to study the north–south differences in zonal flow velocities measured in the near-surface layers of the Sun. The primary data source is the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Doppler images processed using ring diagram analysis (2001 July to 2017 March). The study is complemented by surface velocity measurements from the Mount Wilson Observatory (obtained using the Babcock magnetograph, with data from 1974 to 2012) and zonal flow measurements from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (data starting from August 2010 over a ~7‐year period). Historical reference is also made to observations made with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard SOHO, which first demonstrated helioseismic detection of the flows.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) – Ring Diagram Analysis Instrument
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument uses daily Dopplergrams from various GONG sites. The images are merged and remapped into 189 overlapping patches to perform ring diagram analysis, which extracts zonal (and meridional) flow velocities as a function of depth. The analysis primarily targets the near-surface layers of the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We use the zonal ﬂow velocity data obtained from GONG ring diagram analysis pipeline for the period 2001 July to 2017 March."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Main Torsional Oscillation Measurements
- **Time Range**: 2001 July – 2017 March
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…for the period 2001 July to 2017 March."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided (Doppler images are used, implying the use of spectral lines suitable for helioseismology).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The daily Dopplergrams from diﬀerent GONG sites are merged and remapped…" 
- **Physical Observable**: Torsional oscillation velocity in the near-surface layers.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…the zonal ﬂow velocities obtained by ring diagram analysis…"
- **Additional Comments**: Data are corrected for systematic effects including the B0-angle variation and then smoothed over one year to reduce random fluctuations.

### 2. Mount Wilson Observatory – 150 ft Tower with Babcock Magnetograph
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument provides full-disk surface velocity measurements using the Babcock magnetograph. It tracks the motions of magnetic features and is used here for calculating the hemispherical asymmetry in surface torsional oscillation velocity.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The surface velocity measurements obtained from the Mount Wilson 150 ft tower using the Babcock magnetograph…"
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Surface Velocity Measurements
- **Time Range**: 1974 – 2012
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…these data extends from 1974 to 2012."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No explicit wavelength mentioned in the context regarding Mount Wilson data.]
- **Physical Observable**: Surface torsional oscillation velocity; used to calculate hemispherical asymmetry.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…are used for calculating the hemispherical asymmetry at the solar surface…"
- **Additional Comments**: The measurements are based on tracking magnetic features and are compared with the near-surface oscillation velocities obtained from GONG.

### 3. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is used to derive zonal flow velocities from Doppler measurements using a ring diagram pipeline. The HMI data, corrected following methods similar to GONG, offer an independent measure of near-surface torsional oscillations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The zonal ﬂow derived from the ring diagram analysis of data obtained from HMI is also used for our analysis."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Doppler Velocity Measurements from HMI
- **Time Range**: August 2010 – (≈) July 2017 (covering about 7 years)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The data we consider here start from 2010 August and cover a period of about 7 yr…"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No explicit wavelength information given for HMI observations in the provided text.]
- **Physical Observable**: Near-surface zonal flow (torsional oscillation) velocity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…the asymmetry obtained from the HMI observations at 2 Mm…"
- **Additional Comments**: B-angle corrections are applied similarly as for the GONG data, and the data are smoothed over one year.

### 4. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI is mentioned as the instrument that first enabled helioseismic observations of solar flows through Doppler images. Although not used in the present analysis, it is referenced as part of the historical context leading up to modern helioseismic observations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Kosovichev & Schou (1997) were the ﬁrst to observe the ﬂow helioseismically using the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory…"

- **Physical Observable**: Helioseismic detection of solar torsional oscillation (zonal flow velocities).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…first to observe the ﬂow helioseismically…" 
- **Additional Comments**: MDI is referenced historically to underscore the evolution of helioseismic techniques from initial detections to the detailed studies performed with current instruments like GONG and HMI.
