## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper reports on the first simultaneous detection of a fast radio burst (FRB)-like signal and its hard X-ray counterpart from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 on April 28, 2020. Using data from multiple instruments operating in different energy bands—from radio (CHIME/FRB, STARE2) to hard X-rays (Konus-Wind, INTEGRAL, AGILE, Insight-HXMT)—the study shows that the radio and X-ray emissions are temporally coincident, with closely matching double-peaked structures. Detailed spectral and temporal analyses, including sub-millisecond radio pulse widths (∼0.6 and ∼0.3 ms) and X-ray emission recorded over ∼0.464 s (with key segments between T0−0.220 s and T0+0.244 s) in the 18–320 keV range, support the conclusion that these emissions likely share a common origin.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Konus‑Wind on board the NASA Wind Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - Konus‑Wind (KW) consists of two identical NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft. Each detector covers a wide field of view (2π sr) and is sensitive to incident gamma-ray/X‑ray photons over an energy range from 20 keV up to 16 MeV. In this study, KW recorded the hard X‑ray counterpart of the FRB-like burst from SGR 1935+2154.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The burst triggered KW at T0= 14:34:24.447 UT (geocentric time, see Methods)... Using a Bayesian block decomposition of the KW count rate in the 18–320 keV band (see Methods), we found the emission start and stop times to be T0 − 0.220 s and T0 + 0.244 s, respectively.”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: Full Burst Emission**
   - **Time Range**: From T0 − 0.220 s to T0 + 0.244 s (corresponding to 14:34:24.227 UT to 14:34:24.691 UT, Earth‑crossing time)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...we found the emission start and stop times to be T0 − 0.220 s and T0 + 0.244 s, respectively. The total duration of the burst is 0.464 s.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 18–320 keV measured in bands G1 (18–80 keV) and G2 (80–320 keV); overall gamma‑ray energy range up to 16 MeV.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The KW light curve (Figure 1) shows … measurements in the G1 (18–80 keV) and G2 (80–320 keV) energy bands…”
   - **Physical Observable**: Count rates, light curves, spectral energy distribution (fluence and peak flux) in hard X‑rays.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The KW photon energies measured during this event extend to beyond 250 keV… the total energy fluence S, measured in the 20–500 keV band…”
   - **Additional Comments**: Spectral measurements were performed in triggered mode starting at T0 with accumulation intervals (e.g., 0–0.064 s for the peak spectrum and 0–0.256 s for the time‑integrated spectrum).

- **Data Collection Period 2: Peak Emission Interval**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately from T0 − 0.060 s to T0 + 0.036 s (focusing on the brightest burst segment)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The brightest part of the event spans the interval between T0−0.060 s and T0+0.036 s and shows two prominent peaks, 0.016 s and 0.032 s wide, which overlap in time with the radio pulses.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Detected in the same energy bands as above.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the KW count rate in the 18–320 keV band…”
   - **Physical Observable**: Detailed temporal structure (double-peaked profile) intended for time correlation with the radio burst.
   - **Additional Comments**: This phase enabled the direct comparison of the X‑ray pulse timing with the de‑dispersed radio arrival times.

### 2. CHIME/FRB (Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment / Fast Radio Burst)
- **General Comments**:
   - CHIME/FRB, a dedicated fast radio burst detection instrument, recorded a bright millisecond‑scale radio burst from SGR 1935+2154. Its backend operates in the 400–800 MHz radio band.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The next day, at ≈14:34:33 UT, a bright, millisecond-scale radio burst... was detected by CHIME/FRB backend in the 400–800 MHz band. The CHIME/FRB light curve had a two‑peak structure with two components, ∼0.6 ms and ∼0.3 ms wide…”
   
- **Data Collection Period 1: Radio Pulse Detection**
   - **Time Range**: The two radio components occurred at de‑dispersed geocentric arrival times of approximately 14:34:24.42650 UT and 14:34:24.45547 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…the position of their maxima in the KW 18–80 keV light curve (14:34:24.427 and 14:34:24.455, respectively) coincide with the de‑dispersed geocentric arrival times of the two radio pulses, reported by CHIME/FRB…”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 400–800 MHz.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...detected by CHIME/FRB backend in the 400–800 MHz band.”
   - **Physical Observable**: Fast radio bursts characterized by pulse widths of ∼0.6 ms (first component) and ∼0.3 ms (second component).
   - **Additional Comments**: The fine temporal structure allowed for stringent comparisons with the X‑ray burst detected by KW.

### 3. STARE2
- **General Comments**:
   - STARE2 is a radio detection experiment that observed fast radio burst activity. In this event, it independently detected the second radio pulse in the 1.4 GHz band.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Independently, the second pulse was detected by STARE2 in the 1.4 GHz band, with the intrinsic duration of ∼0.6 ms.”
   
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: The detection is temporally associated with the KW and CHIME/FRB bursts (occurring essentially around the same time as the de‑dispersed arrival of the second radio pulse at ∼14:34:24.455 UT).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...which overlap in time with the two radio pulses.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 1.4 GHz.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...detected by STARE2 in the 1.4 GHz band…”
   - **Physical Observable**: A fast radio pulse with an intrinsic duration of ∼0.6 ms.
   - **Additional Comments**: STARE2’s detection reinforces the radio counterpart identification by providing an independent measurement at a higher radio frequency.

- **General Comments**:
   - INTEGRAL is a space‑borne gamma‑ray observatory that also recorded the hard X‑ray burst from SGR 1935+2154. Its observation complements the KW measurement.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Simultaneously, the hard X‑ray burst was observed with INTEGRAL…”
