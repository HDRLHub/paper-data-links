## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the analysis and modeling of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs) during the period between November 29 and December 7, 2020. The study aims to understand the heliospheric context and predict the arrival and impact of these solar events using the WSA–Enlil–SEPMOD modeling chain. The research leverages remote-sensing observations from Earth and STEREO-A, as well as in-situ measurements from six locations: Parker Solar Probe, STEREO-A, Mars, Earth, BepiColombo, and Solar Orbiter. The study validates the model predictions against these multi-point observations to assess the capabilities of real-time space weather forecasting tools.
