Sure, let's break down the task step by step to create a Python script using SunPy to query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for the specified data.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Context**:
   - We need to query data from the SDO/AIA instrument.
   - The data is required for two specific time ranges on June 7, 2011.
   - The wavelength of interest is 193 Å.

2. **Identify the Required Parameters**:
   - **Instrument**: AIA
   - **Wavelength**: 193 Å
   - **Time Ranges**:
     - Initial Eruption and Rising Phase: 05:40 UT – 06:22 UT
     - Falling Phase: 06:22 UT – 08:00 UT

3. **Construct the Query**:
   - Use SunPy's Fido module to construct the query.
   - Ensure the query is split into two parts to cover both time ranges.

4. **Print the Query Results**:
   - Print the results of the query to verify the data availability.

5. **Comment Out the Fetch Command**:
   - The script should not execute the data download but should have the fetch command commented out for future use.

### Python Script

```python
import sunpy.net.Fido as Fido
import sunpy.net.attrs as a
from sunpy.time import parse_time

# Define the time ranges for the two phases
time_range1 = a.Time(parse_time("2011-06-07 05:40"), parse_time("2011-06-07 06:22"))
time_range2 = a.Time(parse_time("2011-06-07 06:22"), parse_time("2011-06-07 08:00"))

# Define the instrument and wavelength
instrument = a.Instrument('AIA')
wavelength = a.Wavelength(193 * u.Angstrom)

# Construct the query for the initial eruption and rising phase
query1 = Fido.search(time_range1, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query Results for Initial Eruption and Rising Phase:")
print(query1)

# Construct the query for the falling phase
query2 = Fido.search(time_range2, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query Results for Falling Phase:")
print(query2)

# Uncomment the following lines to fetch the data
# files1 = Fido.fetch(query1)
# files2 = Fido.fetch(query2)
```

### Explanation

- **Imports**: Import necessary modules from SunPy.
- **Time Ranges**: Define the time ranges for the two phases using `parse_time` to ensure correct time format.
- **Instrument and Wavelength**: Define the instrument (AIA) and the wavelength (193 Å).
- **Queries**: Construct two separate queries for the two time ranges.
- **Print Results**: Print the results of each query to verify the data.
- **Fetch Command**: The fetch commands are commented out but provided for future use.

This script is explicit, well-commented, and directly reflects the data requirements specified in the context.
