## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates how solar faculae and network features relate to sunspots and explores the ensuing implications for solar and stellar brightness variations. By comparing chromospheric and magnetic indices (derived from measurements of the 10.7 cm radio flux, Ca II K 1 Å emission, Lyman α irradiance, Mg II emission, and magnetic flux in faculae and network) with various sunspot indices (total sunspot area, international sunspot number, and group sunspot number), the authors build and validate an empirical model (the YSK model). This model reconstructs facular indices from sunspot observations, accounting for the evolution of active regions and a possible nonlinear scaling. The data sets cover multiple solar cycles; some (e.g. the 10.7 cm radio flux and Lyman α irradiance composite) extend back to 1947, while others (such as the full-disc magnetograms for magnetic flux) are available from the 1970s onward.

- **Supporting Quote**: “...the Machol et al. (2019) Lyman α irradiance composite.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Recorded Irradiance Measurements
- **Time Range**: The composite nominally goes back to 1947; however, the segment from 1947 to 1977 is not based on direct measurements but on a model using 10.7 cm and 30 cm radio flux data. Direct measurement records are effectively used from 1977 onward.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...while the Machol et al. (2019) FLα composite goes back to 1947, the 1947 to 1977 segment … is not provided by FLα measurements…”

   - This instrument measures the Mg II h & k lines, serving as an indicator for chromospheric activity. The data are provided as a composite by the Institute for Umweltphysik at the Universität Bremen.
- **Supporting Quote**: “...the IUP Mg II index composite.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Index Records Over Solar Cycles
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided; the Mg II index is used alongside other chromospheric indices in multi-cycle comparisons.

- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments acquire daily full-disc solar magnetograms which are used to isolate and quantify the total magnetic flux enclosed in faculae and network regions (denoted as Fφ).

### 6. PMOD Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Composite Instrument
