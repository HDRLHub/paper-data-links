# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the magnetic field environment of NOAA Active Region (AR) 12673, which produced several significant solar energetic particle (SEP) events in September 2017. The study focuses on understanding the magnetic configuration of the AR, the surrounding field, and the decay index profile to determine the factors influencing SEP production and escape. The analysis includes data from various instruments observing EUV and white-light emissions, as well as potential field extrapolations. The paper aims to identify characteristics of the AR's magnetic field that are critical for SEP production and escape, which could improve forecasting of SEP events.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides photospheric magnetograms used to analyze the magnetic field configuration of AR 12673.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The radial magnetic field component is from the HMI SHARP data series (Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch; Bobra et al. 2014) where positive (negative) field is represented by white (black), respectively, saturated at ±500 G."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of AR 12673's magnetic field
- **Time Range**: 2017 September 4 – 2017 September 10
   - **Supporting Quote**: "NOAA active region (AR) 12673 appeared on the east solar limb on 28 August 2017... The AR first started flaring early on 2017 September 4 and produced its first CME later that day... AR 12673 was the source of 27 GOES M- and four X-class flares, eleven CMEs and three SEP events during the time period 2017 September 4–10."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The radial magnetic field component is from the HMI SHARP data series (Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch; Bobra et al. 2014)..."
- **Additional Comments**: The HMI data is used to create potential field models and analyze the decay index profile.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides EUV images used to observe flare ribbons, coronal loops, and CME propagation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The purple contours show the regions where the 1600 Å emission of the flare ribbons is above a threshold of 20 % of the maximum value."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of flare ribbons and CME propagation
- **Time Range**: 2017 September 4 – 2017 September 7
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Flare ribbons are initially observed along PIL 2, but an overlap with ribbons along this PIL from a flare just minutes before hinders the ability to discriminate which flare is responsible for these ribbons. As seen in AIA 1600 Å, flare ribbons are forming along PILs 3 and 4 by 18:16 UT on 2017 September 4..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "As seen in AIA 1600 Å, flare ribbons are forming along PILs 3 and 4 by 18:16 UT on 2017 September 4... The eruption begins at around ∼18:05 UT as observed by the expansion and propagation of coronal loops to the south-west, visible in the SDO/AIA 171 Å and running difference images."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission from flare ribbons and coronal loops
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The purple contours show the regions where the 1600 Å emission of the flare ribbons is above a threshold of 20 % of the maximum value."
- **Additional Comments**: AIA data is crucial for identifying the timing and location of flare ribbons and the dynamics of CME propagation.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO provides white-light coronagraph images used to observe CMEs.

- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME (Figure 2 d) is first seen in LASCO/C2 data at 19:00 UT on September 4 and has a radial speed of 973 km s−1."
- **Physical Observable**: CME propagation and speed
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME (Figure 2 d) is first seen in LASCO/C2 data at 19:00 UT on September 4 and has a radial speed of 973 km s−1."
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO data is used to determine the onset time, speed, and propagation direction of CMEs.

### GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite)
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES provides soft X-ray and proton flux data used to identify flare classes and SEP events.
