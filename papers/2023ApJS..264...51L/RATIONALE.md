produce the script. We need to construct a query that fetches data from the LASCO instrument on SOHO, specifically focusing on the C2 and C3 detectors which are commonly used for observing CMEs. The time range for the query will span from January 1, 1996, to August 31, 2021, as specified in the context. Since the context does not specify particular wavelengths or physical observables like intensity or velocity, we will focus on the general data available for these detectors. The script will be structured to query this data using SunPy's Fido interface, and it will display the results without downloading the files, adhering to the directive to comment out the Fido.fetch commands.
