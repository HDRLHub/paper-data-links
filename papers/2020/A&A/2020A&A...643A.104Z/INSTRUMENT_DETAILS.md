## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies the physical properties of solar polar plumes and their contribution to the fast solar wind. The authors apply the Doppler Dimming analysis to spectroscopic data obtained in the ultraviolet (UV) range to derive outflow speeds and electron densities in plumes and interplumes of the north polar coronal hole. The primary data are acquired by the SOHO/UVCS instrument during a campaign in April 1996, with context provided by co-temporal images from SOHO/LASCO-C2 and SOHO/EIT. The study discusses plume identification, the calibration and response corrections of the UVCS detectors, and compares its results with previous findings (including data from Hinode/EIS, SOHO/SUMER, STEREO/SECCHI, and UARS/SOLSTICE). The paper thus combines multi-instrument observations to investigate coronal dynamics and mass flux conservation in plumes.

- **General Comments**:
   - The UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) is the primary instrument used in this study.

UVCS observes specific ultraviolet lines including the O vi doublet at 1031.9 Å and 1037.6 Å, as well as the H i Lyα line at 1215.7 Å. The instrument’s data enabled the application of the Doppler Dimming technique to derive outflow speeds and electron densities.
