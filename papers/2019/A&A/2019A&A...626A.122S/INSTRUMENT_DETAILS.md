1. SOHO/LASCO (C2 and C3) on board SOHO  
   - General Comments:  
     • The LASCO coronagraphs are used to capture white‐light images of the solar corona and detect CMEs as they propagate outward from the Sun.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The associated CME was ﬁrst observed in the LASCO C2 coronagraph at 16:48 UT, appearing as a fast halo CME propagating towards the Earth… Due to a data gap, the CME was observed only very early on by LASCO C2 (between 16:48 UT and 17:24 UT), and it was not observed at all by the LASCO C3 instrument.”  
   - Data Collection Periods:  
     • For Event 1: LASCO C2 images are used from approximately 16:48 UT to 17:24 UT on 12 July 2012.  
     • For Event 2: LASCO C2 and LASCO C3 images are incorporated in the GCS fitting with the following time intervals:  
  – CME1: 15:45 UT – 17:54 UT on 13 June 2012  
  – CME2: 15:24 UT – 15:54 UT on 14 June 2012

2. STEREO/SECCHI Instruments (including COR2A, COR2B, and heliospheric imagers for J-maps)  
   - General Comments:  
     • The SECCHI suite on the STEREO spacecraft provides multi-viewpoint coronagraph and heliospheric imaging. These observations enable 3D reconstructions of CME geometry using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model and allow tracking of CME time–elongation profiles (J-maps).  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “We apply the GCS ﬁtting to contemporaneous images of the CMEs from SECCHI/COR2B and SECCHI/COR2A only, available in the time interval 16:54 UT - 18:24 UT.”  
     and later, regarding J-maps in Event 1:  
     “the CME leading edge in the STEREO-B J-map is clearly visible from 2◦ up to 56◦ in elongation.”  
   - Data Collection Periods:  
     • For Event 1:  
  – SECCHI/COR2A and COR2B images cover the time interval from 16:54 UT to 18:24 UT on 12 July 2012.  
  – STEREO-B heliospheric imagers are used to construct J-maps in which the CME leading edge is tracked from an elongation of about 2° up to 56°.  
     • For Event 2:  
  – STEREO-A J-maps are employed to track the CME leading edges, with CME1 observed between 2° and 14° in elongation and CME2 between 2° and 51° in elongation.

3. SDO Instruments – AIA and HMI  
   - General Comments:  
     • The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides high-cadence EUV images that capture dynamic coronal features (such as sigmoids and post-eruption arcades, “PEAs”), while the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) supplies photospheric magnetograms used for determining the filament’s polarity inversion line (PIL) and assessing the magnetic environment of the source regions.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     For Event 1, the paper states:  
     “Figure 2 shows AR 11520 on 12 July 2012 as observed by HMI, and by AIA in diﬀerent EUV channels. The source region in AIA 94 Å is characterised by the presence of a forward-S sigmoid… Over the 12 hours following the eruption, a long-lasting, stable PEA developed in the active region. Applying the method… to AIA 193 Å images of the PEA between 12 July at 18:00 UT and 13 July at 00:00 UT…”  
   - Data Collection Periods:  
     • For Event 1:  
  – AIA 94 Å images record the sigmoid starting around 15:00 UT on 12 July 2012.  
  – AIA 193 Å images are used to define the PEA during the period from 18:00 UT on 12 July 2012 until 00:00 UT on 13 July 2012.  
  – HMI magnetograms (e.g., one taken at 15:00 UT on 12 July 2012) are utilized to determine the magnetic structure/PIL of AR 11520.  
     • For Event 2:  
  – AIA and HMI observations are similarly employed; specifically, PEA1 is observed at 16:00 UT on 13 June 2012, and PEA2 is observed around 19:00 UT on 14 June 2012.

4. MESSENGER MAG on board the MESSENGER spacecraft  
   - General Comments:  
     • MESSENGER’s magnetometer (MAG) provided in-situ magnetic field measurements in the inner heliosphere near Mercury. These data are used to characterize the arrival and structure of the ICME.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The ICME Catalog at Mercury reports that the ICME-driven shock arrived at MESSENGER on 13 July 2012 at 10:53 UT. The ﬂux-rope signature started at 13:44 UT of the same day, and ended at 02:46 UT of the following day.”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • For Event 1: MESSENGER recorded the ICME-driven shock at 10:53 UT on 13 July 2012, followed by the flux-rope interval from 13:44 UT on 13 July 2012 until 02:46 UT on 14 July 2012.

5. Venus Express (VEX) MAG on board the Venus Express spacecraft  
   - General Comments:  
     • The magnetometer on Venus Express provides in-situ magnetic field data near Venus. These measurements help to track the propagation of CMEs in the inner heliosphere, particularly when a CME’s flank is encountered.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Good & Forsyth (2016) reported an ICME ﬂux-rope leading edge to arrive at VEX on 15 June 2012 at 19:26 UT, while the trailing edge was reported to pass at 08:28 UT on the following day.”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • For Event 2: Venus Express data indicate that the ICME encountered at Venus had its leading edge arriving at 19:26 UT on 15 June 2012 and its trailing edge passing at 08:28 UT on 16 June 2012.

6. Wind/OMNI In‐situ Measurements at Earth  
   - General Comments:  
     • The Wind spacecraft (and the associated OMNI data set) supplies continuous in-situ measurements of plasma and magnetic field parameters near Earth. These observations are critical for validating the arrival times and magnetic signatures of the modeled CMEs.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Figure 6 shows in-situ observations for the 12 July 2012 event from OMNI 1-min data… In addition, the Wind spacecraft (Ogilvie et al. 1995) detected the interplanetary shock on 14 July 2012 at 17:39 UT…”  
   - Data Collection Periods:  
     • For Event 1: OMNI 1-min data are used to capture the ICME signatures near Earth (covering the shock arrival and subsequent magnetic cloud passage, time range implicitly around the CME arrival on 14 July 2012).  
     • For Event 2: Wind observations report a shock at 17:39 UT on 14 July 2012 and a magnetic cloud interval from approximately 06:00 UT on 15 July 2012 up to 05:00 UT on 17 July 2012.
