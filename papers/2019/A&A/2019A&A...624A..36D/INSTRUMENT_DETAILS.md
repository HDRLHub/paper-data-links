## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper benchmarks new atomic data by comparing predicted versus observed solar EUV irradiances. The study focuses on observations of the quiet Sun during solar minimum and compares them with measurements taken during periods of increased solar activity. Data from a variety of instruments—ranging from sounding rocket experiments to space‐borne spectrometers—cover a broad wavelength range (approximately 60–1040 Å) and include physical observables such as spectral radiances/irradiances. The instruments serve not only to test the completeness of atomic data and ion charge state distributions but also to help establish solar chemical abundances. Key instruments include the prototype PEVE (a precursor to SDO/EVE), the operational (in‐flight) SDO/EVE, and several instruments aboard SoHO (including CDS with its NIS and GIS detectors, and SUMER), as well as TIMED SEE, Hinode EIS, and earlier sounding rocket experiments (EUNIS and SERTS).
