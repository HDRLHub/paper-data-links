1. Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
   - **General Comments**: This instrument (or more precisely, the PSP mission) is referenced in the paper as having provided in‑situ measurements of whistler waves in the solar wind. The observations from PSP are used as supporting evidence for the role of whistler‐limited transport in high‑β plasmas.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Moreover, recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe, revealed large amplitude, oblique whistler waves embedded in regions of depressed magnetic field intensity where the local βₑ was high (Agapitov et al. 2020; Cattell et al. 2021a).”
   - **Data Collection Periods**: The paper does not specify explicit dates or time ranges associated with the PSP observations.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observable**:
     - **Wavelength(s)/Detectors**: No specific wavelengths or detector details are provided.
     - **Physical Observable**: The PSP data are related to measurements of magnetic field fluctuations (whistler wave amplitudes) and electron heat flux behavior in the solar wind.

2. Wind Spacecraft
   - **General Comments**: The Wind spacecraft dataset is cited in the paper to illustrate the rollover of the electron heat flux in the solar wind as collisionality decreases. The data from Wind support the scaling of heat flux with local plasma βₑ.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Measurements from the large Wind spacecraft dataset revealed that the electron heat flux rolled over to a value below the collisionless heat flux Q₀ as Lₙ/L increases...” (Bale et al. 2013; Tong et al. 2018, 2019).
   - **Data Collection Periods**: The paper does not provide any specific dates or observational time ranges for the Wind measurements.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observable**:
     - **Wavelength(s)/Detectors**: No details on wavelengths or detector configurations are provided.
     - **Physical Observable**: Observables include the scaling behavior of the electron heat flux, highlighting its sensitivity to the ratio Lₙ/L (mean-free-path to temperature scale length) and plasma βₑ.

3. ARTEMIS Mission
   - **General Comments**: The ARTEMIS dataset is referenced alongside the Wind dataset to further support the scaling of electron heat flux with βₑ and to correlate the measured whistler wave amplitudes with variations in the heat flux.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Further, the measured amplitude of whistler waves increased both with heat flux and with βₑ (Tong et al. 2019)...”
   - **Data Collection Periods**: No specific time ranges or observation dates are mentioned in the paper for the ARTEMIS observations.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observable**:
     - **Wavelength(s)/Detectors**: The paper does not offer details on particular detector wavelengths or instrument configurations for ARTEMIS.
     - **Physical Observable**: The ARTEMIS observations provide measurements of magnetic field fluctuations associated with whistler waves and how these correlate with the electron heat flux behavior.
