## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports the detection of quasi‑periodic pulsations (QPPs) with multiple periods in a powerful X9.3 solar flare observed on 6 September 2017. The authors analyze non‑stationary pulsations in several wavelength channels – including the mid‑ultraviolet (MUV) Balmer continuum, Lyα, hard X‑ray (HXR), and low‑frequency radio emissions – using wavelet and Fourier analyses. The study draws upon observations from multiple instruments with different time cadences and energy/wavelength responses, thereby providing insights into the physical processes (such as nonthermal electron acceleration and magnetic reconnection) that modulate the flare emissions. Specific time segments of the flare impulsive phase, generally spanning from about 11:55 UT to 12:03 UT (with further subdivision into e.g., 11:56–11:57 UT, 11:56–11:59 UT, and 11:57–12:02 UT for different QPP period ranges), are critical to the findings.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. PROBA2/LYRA on board PROBA2
- **General Comments**:
   - LYRA is a solar irradiance instrument providing high time resolution (0.05 s) measurements in several broad spectral channels. In this study, key channels include the Lyα channel (Channel 1) centered at 1216 Å and the MUV channel (Channel 2) covering 1900–2220 Å, which captures the hydrogen Balmer continuum. A fourth channel (Channel 4, 1–200 Å) measures SXR/EUV emissions with a similar time evolution to the GOES SXR flux.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LYRA provides the solar irradiance measurement in four wide spectral channels with a high time resolution of 0.05 s (Dominique et al. 2013, 2018)." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: QPP Signatures in Lyα and MUV Balmer Continuum
- **Time Range**: Approximately 11:55:07 UT to 12:03:27 UT (with particular focus on the impulsive phase between ~11:56 UT and ~12:02 UT)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (b) draws the normalized light curves between 11:55:07 UT and 12:03:27 UT from LYRA channels in the Lyα (black) and MUV Balmer continuum (cyan) ranges..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Channel 1 (Lyα): 1200–1230 Å
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Channel 1 ... observes the solar irradiance in the FUV channel centered at the Lyα 1216 ˚A line."
   - Channel 2 (MUV): 1900–2220 Å
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Channel 2 takes the solar observation in the MUV channel between 1900 ˚A and 2220 ˚A... which is demonstrated to be consistent with the hydrogen Balmer continuum emission around 2000 ˚A."

      - ~20–30 s QPPs occurring from about 11:56 UT to 11:57 UT.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "the quasi‑periods of ∼20−30 s are seen to happen from about 11:56 UT to 11:57 UT only."
      - ~30–50 s QPPs observed between about 11:56 UT and 11:59 UT.

### 2. Insight-HXMT on board the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - Insight-HXMT is primarily designed for high‑energy astrophysics but is shown here to capture solar flare HXR emissions. It provides two key data products: the Medium Energy X‑ray telescope (ME) detecting in the 5–30 keV band and the Anti‑Coincidence Detector (ACD) sensitive to HXR emissions >100 keV. Both channels have a time cadence of 1 s.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In this study, two X‑ray light curves measured by the Insight‑HXMT, which has a time cadence of 1 s, were also used... The Medium Energy X‑ray telescope (ME) observes the X‑ray emission normally at 5−30 keV... The Anti‑Coincidence Detectors (ACD) provides the HXR ﬂux at higher energy, i.e., >100 keV..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: QPP Analysis in HXR Emissions
- **Time Range**: Approximately 11:55:07 UT to 12:03:27 UT (with specific QPP intervals identified within this span)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (b) presents the X‑ray light curves as normalization during 11:55:07−12:03:27 UT derived from the ME (magenta) and ACD (red)."
- **Wavelength(s)/Energy Bands**:
   - ME: 5–30 keV (soft X‑ray to lower hard X‑ray energies)
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The Medium Energy X‑ray telescope (ME) observes the X‑ray emission normally at 5−30 keV..."
   - ACD: >100 keV (hard X‑rays)
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The Anti‑Coincidence Detectors (ACD) provides the HXR ﬂux at higher energy, i.e., >100 keV..."

      - QPPs with periods of approximately 20–40 s between ~11:56 UT and ~11:58 UT.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "the quasi‑periods of roughly 20−40 s are found to appear between ∼11:56 UT and ∼11:58 UT..."
      - QPPs with periods around 50–55 s from roughly 11:57 UT to 12:01 UT.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "the periods of about 50−55 s are seen to occur from about 11:57 UT to 12:01 UT."

### 3. BLENSW CALLISTO Radio Spectrograph (Ground-based)
- **General Comments**:
   - The BLENSW instrument is a ground‑based radio spectrograph, operating as part of the CALLISTO network, with a time cadence of 0.25 s. It measures low‑frequency radio emissions over a range of approximately 20–76 MHz and detects transient type III bursts associated with solar flare electron beams.

- **Time Range**: Approximately 11:57 UT to 12:02 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A sequence of transient bursts can be found in the radio dynamic spectrum during the ﬂare impulsive phase, i.e., during ∼11:57−12:02 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)/Frequency Range**:
   - ~20–76 MHz, with specific analysis conducted at 34.75 MHz.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (b) also draws the normalized radio ﬂux (green) at a low frequency of 34.75 MHz..."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Low‑frequency radio bursts (type III bursts) that trace the propagation of upward traveling electron beams.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "they can be regarded as the type III radio bursts and could be helpful to trace the propagating electron beams..."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - A time delay of about 60 s relative to HXR signals is noted, which is interpreted as the propagation time for the electron beams.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "A maximum correlation coeﬃcient of ∼0.57 between the HXR and low‑frequency radio data is seen at the time lag of around 60 s..."

### 4. GOES-16 XRS on board GOES-16
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES-16’s X‑ray Sensor (XRS) measures full-disk solar soft X‑ray (SXR) flux in the 1–8 Å band with a time cadence of 1 s. Although its primary role here is to indicate the overall timing and evolution of the flare, it provides a benchmark for correlating other nonthermal waveband observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the GOES SXR ﬂux at 1−8 ˚ A (black curve) suggests that the powerful ﬂare begins at about 11:53 UT and reaches its maximum at around 12:02 UT..."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Flare Onset and Peak Observation**
- **Time Range**: From about 11:53 UT (flare onset) to approximately 12:02 UT (flare maximum)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the powerful ﬂare begins at about 11:53 UT and reaches its maximum at around 12:02 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 1–8 Å (soft X‑ray range)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Soft X‑ray flux that outlines the thermal evolution of the solar flare.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The GOES data serve as context for comparing the nonthermal signatures observed by LYRA, Insight‑HXMT, and BLENSW.
