produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) based on the specific requirements and details provided in the context.

1. **Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP)**:
   - We need to query for microwave fluxes and their circular polarizations at specific frequencies.
   - The time range is from June 1, 1994, to the present.
   - Frequencies of interest are 1, 2, 3.75, and 9.4 GHz.

2. **Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)**:
   - Query for EUV fluxes and magnetic field strengths.
   - Continuous data collection, with specific periods noted for calibration and comparison with microwave data.

3. **Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)**:
   - Query for X-ray flux monitoring.
   - Data used from the same periods as microwave observations for direct comparison.

Given the VSO interface details, we will focus on the instruments and data types available. Note that specific instruments like NoRP might not be directly accessible via SunPy's Fido, and alternative data access methods may be required.
