# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper discusses the progenitors of gamma‐ray bursts (GRBs) by comparing short and long events and their observational characteristics. It reviews how properties such as duration, spectral hardness, afterglow localization, and host galaxy features contribute to discriminating between GRBs originating from compact binary mergers (“type I”) and those from the core collapse of massive stars (“type II”). A number of space‐ and ground‐based instruments and catalogues are referenced as sources of the observational data—each contributing to the analysis of GRB durations, energy spectra, and afterglow properties—to build a comprehensive picture of these extreme cosmic events.
