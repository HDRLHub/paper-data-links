## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the imaging spectroscopy of a solar radio event that accompanied a coronal mass ejection (CME) and an M2.1 GOES soft X-ray flare on 2015 September 20. The study focuses on the detailed analysis of multiple burst sources, particularly a moving type IV burst observed as outward motion that is compared with simultaneous white‐light CME observations. Multiple instruments spanning metric radio frequencies to white-light and microwaves were used to obtain spatial, spectral, and temporal information that constrained the burst emission mechanism (favoring gyrosynchrotron radiation) and provided diagnostics on the physical conditions in the CME core. Key observational intervals include radio data acquired over a 120‐minute period (from roughly 17:36 UT to 19:36 UT) and white-light observations from LASCO‐C2 between 18:12 UT and 19:12 UT.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA)
- **General Comments**:
  - OVRO-LWA is a ground-based radio interferometer consisting of 288 dual-polarization dipole antennas (256 in a 200 m core and 32 on baselines up to ≈1.6 km). It is optimized for solar imaging spectroscopy in the frequency range 27–85 MHz, achieving spatial resolution of about 8.5′ at 80 MHz. During commissioning, it operated in a mode that produced images at a 9-s cadence, and its data allowed high spectral resolution imaging over a 22 MHz instantaneous bandwidth.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “We present ﬁrst results of a solar radio event observed with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) at metric wavelengths… The array [...] spatially resolve the Sun in the frequency range 27–85 MHz with high spectral resolution.”

- **Data Collection Period 1: Commissioning Solar Observations**
  - **Time Range**: 2015 September 20, approximately 17:36 UT to 19:36 UT  
    - **Supporting Quote**: “The ﬂare-CME event was analyzed over a period of 120 min with images of 9-s cadence.”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Operates over 27–85 MHz; during this event, available observing windows were 41–55 MHz and 61–69 MHz.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “The ﬁrst effect reduced the bandwidth to two available windows between 41–55 MHz and 61–69 MHz as opposed to the full bandwidth capability of 27–85 MHz.”
  - **Physical Observable**: Total intensity (brightness temperature of the Sun, burst source positions and motions), spectral flux density.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “OVRO-LWA images of the Sun are created at each time in the 9 available frequency‐subbands to create a movie…”  
  - **Additional Comments**: The instrument’s configuration during commissioning included issues such as frequency offset (150 kHz) and a limited understanding of circular polarization calibration, which led to a focus on total intensity imaging.

### 2. LASCO-C2 Coronagraph on SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO-C2 is a white-light coronagraph aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) that images the solar corona. It was used to track the white-light CME and to provide context for the radio source positions by measuring the CME’s leading edge and core.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The ﬁrst signature of the white light CME (WL-CME) was detected at 18:12 UT in the ﬁeld of view of the C2 coronagraph of ... LASCO.”

- **Data Collection Period 1: CME White-Light Imaging**
  - **Time Range**: 2015 September 20, from 18:12 UT to 19:12 UT  
    - **Supporting Quote**: “LASCO-C2 images with a 12-min cadence were obtained between 18:12–19:12 UT…”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: White light (visible continuum).
    - **Supporting Quote**: “...WL-CME contours from C2…”
  - **Physical Observable**: CME brightness, leading edge and core positions, allowing for height-time measurements.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “A height-time plot of the CME leading edge and core is shown…”
  - **Additional Comments**: The LASCO-C2 data were further processed (e.g., background subtraction, median filtering) to enhance the CME features used for density estimates via graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) reconstruction.

### 3. WIND/WAVES Radio Spectrograph (RAD1 and RAD2 Receivers)
- **General Comments**:
  - The WIND/WAVES instrument is a radio spectrograph onboard the WIND spacecraft. It provides complementary dynamic spectral data by covering lower frequency bands than OVRO-LWA.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “We also use data from the WAVES (Bougeret et al. 1995) radio spectrograph onboard the WIND spacecraft, where spectra from both RAD1 and RAD2 receivers was obtained.”

- **Data Collection Period 1: Contextual Dynamic Spectrum**
  - **Time Range**: Observations cover the event on 2015 September 20, concurrent with the radio burst event (exact start and end times are not explicitly stated but are used in composite spectra with other instruments).
    - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 5 shows a composite dynamic spectrum with the lower frequencies from WIND/WAVES RAD1 and RAD2…”
  - **Wavelength(s)**:
    - RAD1: 20–1040 kHz (bandwidth of 3 kHz per channel)
    - RAD2: 1.075–13.825 MHz (bandwidth of 20 kHz per channel)
    - **Supporting Quote**: “The frequency ranges between 20–1040 kHz and 1.075–13.825 MHz are covered by RAD1 and RAD2 respectively…”
  - **Physical Observable**: Radio dynamic spectrum showing intensity variations across frequency and time.
  - **Additional Comments**: The WAVES data provide the lower frequency context and help identify type II burst signatures outside the OVRO-LWA frequency range.

### 4. Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA)
- **General Comments**:
  - EOVSA observes microwave emission from the Sun and provided complementary flux density measurements that are compared with OVRO-LWA data. It helps constrain the energetic electron populations through its gyrosynchrotron spectra.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The dynamic spectrum from EOVSA is shown in Figure 4 up to 18:05 UT...”

- **Data Collection Period 1: Microwave Observations**
  - **Time Range**: Observations referenced up to 18:05 UT on 2015 September 20  
    - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 4 shows the LWA dynamic spectrum in context with the corresponding dynamic spectrum from EOVSA (top) obtained at some 2-orders-of-magnitude higher frequency… Observations ended at 18:05 UT.”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Microwave frequencies covering 1–18 GHz.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “...EOVSA which covers 1–18 GHz…”
  - **Physical Observable**: Microwave flux density, used to diagnose gyrosynchrotron emission characteristics.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “The microwave ﬂux density from EOVSA, which is due to gyrosynchrotron emission…”
  - **Additional Comments**: Dual episodes of enhanced activity in the microwave were observed, peaking at approximately 17:55 UT and again at 18:03 UT.

- **Data Collection Period 1: Meter-wave Spectral Observations**
  - **Time Range**: The RSTN data were used contemporaneously with the 2015 September 20 event (exact observing period is not specified, but it covers the active event phase).
    - **Supporting Quote**: “We extract dynamic spectra from the WIND/WAVES and RSTN radio instruments…”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: 25–180 MHz.
  - **Physical Observable**: Radio spectral flux density, used to identify features such as type II and type III bursts.
  - **Additional Comments**: RSTN data complemented the OVRO-LWA high signal-to-noise spectra by providing coverage for the broader meter-wave band.

### 6. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/AIA provides high-resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun, which are used to contextualize the radio observations by comparing the solar disk and coronal structures.
