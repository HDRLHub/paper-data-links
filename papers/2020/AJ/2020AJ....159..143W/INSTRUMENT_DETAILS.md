## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the phenomenon of supercatastrophic disruption (SCD) of near‐Sun asteroids by comparing the dynamical histories and observational properties of various near‐Sun populations – including near-Earth asteroids, SOHO comets, meter-class fireballs, and millimeter-sized meteoroids. The authors use numerical integrations of asteroid orbits, archival imaging, and radar meteor observations to assess whether small asteroids undergo rapid break-up into fine debris (possibly via meteoroid erosion) when their perihelion distances become very small. Observational data are drawn from spaceborne coronagraph imagery (from SOHO’s LASCO), targeted ground-based telescope campaigns, archival images from Pan-STARRS, and a long-term dataset of meteor detections from the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). These diverse datasets cover different time ranges (from historic observations since 1996 up to recent observations in 2019) and measure various physical observables such as brightness, orbital elements, and meteor echo velocities in order to probe the possible disruption mechanisms acting on near-Sun bodies.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO is a coronagraph instrument flown on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). It has been used to routinely image the near-Sun region and detect comets that pass close to the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)’s Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) has been observing comets in the near-Sun region since 1996.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: SOHO Comet Observations (Sungrazers, Sunskirters, and Ungrouped Comets)
- **Time Range**: 1996–2008
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “Lamy et al. (2013) list 75 ungrouped SOHO comets recorded between 1996-2008.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the text.
  - **Supporting Quote**: (No explicit wavelength quote provided.)
- **Physical Observable**: Near-Sun cometary brightness and orbital parameters.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “...the vast majority of these comets are only seen at a single perihelion passage, their semimajor axis and eccentricity are unknown in almost all cases, though their perihelion distance and inclination can be measured.”
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO imagery has been central to characterizing the various families (Kreutz, Meyer, Marsden/Kracht groups, and ungrouped comets) and assessing whether some SOHO comets might be linked to asteroidal (SCD) origins.

### 2. 0.61 m T24 Telescope on the itelescope.net Network
- **General Comments**:
  - This ground-based telescope was used to obtain follow-up imaging of asteroid (467372) 2004 LG. The observations were aimed at detecting any cometary activity and better constraining the object’s appearance.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “We also obtained ﬁve unﬁltered 300 second exposures tracked at the expected sky motion of (467372) 2004 LG on 11 May 2019 with the 0.61 m T24 telescope on the itelescope.net network.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Targeted Observation of (467372) 2004 LG
- **Time Range**: 11 May 2019 (exact UT start and end times not provided; observations consisted of five 300-second exposures on that date)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “...on 11 May 2019 with the 0.61 m T24 telescope...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Unfiltered optical imaging is mentioned; no specific passband is detailed.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “ﬁve unﬁltered 300 second exposures…” 
- **Physical Observable**: Apparent magnitude and trail width; used to assess cometary activity.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “The asteroid was visible in the stacked image at 1-sigma at an apparent magnitude of 20.4 but no cometary activity was detectable.”
- **Additional Comments**: These observations help in determining whether the object shows signs of disruption or cometary behavior, as part of the study examining SCD candidates.

### 3. Pan-STARRS Imaging System
- **General Comments**:
  - Pan-STARRS is a wide-field imaging survey telescope noted for its high-quality optical images. In the context of this paper, Pan-STARRS images were used to further inspect asteroid (467372) 2004 LG.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Pan-STARRS images of this asteroid taken in June 2010 (Weryk, 2019, private communication) show a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) perpendicular to the trail of 1.7”, nominally larger than that of the stars (1.46±0.05”)...”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Archival Imaging of (467372) 2004 LG
- **Time Range**: June 2010 (exact dates not provided; month and year are given)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “Pan-STARRS images of this asteroid taken in June 2010…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Standard broadband optical imaging; no specific filter information is provided.
  - **Supporting Quote**: (Not explicitly mentioned.)
- **Physical Observable**: Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the object's trail relative to stellar point spread function.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “...show a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) perpendicular to the trail of 1.7”, nominally larger than that of the stars (1.46±0.05”).”
- **Additional Comments**: Although the Pan-STARRS images did not trigger a report of cometary activity, they provided valuable morphological details that contribute to the argument regarding the physical state and evolution of (467372) 2004 LG.

### 4. Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR)
- **General Comments**:
  - CMOR is a backscatter radar system designed to detect meteors. It is employed in this study to measure the orbits of millimeter-sized meteoroids in the near-Sun region.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Our sample of millimeter-sized near-Sun meteors is collected with the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) (Webster et al. 2004; Jones et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2008). Located near London, Canada, CMOR is a backscatter radar comprising a 15 kW transmitter operating at 29.85 MHz and ﬁve separate receiver stations.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Meteor Detection for Near-Sun Meteoroids
- **Time Range**: 2011–2019
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “Figure 4 shows a density plot of the meteors collected during 2011-2019.”
- **Wavelength(s)/Frequency**: Radar operating at 29.85 MHz (radio wavelength determined by the transmitter frequency, though the precise optical wavelength is not applicable)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “...transmitter operating at 29.85 MHz…”
- **Physical Observable**: Velocity vectors, echo amplitudes, and derived orbital parameters of meteor echoes; used to assess the distribution of millimeter-sized meteoroids in near-Sun space.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - “Meteor echoes detected at the main site plus two or more stations produce velocity measurements of approximately 5000 meteor echoes daily.”
- **Additional Comments**: The radar data are debiased to account for observational geometry and collision probabilities. The resulting dataset is critical in comparing the population of meteoroids to that of near-Earth asteroids, particularly for assessing the presence of small fragments that may result from SCD.
