## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the analysis of magnetic flux emergence in solar active regions (ARs) that produced M5.0 or stronger flares during Solar Cycles 23 and 24. The study examines 100 ARs to determine the presence or absence of magnetic flux emergence 2-3 days before the onset of strong flares. The findings categorize the ARs into four types based on their magnetic flux emergence patterns: Type I (emergence from a quiet-Sun area), Type II (significant new flux emergence within a pre-existing AR), Type III (minor flux emergence within a pre-existing AR), and Type IV (no emergence observed). The study utilizes data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to analyze the magnetic fields.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI was used to observe the photospheric magnetic fields of solar active regions from 1996 to 2010. It provided essential data for analyzing the magnetic flux variations associated with solar flares.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from 1996 to 2010
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2010
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observes the photospheric Ni I 6768 Å spectral line
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight magnetograms of solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: The data were crucial for the early part of the study covering Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Solar Cycle 24.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI provided high-resolution data on the solar magnetic fields from 2010 onwards, complementing and continuing the observations started by SOHO/MDI.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations from 2010 to 2017
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observes the Fe I 6173 Å photospheric spectral line
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight magnetograms of solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: HMI's data were used for the latter part of the study, covering the continuation of Solar Cycle 24, providing higher resolution images which were crucial for detailed analysis of magnetic flux emergence in active regions.
