This script queries the VSO data archive for SDO/AIA observations during the primary EUV wave event
as described in the paper. We target the data recorded between 15:50 UT and 16:30 UT on 2017-09-10.

Instrument: SDO AIA
Time Range: 2017-09-10T15:50:00 to 2017-09-10T16:30:00

Note:
 - The query is constructed using sunpy.net.Fido with descriptive attributes.
 - The corresponding fetch command is included as a commented-out line.
 - The VSO interface confirms that SDO AIA observations (with appropriate EUV channels) are available.
