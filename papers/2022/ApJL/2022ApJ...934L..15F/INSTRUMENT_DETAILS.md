# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper reports on the first observation of a solar energetic particle (SEP) event by China's Tianwen-1 (TW-1) mission while en route to Mars. The event, occurring on November 29, 2020, was associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME) and was observed by multiple spacecraft within 1 AU, including TW-1, ACE, SOHO, and Wind. The study focuses on understanding the particle acceleration and transport processes by comparing observations from TW-1 and near-Earth spacecraft. The paper highlights the role of cross-field diffusion in SEP propagation and the reservoir phenomenon, where particle intensities become uniform across large heliospheric distances. The findings contribute to improving models of space radiation environments, which is crucial for future Mars missions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer (MEPA) on board Tianwen-1
- **General Comments**:
   - MEPA was designed to measure energetic particles in near-Mars space, capturing energy spectra, fluxes, and elemental compositions of charged particles.
- **Supporting Quote**: "To measure energetic particles in near-Mars space, the Mars Energetic Particle Analyzer (MEPA) instrument onboard China′s Tianwen-1 (TW-1) mission was designed."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of SEP event
- **Time Range**: November 29, 2020 – December 5, 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "During the event, TW-1 was at about 1.39 AU, and the onboard TW-1/MEPA was fortuitous and happened to be switched on to fully capture the particle intensity variations of this event."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Energetic charged particles (protons, electrons, alpha particles, and heavy ions)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The highly capable and configurable TW-1/MEPA instrument is able to detect multiple species of energetic charged particles over a relatively wide energy range, specifically, 0.1–12 MeV electrons, 2–100 MeV protons, 25–300 MeV alpha particles, and heavy ions up to iron."
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument provided crucial data for understanding the SEP event's temporal and spatial evolution.

### Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - ACE provided near-Earth measurements of proton fluxes, contributing to the comparative analysis with TW-1 data.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We collected proton flux measurements from two sources: one from the TW-1/MEPA instrument, and the other one from three near-Earth spacecraft, including ACE, SOHO, and Wind."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of SEP event
- **Time Range**: November 28, 2020 – December 5, 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "All data were acquired from 28 November to 5 December 2020, and were collated to a 1-hour resolution."

- **Physical Observable**: Proton fluxes
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The level-2 ACE/EPAM/LEMS120 data were available from the ACE Science Center."
- **Additional Comments**: ACE data were used to analyze the SEP event's characteristics near Earth.

### Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO provided additional near-Earth measurements, aiding in the study of SEP event characteristics.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We collected proton flux measurements from two sources: one from the TW-1/MEPA instrument, and the other one from three near-Earth spacecraft, including ACE, SOHO, and Wind."
