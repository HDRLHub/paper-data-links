# This script, including code comments, was initially drafted by an AI model. Please use with caution.

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for the query
time_range = a.Time('1997-01-01', '1997-12-31')

# Define the instrument and source
instrument = a.Instrument('SUMER')
source = a.Source('SOHO')

# Define the wavelength range in Angstroms
wavelength = a.Wavelength(670 * u.Angstrom, 1520 * u.Angstrom)

# Construct the query
query = Fido.search(time_range, instrument, source, wavelength)

# Print the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script sets up a query for the SOHO/SUMER instrument, specifying the time range for the year 1997 and the appropriate wavelength range. The query results are printed, and the data fetching command is commented out as per the instructions.
