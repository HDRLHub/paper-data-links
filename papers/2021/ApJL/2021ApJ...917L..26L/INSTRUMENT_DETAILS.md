## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates whether the recent solar minimum 24/25 exhibits unusual characteristics compared to previous minima (22/23 and 23/24). The study analyzes the solar polar magnetic field, coronal magnetic field structure using the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, and in situ solar wind measurements. The primary data sources include synoptic maps and polar field measurements from ground‐based observatories (WSO and GONG), in situ solar wind observations from the OMNI database, and sunspot number records from SILSO. Specific time periods used are: minimum 22/23 (March 1996 – February 1997), minimum 23/24 (the two‐year period covering 2008–2009), and minimum 24/25 (the two‐year period spanning 2019–2020). These observational intervals play an integral role in comparing the solar wind parameters, the morphology of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and the evolution of the solar polar fields among the different solar minima.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - WSO is used to provide synoptic maps of the solar photospheric magnetic field for PFSS modeling as well as direct polar field measurements. These observations serve as the basis for understanding the magnetic configuration during the solar minimum 22/23.

   - GONG provides high-resolution synoptic maps with less data gaps. In this study, GONG maps are utilized to derive the PFSS-based coronal field configuration for solar minima 23/24 and 24/25.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "...and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) synoptic maps for minima 23/24 and 24/25. The GONG maps available since 2006 have higher spatial resolution and less data gaps."
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: Minimum 23/24 Observations
- **Time Range**: The two-year period covering 2008 and 2009  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we choose a two-year period, 2008 and 2009, for minimum 23/24 in this study."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided text.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No explicit wavelength information is provided for GONG observations in the paper.]
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic field distributions used to identify coronal holes and to map the coronal magnetic field.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The positions of the coronal holes are found by tracing the magnetic ﬁeld lines from solar surface to the source surface."
- **Additional Comments**: The maps are crucial for tracking the evolution of coronal hole distributions during this unusually structured solar minimum.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Minimum 24/25 Observations
- **Time Range**: The two-year period spanning 2019 to 2020  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we therefore also choose a two-year period from 2019 to 2020 for minimum 24/25."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided text.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No explicit wavelength information is mentioned for these observations.]
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic field and coronal hole mapping that reveal changes in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) morphology.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "an isolated band of low-latitude coronal hole is found in the second half of 2019 ... resulting in about half of the near-ecliptic ﬁeld lines originating from low-latitude."
- **Additional Comments**: The GONG data for this period help illustrate the transition of the corona into a classic dipolar configuration later in the minimum.

### 3. OMNI In-Situ Measurements (OMNI Data Base)
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI database is the source for near-Earth in situ solar wind measurements. These measurements provide key physical observables such as solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, mass flux density, and number density.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "The near-Earth insitu data is obtained from the OMNI data base."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Minimum 23/24 Observations
- **Time Range**: The observational period during 2008–2009

- **Time Range**: The interval between 2019 and 2020  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For the recent solar minimum 24/25, strong fast solar wind streams with maximum speed higher than 600 km/s are observed between yr 2019.5 and 2019.9," and later "Between 2020.0 and 2020.5, as the solar corona evolves into the dipolar state, the slow solar wind becomes dominant..."
