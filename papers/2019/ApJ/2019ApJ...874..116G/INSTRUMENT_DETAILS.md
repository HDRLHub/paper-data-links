## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the distribution of weak photospheric magnetic field values using synoptic maps from six different data-sets. The authors analyze the weak‐field asymmetry—the shift of the peak of a Gaussian fitted to the histogram of weak magnetic field values—from zero. The study compares data obtained with several ground‐based and space‐based instruments over multiple solar cycles. The observations span several decades, with specific time intervals quoted for each instrument. The study further examines how the apparent asymmetry varies with the resolution of synoptic maps, indicating that lower-resolution maps tend to yield larger asymmetry values. Key physical observables include the line-of-sight or pseudo-radial magnetic field values, obtained using different magnetograph techniques and detectors.

## Instrumentation Details

- **General Comments**:
   - WSO provides synoptic maps of the line-of-sight magnetic field with a resolution of 72×30. The measurements are converted to pseudo-radial fields. This instrument has the unique advantage of offering a long, continuous data series with no major instrument changes over four solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**: “The WSO synoptic map gives the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld with a resolution of 72 ∗30 (evenly spaced in longitude and sine latitude, highest latitude bin centered at ±75.2°)... In this paper we used all the available WSO data from CR 1642 – 2180, i.e., between 1976.3 – 2018.”

### 3. NSO Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope (KPVT)
- **General Comments**:
   - The KPVT synoptic maps were produced using two different magnetographs during different periods. The first instrument was a 512-channel magnetograph, and it was later succeeded by a spectromagnetograph. Both provided observations of the photospheric magnetic field, which were used to generate pseudo-radial maps.
- **Supporting Quote**: “At NSO Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope (KPVT) two instruments were used: the 512-channel magnetograph in 1975 – 1993 and spectromagnetograph in 1992 – 2003.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: 512-channel Magnetograph
- **Time Range**: 1975 – 1993
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the 512-channel magnetograph in 1975 – 1993…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Context does not detail the wavelengths for KPVT observations.)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (pseudo-radial after correction for zero-level offsets)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld… have been produced at the NSO Kitt Peak…”
- **Additional Comments**: The high-resolution synoptic maps from KPVT have a resolution of 360×180 pixels and were later re-sampled to lower resolutions.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Spectromagnetograph
- **Time Range**: 1992 – 2003.7
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...spectromagnetograph in 1992 – 2003.7.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No wavelength information is provided in the text for KPVT’s spectromagnetograph.)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (as with the earlier instrument, measured and converted to pseudo-radial fields)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld…”
- **Additional Comments**: A marked change in instrument performance is noted, with larger asymmetry values during the 512-channel magnetograph period compared to the spectromagnetograph period.

### 4. SOHO/MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager on-board SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI is a space-based instrument that provided high-resolution magnetograms, which were later re-mapped to produce pseudo-radial synoptic maps. Its data were a critical component in studying the evolution of weak-field asymmetries during solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**: “Space-based high resolution magnetic ﬁeld observations were obtained from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft from 1996 – 2011.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Synoptic Observations from MDI
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2011 (derived from 3600×1080 resolution synoptic maps)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the MDI synoptic maps included in this paper cover CR 1909 – 2100, i.e., between 1996.3 – 2010.6.” (Note: Although the text mentions studies extending to 2010.6 for certain maps, the original instrument operation is stated as 1996 – 2011.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly detailed; the instrument observes in the spectral domain pertinent to solar magnetograms (commonly Ni I 6768 Å for MDI though not directly mentioned here).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The paper does not specify the wavelength, only that the instrument produces one-minute magnetograms from four filtergrams.)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (pseudo-radial field derived from line-of-sight measurements)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...converted to pseudo-radial ﬁeld magnetograms.”
- **Additional Comments**: Each pixel in the MDI synoptic map is generated as an average from nearly 20 one-minute magnetograms taken within ±7° of the central meridian.

### 5. SOLIS/VSM (Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun / Vector Spectromagnetograph)
- **General Comments**:
   - VSM is the successor instrument to KPVT at NSO and provides high-resolution vector magnetic field measurements. Its data are used to create synoptic maps with various resolutions to study weak-field asymmetries.
- **Supporting Quote**: “KPVT was succeeded by Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SO‐LIS) telescope and the Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) in 2003. … SOLIS/VSM synoptic maps are constructed from magnetograms measured under good weather conditions during a temporal window of 40 days…”

   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the VSM synoptic maps give the pseudo-radial ﬁelds…”
- **Additional Comments**: High-resolution VSM synoptic maps (1800×900 pixels) are used to generate lower resolution maps (360×180 and 72×30) via block averaging to assess resolution effects on weak-field asymmetries.

### 6. SDO/HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on-board SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI on SDO produces high-resolution synoptic maps of the solar photospheric magnetic field. The radial magnetic field maps are constructed from 720s cadence magnetograms originally recorded in high resolution and later remapped to the Carrington coordinate system.
- **Supporting Quote**: “In this paper we use the 3600×1440 HMI radial‐field synoptic maps … The HMI synoptic maps included in this paper cover Carrington rotations (CR) 2097−2207, i.e., the time interval from 2010.4 – 2018.7.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: High-Resolution HMI Synoptic Mapping
- **Time Range**: 2010.4 – 2018.7 (Carrington rotations CR 2097 – 2207)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the HMI synoptic maps included in this paper cover Carrington rotations (CR) 2097−2207, i.e., the time interval from 2010.4 – 2018.7.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly mentioned; however, HMI uses filtergrams in the visible spectrum (typically 6173 Å is standard, though this is not stated in the paper).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No explicit wavelength details are provided in the text.)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (pseudo-radial field derived from the original line-of-sight magnetograms)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the 4096×4096 HMI 720s LOS magnetograms are ﬁrst converted to pseudo-radial ﬁeld magnetograms…”
- **Additional Comments**: The original high-resolution maps (3600×1440) are degraded to several lower resolutions (360×180, 180×72, 120×48, and 72×30) to study the dependence of weak-field asymmetry on spatial resolution.
