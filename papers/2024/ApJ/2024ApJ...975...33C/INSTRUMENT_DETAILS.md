# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the nonthermal broadening of spectral lines in the solar transition region, focusing on the Si IV 1403 Å line. The study examines the relationship between nonthermal broadening and the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in closed-field regions above plage areas on the solar disk. Data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are used. The research aims to identify the physical processes responsible for nonthermal broadening, suggesting that velocity gradients within plasma flowing along magnetic fields may contribute significantly to the observed broadening.

## Instrumentation Details

### Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)
- **General Comments**:
   - IRIS is used to obtain Si IV 1403 Å spectra to study nonthermal broadening in the solar transition region. The data is collected in full-disk mosaic format, allowing for analysis of different viewing angles across the solar disk.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We obtained Si IV 1403 Å spectra from IRIS (B. De Pontieu et al. 2014) full-disk mosaic data and performed Gaussian fitting to determine several spectral parameters."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of active regions across the solar disk
- **Time Range**: 2013 October 21
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here, we use the data taken on 2013 October 21, when several well-developed active regions were distributed across the solar disk (see Figure 2), providing different viewing angles."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Si IV 1403 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The IRIS mosaic data contain six spectral windows (Mg II h, Mg II k, Si IV 1394, 1403 Å C II 1334, and 1335 Å). Among them, we selected the Si IV 1403 Å line to investigate the nonthermal broadening in the transition region."
- **Physical Observable**: Nonthermal broadening of spectral lines
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We obtained the nonthermal width of transition-region Si IV 1403 Å spectra observed in active regions by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, after subtraction of the thermal and instrumental line broadening."
- **Additional Comments**: The full-disk mosaic consists of 185 different pointings, with a field of view of about 128″ × 180″ for each pointing.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides full-disk photospheric vector magnetograms used to determine the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights through nonlinear force-free extrapolations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We determined the magnetic field direction at transition-region heights using nonlinear force-free extrapolations based on the observed photospheric vector magnetic field taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic field measurements for active regions
- **Time Range**: Specific observation times when IRIS slit passes through the center of the regions of interest
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We selected three different observation times when the IRIS slit passes through the center of the three rectangular areas and took the temporally closest HMI vector magnetograms as the boundary conditions."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric vector magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; J. Schou et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; W. D. Pesnell et al. 2012) provides full-disk photospheric vector magnetograms at a 12 minutes cadence."
- **Additional Comments**: The data is used to create a full-disk map of the inclination of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight.
