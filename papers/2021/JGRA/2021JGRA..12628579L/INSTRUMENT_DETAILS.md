## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how oscillations in the space plasma density affect the phase of laser signals used in gravitational wave (GW) detection by the TianQin space observatory. The study simulates the plasma‐induced phase deviation using a realistic spacecraft orbit simulator (GMAT) and a global plasma model (SWMF) with in-situ solar wind inputs. Key observational windows include campaigns during detection periods (when the orbital plane is nearly perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line, e.g. Aug-10-2034 and simulated plasma data from Aug-10-2000) and non-detection periods (when the orbital plane is nearly parallel to the Sun-Earth line, e.g. Oct-25-2034 with plasma data from Oct-25-2016). The instruments contribute critical data by specifying observation time ranges, wavelengths (using a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm), and monitoring physical observables such as plasma electron density and magnetic field strength – all of which underpin the validation of the error budget for GW detection via laser interferometry.

### 1. TianQin Laser Interferometer on board TianQin Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The TianQin mission employs a laser interferometer with two telescopes on each of its three geocentric spacecraft. The interferometric system uses an Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) to measure inter-spacecraft distance variations (~1.7×10^5 km arm length) with extremely high precision.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "provided the arm length is 1.7×10^5 km, the displacement measurement accuracy... should reach 1pm/Hz^1/2 at 10mHz" and "the wavelength of the adopted Nd:YAG laser" (from the Abstract and introductory sections).

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detection Period under Minor Magnetic Storm Conditions
- **Time Range**: 04:00 UT to 10:00 UT on Aug-10-2000  
   - *Supporting Quote*: "we picked the plasma densities along three laser arms from 4am to 10am on Aug-10-2000. A minor magnetic storm with Kp =5 started at 05:20 and persisted until 09:10 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1064 nm (Nd:YAG laser)  
   - *Supporting Quote*: "λ=1064 nm is the wavelength of the adopted Nd:YAG laser."
- **Physical Observable**: Laser phase deviation induced by plasma density oscillations measured in rad/Hz^1/2 (and the corresponding displacement noise ~pm/Hz^1/2).  
   - *Supporting Quote*: "the oscillating plasma density could cause the phase deviation close to 2×10^-6 rad/Hz^1/2 or 0.3pm/Hz^1/2 in the mHz frequency band."
- **Additional Comments**: This period uses simulated spacecraft orbits from Aug-10-2034 while plasma conditions from an in-situ event on Aug-10-2000 are applied to probe the plasma-induced phase noise during a detection scenario.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Non-Detection Period under Moderate Magnetic Storm Conditions
- **Time Range**: 01:00 UT to 11:30 UT on Oct-25-2016  
   - *Supporting Quote*: "Both the plasma density and the orbit data are picked from 01:00 to 11:30 UT" (for the non-detection period analysis using Oct-25-2016 plasma data and Oct-25-2034 orbit simulation).
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1064 nm remains in use.  
   - *Supporting Quote*: Implicit from instrument description.
- **Physical Observable**: Laser phase deviation as characterized by its Amplitude Spectral Density (ASD), reflecting differences among the three arms due to plasma density variations in different magnetospheric regions.  
   - *Supporting Quote*: "the phase ASD curves… show larger separation than those in [detection] period... due to the discrepancy of the plasma environment."
- **Additional Comments**: This simulation highlights the increased phase discrepancy among arms when the constellation’s orbital plane is aligned nearly parallel to the Sun-Earth line.
