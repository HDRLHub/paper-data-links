## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the calculation of accurate energies and radiative data for Rydberg states of neutral carbon (C I) using the Breit–Pauli R-matrix method. The study provides a complete dataset for transitions from states with principal quantum number n ≥ 5, comparing these with previously calculated values and finding good agreement within 10%, except for discrepancies with values recommended by NIST. The spectral line intensities originating from these Rydberg states are modeled under typical chromospheric conditions and compared with calibrated UV spectra from the SOHO SUMER instrument observing the quiet Sun. The comparison confirms the identification and blending of nearly 200 UV lines and results in numerous new identifications of C I lines. The study also estimates optical depth effects, which could explain much of the absorption observed in the spectra, and discusses the application of this atomic data in modeling a range of solar and astrophysical observations.

## Instrumentation Details

### Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SUMER is used to observe the UV spectrum of the quiet Sun, providing data essential for calibration and analysis of solar UV radiation. It operates in a spectral range of 660-1610 Å in the first order, with a spectral resolution of about 0.13 Å FWHM. The instrument can observe about 43 Å spectral windows at a time, which necessitates numerous lines for calibration across its entire spectral range.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the quiet Sun
- **Time Range**: Specific dates include 1997-04-20 and 1999-10-09 for detailed observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 660-1610 Å (first order)
- **Physical Observable**: UV spectra of the quiet Sun, focusing on the identification and analysis of C I lines and their blends.
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from SUMER are well-calibrated, with an accuracy within about 20%, and are crucial for the validation of theoretical models of solar UV emission, particularly for Rydberg states of neutral carbon.
