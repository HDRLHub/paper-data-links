1. SOHO/MDI on board SOHO  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was used to produce synoptic magnetograms of the Sun’s surface magnetic field. These observations were decomposed into spherical harmonic components (dipole, quadrupole, octupole) to measure the radial magnetic field (Br).  
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - Primary usage during sunspot Cycle 23: "August 1996 – December 2008 (Carrington Rotations CR 1913 – CR 2078)".  
     - Extended dataset: MDI data are available from the beginning of the magnetogram series starting in July 1996 (CR 1910) up until the instrument’s end-of-life data in December 2010 (CR 2104), with its overlap period with HMI described below.  
       - **Supporting Quote**: "Using synoptic magnetograms taken from MDI and HMI ... from July 1996 (CR 1910) to present. The two instruments observed the Sun over different time periods with an overlap from the beginning of HMI in May 2010 (CR 2097) until the end of MDI in December 2010 (CR 2104)."  
   - **Detectors / Observables**:  
     - The instrument measured the line-of-sight (projected radial) magnetic field, which was later remapped and decomposed into spherical harmonics (physical observables include the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole field strengths).  
     - Specific wavelengths or detector spectral bands are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

2. SDO/HMI on board SDO  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provides synoptic magnetograms of the Sun, similar to those from MDI. HMI data are used to continue the record of surface magnetic field measurements, capturing the evolution of the Sun’s magnetic topology (again decomposed into spherical harmonic orders).  
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - HMI observations began in May 2010 (CR 2097) and continue to at least January 2018 (CR 2199), covering sunspot Cycle 24.  
       - **Supporting Quote**: "The two instruments observed the Sun over different time periods with an overlap from the beginning of HMI in May 2010 (CR 2097) until the end of MDI in December 2010 (CR 2104)."  
     - Additionally, the total dataset includes 282 synoptic magnetograms covering Cycle 23 (from SOHO/MDI) and Cycle 24 up to January 2018 (from SDO/HMI).  
   - **Detectors / Observables**:  
     - Produces magnetograms (maps of the complete radial surface magnetic field, Br) that are later decomposed to extract axisymmetric (m = 0) and non-axisymmetric components for dipole, quadrupole, and octupole modes.
     - Specific wavelengths and detector details are not explicitly stated in the provided context.

3. ACE Spacecraft (Advanced Composition Explorer)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - The ACE spacecraft provides in-situ measurements of the solar wind properties at the L1 Lagrangian point, approximately 1.5 million km from Earth.  
     - It records key solar wind observables such as proton density, radial wind speed, and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, which are then used to infer the solar wind mass loss rate and the unsigned open magnetic flux.  
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - ACE has been performing in-situ monitoring since its arrival at L1 in December 1996, with data used continuously over the 22-year period covered by the study.  
       - **Supporting Quote**: "The ACE spacecraft has been performing in-situ monitoring of the fundamental solar wind properties since its arrival at the L1 Lagrangian point (on the Sun-Earth line, approximately 1.5 million km from Earth) in December 1996."  
   - **Detectors / Observables**:  
     - The ACE instruments include MAG (for magnetic field measurements) and SWEPAM (for solar wind plasma properties).  
     - Observables include solar wind speed, density, and magnetic field strength, which are used in 27-day averaged calculations to obtain a global mass loss rate and to estimate the unsigned open flux via the in-situ measurements of Br.  
     - No specific electromagnetic wavelengths are mentioned, as the focus is on in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements.

4. Ulysses Spacecraft  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - Ulysses made in-situ observations of the solar wind with a unique polar orbit, allowing the study of solar wind properties at different latitudes.  
     - Its data are used to complement ACE by providing estimates of the open magnetic flux, particularly during high-latitude (polar) passes when the spacecraft was within 2 AU of the Sun.  
   - **Time Ranges**:  
     - Ulysses performed three fast latitude scans (polar passes) with well-defined periods:  
       - 1st pass (minimum solar activity): "August 1994 – July 1995"  
       - 2nd pass (maximum solar activity): "November 2000 – September 2001"  
       - 3rd pass (minimum solar activity): "February 2007 – January 2008"  
       - **Supporting Quote**: "The Ulysses spacecraft made three fast latitude scans of the solar wind, each passing from the north pole to the south pole in approximately a year. These passes occurred between, August 1994 - July 1995, November 2000 - September 2001, and February 2007 - January 2008 ..."  
   - **Detectors / Observables**:  
     - Ulysses used instruments such as the FGM/VHM (fluxgate magnetometer/ vector helium magnetometer) and SWOOPS (Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun) to measure the solar wind’s magnetic field, speed, and density.  
     - These measurements contribute to the estimation of the solar open flux and the mass loss rate.  
     - As with ACE, there is no reference to specific electromagnetic wavelengths since the measurements pertain to in-situ plasma properties and magnetic fields.
