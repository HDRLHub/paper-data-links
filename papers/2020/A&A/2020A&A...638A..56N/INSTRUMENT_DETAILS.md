## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the connection between solar and stellar brightness variations by translating solar brightness measurements into passbands typical of stellar photometry. Using the SATIRE-S model, the authors simulate solar light curves as they would be observed in various broad-band filters—specifically those employed by the CoRoT, Kepler, TESS, and Gaia missions—and compare these with traditional total solar irradiance (TSI) and VIRGO/SPM measurements. The analysis covers several time intervals including a short 150-day period (JD 2456700–2456850, corresponding to 24 February 2014 – 11 July 2014) as well as longer-term cycle measurements spanning decades (e.g. cycles 22–24 from 1974 to 2019, and a 1000-day interval starting on July 26, 2013). In addition, the paper quantifies the effect of the observer’s inclination on the measured rotational variability, showing that both the filter system and the viewing geometry are essential in comparing solar variability with that of other stars.

   - “Gaia measures stellar brightness in three different channels (Gaia G, Gaia GBP, and Gaia GRP)… Gaia G is sensitive to photons between 350 and 1000 nm. Additionally, two prisms disperse the incoming light between 330 and 680 nm for the ‘Blue Photometer’ … and between 640–1050 nm for the ‘Red Photometer’.”
