# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the elemental composition and FIP bias in quiescent solar prominences. The study uses differential emission measure (DEM) techniques on UV observations to constrain plasma properties and determine if the prominence plasma has a photospheric or coronal origin. Observations were carried out using historical data from the SOHO/SUMER instrument during two MEDOC campaigns (one on 8 October 1999 and the other on 7–8 June 2004), complemented by quiet Sun measurements. In addition, the paper discusses upcoming instrumentation on the Solar Orbiter—specifically the UV spectrometer SPICE and the in-situ Solar Wind Analyser (SWA)—which are expected to further address issues related to prominence composition and solar-terrestrial connectivity.

### 1. SOHO/SUMER Instrument on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - This UV spectrometer operated on board SOHO and provided spectral data essential for the DEM analysis of both quiescent prominences and quiet Sun regions. It covered two wavelength orders: 780–1610 Å in first order and 390–805 Å in second order.
   - Its observations provided high spatial resolution (down to about 1″) and spectral resolution (ranging roughly from 45 mÅ/pixel at 800 Å to 41 mÅ/pixel at 1600 Å).
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The data used for this analysis are from the SOHO/SUMER instrument (Wilhelm et al. 1995) which operated in the UV 780–1610 Å (first order) and 390–805 Å (second order).”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence PRM1 Observations
- **Time Range**: 8 October 1999  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The ﬁrst prominence (a quiescent one), which we will call PRM1, was observed on 8 October 1999 during a MEDOC campaign.”
- **Detector & Observational Setup**:
   - **Slit Dimensions**: 0.3″ × 120″ positioned at the feature center. 
   - **Wavelengths**: Spectra covered from about 800 Å to 1600 Å.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... a sequence of exposures was made to obtain spectra from about 800 Å to 1600 Å (full details of the observation program can be found in Parenti et al. (2004)).”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Measurements include the total line radiances used for DEM inversion as well as spectroscopic diagnostics (line intensities, widths, and peak values) that inform on plasma temperature and density.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Prominence PRM04 Observations
- **Time Range**: 7–8 June 2004  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The second prominence, called PRM04, was observed using a similar observing program during a MEDOC campaign on the 7th and 8th June 2004.”
- **Detector & Observational Setup**:
   - **Slit Dimensions**: 1″ × 120″ used for observations.
   - **Wavelengths**: Covered similar UV spectral regions as in PRM1, allowing the recovery of key diagnostic lines for DEM analysis.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - As with PRM1, the observable properties include line intensities, profiles and spectral diagnostics that are compared with theoretical predictions to infer the elemental composition and plasma properties.

### 2. Solar Orbiter/SPICE Instrument on board Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
   - SPICE (Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment) is an upcoming UV spectrometer designed to obtain simultaneous spectral observations in distinct wavelength bands. Although not used for the current analysis, its capabilities are discussed in the paper as essential for future studies of prominence plasma.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “... we provide important elements for correctly interpreting the upcoming Solar Orbiter/SPICE spectroscopic data...”
- **Spectral Ranges**:
   - Will cover co-temporally the spectral ranges of 704–790 Å and 972–1005 Å (first order).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The SPICE spectrometer will cover, co-temporally, the spectral ranges 704–790 Å and 972–1005 Å (ﬁrst order).”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - SPICE is intended to observe several key lines (e.g., from C ii and C iii) that are used for determining abundance and FIP bias as well as for mapping temperature and density in the prominence and transition region plasma.
- **Time Range**: 
   - No specific observation dates are provided since SPICE is an upcoming instrument and its data are not part of the present study.

### 3. Solar Orbiter/SWA (Solar Wind Analyser) on board Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) is part of the in-situ suite on Solar Orbiter and is specifically designed to measure properties of the solar wind. It includes three sensors: the Electron Analyzer System (EAS), the Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS), and the Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS).
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “... the Solar Orbiter suite carries, among others, the UV spectrometer Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE, Caldwell et al. (2017)) and in-situ Solar Wind Analyser (SWA, Müller et al. (2013)) instruments, which are designed for this purpose. SWA is composed of three sensors: Electron Analyzer System (EAS), Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS) and Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS).”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - SWA is aimed at providing charge state information for heavy ions (such as Fe, Si, Mg, C, N, and O) and other in-situ solar wind parameters that are key to tracing and mapping the FIP bias from the sun into the heliosphere.
- **Time Range**: 
   - Specific time ranges are not given since SWA is mentioned as an upcoming instrument that will synergize with remote-sensing observations to map the solar wind back to its solar source.
