# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of operational solar flare forecasting methods by establishing standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics. It reviews how forecasting systems use various observational data to predict flare events, comparing methods on an array of statistics (e.g., TSS, Brier Skill Score, ROC and reliability diagrams). Many of the methods rely on solar magnetic field measurements provided by instruments operating on spacecraft and ground‐based facilities. The testing interval for the forecasts is defined as 01 January 2016 – 31 December 2017, although some instruments have contributed data over longer periods. In addition, the paper details the impact of changing and aging data sources (such as SDO/HMI) and supplementary measurements (e.g., GOES XRS for defining flare events) on the methods’ performance.

   - **Time Range**: 01 January 2016 – 31 December 2017
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “The participants provided forecasts for an agreed-upon interval … 01 January 2016 – 31 December 2017.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Although specific wavelengths are not stated, HMI records continuum and spectral line polarization data in the visible range.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (Derived from “magnetograms” and references to “line-of-sight” measurements.)
   - **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field and Doppler velocity.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... characterize coronal magnetic energy storage by proxy, with the parametrizations of photospheric magnetograms.”
   - **Additional Comments**: Near-real-time HMI data became available from late 2012, which supports operational forecasting.
- **Data Collection Period 2: Data Anomaly in Vector Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: April 2016 – September 2017
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “The impacted data spanned April 2016 – September 2017, and was most damaging for data away from disk center.”
   - **Wavelength(s) & Physical Observable**: As above; this period affected vector magnetic field data used by methods such as DAFFS and MAG4VW/VWF.
   - **Additional Comments**: This period of data misalignment highlights challenges in maintaining calibration across changing data acquisition modes.

### 3. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG is a ground-based network that provides continuous, full-disk magnetogram data of the Sun. It is employed by forecasting systems such as DAFFS-G to complement space-based observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “… the DAFFS-G tool runs simultaneously and is based primarily on GONG Blos data…”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Implicitly during the same operational testing interval (01 January 2016 – 31 December 2017)
      - **Supporting Quote**: The testing interval applies across forecast methods, including those based on GONG data.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided; GONG observes in visible wavelengths to capture line-of-sight magnetic field information.
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic fields.
- **Additional Comments**: GONG data are used as an alternative or backup to space-based magnetogram data, particularly in tools like DAFFS-G.

### 4. X-Ray Sensor (XRS) on board GOES
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES’s X-Ray Sensor is a critical instrument for defining solar flare events operationally by measuring the soft X-ray flux emanating from the Sun.
