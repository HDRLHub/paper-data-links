## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper identifies a local (≲5 Mpc) sample of short gamma‐ray bursts that are consistent with an origin in Magnetar Giant Flares (MGFs). The authors use a combination of archival and up‐to‐date GRB data from several gamma‐ray instruments to distinguish the burst properties—such as extremely short rise times (∼ms), spectral hardness, and lower isotropic energies—from the typical cosmological short GRB population. Associating these bursts with nearby, star‐forming galaxies strengthens the case for an MGF origin. The analysis utilizes prompt emission data, precise localization via multi-instrument triangulation, and an intrinsic energy probability distribution to assess the likelihood of an MGF hypothesis.
