# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates compact interplanetary radio type IV bursts observed at decameter–hectometer (DH) wavelengths during 2011–2012. Using radio dynamic spectra recorded by space‐borne instruments on the Wind, STEREO-A, and STEREO-B spacecraft, the authors compare these data with white-light coronagraph and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from instruments such as SOHO/LASCO, STEREO/EUVI, and SDO/AIA. The study focuses on several solar events—each with well‐defined observation time windows—that include flares, EUV waves, and fast halo CMEs. The analysis aims to determine the source regions of the DH type IV bursts and to understand the observed directivity, emphasizing how physical obstructions (e.g., dense corona or streamers associated with type II shocks) can block emissions in certain viewing directions.
