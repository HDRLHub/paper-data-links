## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the impact of imaging cadence on the kinematics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the K-Coronagraph at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory. The study focuses on ten CMEs, analyzing their average velocity and acceleration at various cadences (15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min). The research highlights the significant dependence of average acceleration on imaging cadence, with less impact on average velocity. The findings are crucial for designing observational campaigns for current and future missions targeting the inner corona, aiming to optimize cadence to capture essential kinematic features of CMEs effectively.

## Instrumentation Details

### K-Coronagraph on board Mauna Loa Solar Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The K-Coronagraph is utilized to observe the kinematics of CMEs in the inner corona, focusing on their initiation and propagation phases. The instrument's high cadence capability (as low as 15 seconds) is essential for capturing the dynamic acceleration phase of CMEs.

#### Data Collection Period 1: High cadence observation of CMEs
- **Time Range**: November 2014 â€“ September 2022
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light observations
- **Physical Observable**: CME kinematics (velocity and acceleration)
- **Additional Comments**: The study varied the imaging cadence to 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min using the original 15 s data to assess the impact on kinematic analysis accuracy.
