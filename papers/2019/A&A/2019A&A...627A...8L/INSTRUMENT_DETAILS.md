## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper develops and tests an empirical method for estimating the mass of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by analyzing the evacuated mass in low‐coronal EUV dimming regions and comparing it with white-light measurements. The study uses a sample of 32 CME events observed between 23 May 2010 and 17 April 2012. EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are combined with white-light observations from the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) to trace the evolution of CME mass from low to higher heliocentric distances. Additional instruments mentioned (used for flare timing and historical context) include GOES, the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), LASCO onboard SOHO, HMI onboard SDO, and MDI onboard SOHO.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is used to capture high-resolution EUV images of the Sun. In this study, AIA provides the data necessary to estimate the evacuated mass in coronal dimming regions via a differential emission measure (DEM) analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We analyzed 32 events identiﬁed in images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)...”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME-Associated EUV Dimming Observations
- **Time Range**: 23 May 2010 – 17 April 2012
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The events occurred between 23 May 2010 and 17 April 2012 when the STEREO spacecraft were nearly in quadrature with respect to the Sun-Earth direction.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å (Fe ix), 193 Å (Fe xii/Fe xxiv), and 211 Å (Fe xiv)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The DEM was constructed for the passbands of AIA centered at 171 Å (Fe ix), 193 Å (Fe xii/Fe xxiv), and 211 Å (Fe xiv).”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV dimming — the reduction in EUV intensity corresponding to mass loss in the low corona, used to infer the evacuated mass.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the mass evacuated by each CME in the low corona was estimated using a recently developed technique that analyzes the dimming in extreme-UV (EUV) images.”
- **Additional Comments**: The DEM technique applied with three narrowbands discards alternative mechanisms, ensuring that the measured intensity reduction is associated with actual mass loss.

### 2. COR2 Coronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - COR2 is a white-light coronagraph used to measure the mass of CMEs by tracking the brightness produced by Thomson scattering. In this study, it measures the CME mass evolution as the event moves through the coronagraph’s field of view.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the mass of the associated CMEs measured in white light [was determined] from COR2 on board STEREO.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Mass Measurements in White Light
- **Time Range**: 23 May 2010 – 17 April 2012
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The events occurred between 23 May 2010 and 17 April 2012 when the STEREO spacecraft were nearly in quadrature with respect to the Sun-Earth direction.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (observations based on Thomson scattering)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...determined from total-brightness images provided by the COR2 coronagraph...”
- **Physical Observable**: White-light brightness used to determine the CME mass via Thomson scattering formulation.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The mass of the white-light CMEs was determined through existing methods, while the mass evacuated by each CME in the low corona was estimated using... EUV images.”
- **Additional Comments**: A correction for the occulting disk effect is applied to account for mass hidden behind the occulter at lower heights.

### 3. COR1 Coronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - COR1 is the inner coronagraph complementary to COR2. It is used to monitor the evolution of the CME leading edge in the lower corona (typically for heights h ≤ 4 R⊙).
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The triangles indicate the mass loss (MEUV) in the coronal dimming region... as a function of the deprojected CME height in the FOV of COR1 (h ≤4 R⊙).”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Early Evolution and Low-Coronal Observations
- **Time Range**: 23 May 2010 – 17 April 2012 (implied, as used concurrently with other STEREO observations)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging (used to capture Thomson scattered light)
   - **Supporting Quote**: The description refers to using “the COR1 FOV” for early CME height measurements.
- **Physical Observable**: Early CME propagation and associated mass loss in the low corona.
- **Additional Comments**: The maximum height measured in the COR1 field-of-view is typically up to 4 R⊙, which helps in tracking the initial mass evacuation phase.

### 4. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is mentioned in the context of previous studies for determining CME mass. It is not directly used in this study’s analysis but provides historical context for white-light mass measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...Vourlidas et al. (2000) studied mass and energy of a sample of CMEs using data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).”
