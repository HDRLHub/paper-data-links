## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes solar radio bursts observed on June 5, 2020 using both space–based and ground–based instruments. The principal objective is to study a unique U+J+III association of solar radio bursts that were generated by active region NOAA AR 12765 located behind the solar limb with respect to the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The study exploits the high time–frequency resolution of ground–based instruments alongside the in situ measurements from the PSP spacecraft to refine the density model of the solar corona. Observations, conducted during PSP’s encounter phase at a distance of approximately 0.15 au (perihelion), include detailed spectral recordings as well as polarization analyses, helping to delineate the physical properties and propagation effects of low–frequency solar bursts.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. PSP FIELDS Instrument on board Parker Solar Probe
- **General Comments**:
   - The PSP FIELDS instrument is designed to measure electric and magnetic fields, radio waves, Poynting flux, plasma density, and electron temperature in the solar corona. It uses four 2‐meter long whip antennas (V1, V2, V3, and V4) made of niobium alloy mounted near the edge of the heat shield. The instrument includes two receivers: the Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and the High Frequency Receiver (HFR), which together cover a bandwidth of 10.5 kHz – 19.2 MHz.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Direct measurements of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, radio waves, Poynting ﬂux, absolute plasma density, as well as electron temperature are provided by the FIELDS instrument on PSP (Bale et al. 2016)… One Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) covers the bandwidth of 10.5 kHz – 1.7 MHz, and another High Frequency Receiver (HFR) has the bandwidth of 1.3 MHz – 19.2 MHz. Together they produce the data with the bandwidth of 10.5 kHz – 19.2 MHz."

#### Data Collection Period: Solar Event on June 5, 2020 (Encounter Phase)
- **Time Range**: Approximately 09:25:00 UT – 09:39:00 UT, June 5, 2020  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "As of June 5, 2020, PSP was in perihelion at the distance of ∼0.15 au from the Sun. This case is just the encounter phase."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 10.5 kHz – 19.2 MHz (combined from LFR & HFR)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Together they produce the data with the bandwidth of 10.5 kHz – 19.2 MHz."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar radio bursts, including the U, J, and type III bursts and associated polarization properties.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Parker Solar Probe detects solar radio bursts related with a behind–the–limb active region" and further discussion on the burst association observed in the spectrogram.
- **Additional Comments**: The HFR data are recorded at a cadence of one spectrum per ∼7 s during the encounter phase, although the overall time–frequency resolution does not enable isolation of every individual type III burst group.
