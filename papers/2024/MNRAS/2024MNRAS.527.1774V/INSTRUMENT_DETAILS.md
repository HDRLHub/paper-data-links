## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses a detailed analysis of a prominence eruption (PE) that occurred on December 4, 2013, using multi-point observations from various instruments. The study focuses on the eruption process, the associated coronal mass ejection (CME), and the subsequent radio bursts. The prominence pre-existed as an inverse-S shaped filament lying above fragmented opposite polarities between two active regions. The eruption was initiated by the loss of equilibrium due to flux emergence at one leg of the prominence, leading to a slow upward motion followed by a fast rise. The CME was observed to accelerate and then decelerate in the extended field of view of STEREO-A. The study emphasizes the influence of magnetic reconnection on the CME speed and the launch of type II and III radio bursts.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides continuous full-disc observations of the chromosphere and corona in multiple EUV channels, which helps in studying the dynamics of solar phenomena like flares and prominence eruptions.

- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO provides white light images"
- **Physical Observable**: CME dynamics
   - **Supporting Quote**: "to analyse CME dynamics in the near-Sun corona."

### Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) on board Solar-Terrestrial and Relational Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI includes multiple instruments like EUVI, COR1, COR2, and HI1, which provide imaging observations from the Sun to the inner heliosphere.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of CME propagation from the Sun to inner heliosphere
- **Time Range**: 2013-12-04, specific times not detailed for all instruments

### Ground-based Hα and radio observations
- **General Comments**:
   - Observations include Hα imaging and radio spectrograph data, which are essential for understanding the chromospheric conditions and radio emissions associated with solar eruptions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the prominence in Hα and associated radio bursts
- **Time Range**: 2013-12-04, specific times for Hα not detailed; radio bursts observed around 05:12 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We also use Hα 6564 Å observations" and "the radio spectrum present with type III burst starting from 05:12 UT."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "Hα 6564 Å" and "radio bursts of type III"
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence in Hα and radio bursts
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Hα show the kinked prominence as bright feature against the coronal background" and "radio bursts of type III as recorded by the ground-based radio spectrograph."

This detailed instrumentation and observation data provide a comprehensive view of the tools and methods used to study the prominence eruption and associated phenomena.
