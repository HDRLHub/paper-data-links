# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the source of major solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with active region (AR) 11944, occurring in January 2014. By combining remote-sensing spectroscopic data with in situ particle measurements, the authors link the high Si/S abundance ratios observed near Earth with specific plasma regions at the footpoints of hot coronal loops within the AR. The study leverages multiple instruments and observing techniques––each with unique capabilities, time ranges, detectors, and spectral coverage––to identify and characterize the plasma composition and magnetic field properties that lead to SEP production. Key observation periods span from early to mid-January 2014, with detailed instrument-specific intervals and associated wavelengths/detectors fundamental to the study’s conclusions.
