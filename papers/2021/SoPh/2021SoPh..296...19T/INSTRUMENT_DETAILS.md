## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the signatures of the Gnevyshev gap (GG) in various indices of solar and geomagnetic activity across even and odd solar cycles (SC17–SC24). It uses multiple long‐term observational data sets to compare sunspot-group area measurements, interplanetary magnetic‐field and solar-wind parameters from near-Earth spacecraft (via the OMNI2 data set), and several geomagnetic indices (Dst, Dxt, Dcx, and Ap). Critical time intervals during each solar cycle—the declining phases marked by the GG—are identified and statistically compared with periods before and after the gap. The integrated analysis of physical observables (sunspot areas, magnetic field intensity, solar wind velocity, and geomagnetic disturbances) provides insight into the solar cycle evolution and the physical processes connecting solar activity to near-Earth space weather.

### 1. Sunspot Group Area Measurements from Ground-based Observatories
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument depends on ground-based measurements of sunspot-group areas. The primary data comes from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) for the period 1874–1976, later supplemented by data from the Kislovodsk, Pulkovo, and Debrecen observatories until October 2019.
   - The physical observable is the sunspot-group area (measured in millionths of the solar hemisphere) used to study the two-peak structure and the gap (GG) in solar activity.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The main data for this data set are the Royal Greenwich observatory (RGO) measurements between 1874 – 1976. The years after 1976 until October 2019 were constructed from the data sets from the Kislovodsk, Pulkovo, and Debrecen observatories.”

### 2. OMNI2 Data Set Measurements of Interplanetary Magnetic Field and Solar-Wind Plasma
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI2 data set aggregates hourly and daily averages from various spacecraft near Earth, providing measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and solar-wind plasma properties.
   - The key physical observables are the magnetic-field intensity (|B|) and the solar-wind bulk velocity.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The OMNI2 data set contains the hourly mean values of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) and solar-wind plasma parameters measured by various spacecraft near the Earth’s orbit… we use daily averages of the absolute value of the magnetic-field intensity B and solar-wind bulk velocity for the years 1964 – 2020 (Solar Cycles 20 – 24).”

#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: 1964 – 2020 (covering Solar Cycles 20–24)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...for the years 1964 – 2020 (Solar Cycles 20 – 24).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; these are in situ plasma and magnetic-field measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Measurements are of physical field and velocity, not optical wavelengths.)
- **Physical Observable**: Interplanetary magnetic-field intensity (|B|) and solar-wind velocity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...daily averages of the absolute value of the magnetic‐field intensity B and solar-wind bulk velocity…”

- **Additional Comments**: These measurements are essential for relating solar conditions to geomagnetic disturbances observed at Earth.

### 3. Dst-Index (Storm-Time Disturbance Index)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Dst-index is calculated from data obtained by four low-latitude magnetic observatories (Hermanus, Honolulu, Kakioka, and San Juan) and is a key indicator of the global geomagnetic storm activity.
   - It mainly captures negative disturbances due to magnetic reconnection and ring current formation.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The Dst (storm-time disturbance) index has been calculated at the World Data Center C2 at Kyoto, Japan, since the International Geophysical Year 1957, using data from four observatories at low latitudes (Hermanus, Honolulu, Kakioka, and San Juan).”

#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Since 1957 (used in this study for Solar Cycles 20–23)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...calculated … since the International Geophysical Year 1957” and “Dst-index exists only since 1957… we can show only total Solar Cycles 20 – 23 for Dst.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The index is derived from geomagnetic field measurements.)
- **Physical Observable**: Geomagnetic disturbances associated with the ring current.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Positive values of Dst are mainly due to the compression of the dayside magnetosphere... negative values are due to magnetic reconnection and the formation of the storm-related currents.”
- **Additional Comments**: This index is used to evaluate the decline in geomagnetic activity during the GG intervals.

### 4. Dxt-Index (Extended Dst-Index)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Dxt-index is an extension of the Dst-index, incorporating additional data from earlier periods to correct identified issues in the original index.
   - It integrates observations from the original four low-latitude stations for 1941–1956 and utilizes data from the nearby Cape Town station for 1932–1940.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The Dxt-index is an extension of Dst using data from the original set of four low-latitude stations for 1941 – 1956, and using the nearby Cape Town station as a predecessor of the Hermanus station for 1932 – 1940.”

#### Data Collection Periods
- **Time Range 1**: 1932 – 1940 
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...using the nearby Cape Town station as a predecessor of the Hermanus station for 1932 – 1940.”
- **Time Range 2**: 1941 – 1956 (and continuing the series later overlapping with original Dst)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...data from the original set of four low-latitude stations for 1941 – 1956.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No wavelength details are provided.)

   - **Supporting Quote**: (The index measures storm-time magnetic disturbances with corrections.)
- **Additional Comments**: The extended Dxt-index has been used in subsequent analyses comparing different storm phases.

### 5. Dcx-Index (Corrected Dst-Index)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Dcx-index is a further correction of the Dst-index that removes the seasonal variation of the quiet-time (non-storm) component, yielding a cleaner measure of storm-related disturbances.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Dcx-index is an extended and corrected version of the Dst-index such that it also corrects the Dst-(and Dxt-)index for the excessive, seasonal varying quiet-time level, the so-called ‘non-storm component’...”
   
#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Used for Solar Cycles 17–23 (with data spanning a similar period as Dxt)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...we analyze the Dcx, Dxt, and Dst- indices for each Solar Cycle 17 – 23…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (This index is based on magnetic field measurements, not electromagnetic wavelengths.)
- **Physical Observable**: Corrected geomagnetic disturbances isolating storm-related signals.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...corrects the Dst-index for the excessive, seasonal varying quiet-time level…”
- **Additional Comments**: The Dcx-index offers improved sensitivity by reducing seasonal biases in the geomagnetic activity record.

### 6. Ap-Index (Planetary Geomagnetic Activity Index)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Ap-index is derived from a collection of 3-hourly geomagnetic field variations measured at 13 observatories distributed across a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes.
   - It is used to assess the daily level of mid-latitude magnetic activity and is available for Solar Cycles 17–23, with preliminary values for Solar Cycle 24.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Planetary geomagnetic activity index [Ap] is derived from a range of geomagnetic ﬁeld variations over a period of three hours from measurements provided by 13 geomagnetic observatories… We use here daily averages of the Ap-index… The Ap-index exists for Solar Cycles 17 – 23, and nowadays also, at least as preliminary values, for Solar Cycle 24.”

#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Solar Cycles 17–23, with preliminary values available for Solar Cycle 24.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...for Solar Cycles 17 – 23, and nowadays also, at least as preliminary values, for Solar Cycle 24.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (This is a geomagnetic index, so no optical wavelengths are involved.)
- **Physical Observable**: Geomagnetic field variations reflecting overall mid-latitude geomagnetic activity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...a measure of the daily level of the mid-latitude magnetic activity.”
- **Additional Comments**: The Ap-index is used to compare the timing and significance of geomagnetic declines with the observed Gnevyshev gap in solar indices.
