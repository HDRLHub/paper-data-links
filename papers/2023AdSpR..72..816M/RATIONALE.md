produce the script. We need to focus on the specific requirements and constraints provided by the context of the study on type II radio bursts and their correlation with various solar and heliospheric parameters during solar cycle 24. The key points to consider are:

1. **Time Range**: The study covers the period from 2010 to 2017. This period should be defined in our script to ensure that the data queries are restricted to this timeframe.
2. **Frequency Range**: The frequency range of interest is 20 MHz to 200 MHz. This is crucial as it defines the type of data we need to query, specifically focusing on radio bursts.
3. **Instrument**: The CALLISTO spectrometer network is the primary instrument used in the study. However, since CALLISTO data might not be directly accessible via SunPy's Fido, we need to consider how to approach this. If not available, we might need to note this limitation.
4. **Physical Observable**: The focus is on type II radio bursts with band splitting, which are significant for understanding solar eruption dynamics.

Given these points, the script will aim to query data that matches the time and frequency range specified, using the appropriate instrument if available in the VSO interface provided by SunPy. If CALLISTO is not available, this will be noted, and alternative suggestions or manual data access methods might be recommended.
