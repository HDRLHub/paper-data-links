## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper titled "The Structure of Coronal Mass Ejections Recorded by the K-Coronagraph at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory" by Hongqiang Song et al. focuses on the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their structures as observed through various instruments. The study spans observations from September 2013 to November 2022, examining 369 CMEs to understand why only a fraction exhibit the typical three-part structure in high corona. The research utilizes data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the K-Coronagraph (K-COR) at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The findings suggest that while 90-100% of CMEs show the three-part structure in the lower corona, only 30-40% retain this structure in the higher corona, supporting the theory that most CMEs initially have magnetic flux rope (MFR) structures which may evolve during propagation.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA is used to capture images of the Sun in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels, providing detailed views of solar phenomena like hot channels and prominences which are integral in studying the sources and structures of CMEs.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of CMEs
- **Time Range**: Continuous observation, specific events from 2013 September to 2022 November
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In total, 369 CMEs are observed from 2013 September to 2022 November."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å (Fe XXI, ~10 MK) and 304 Å (He II, ~0.05 MK)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here we use the 131 Å (Fe XXI, ~10 MK) and 304 Å (He II, ~0.05 MK) to display the hot channel and prominence, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Hot channels and prominences
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In general, hot channels and coronal cavities are regarded as the proxies of MFRs in active regions and quiet-Sun regions, respectively."

### K-Coronagraph (K-COR) at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - K-COR is crucial for recording the polarization brightness (pB) of the corona, which helps in understanding the structural evolution of CMEs in the lower corona.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed observation of CME structures
- **Time Range**: 2013 September 30 to 2022 November 27
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The K-COR data are available since 2013 September 30, while the coronagraph is closed temporarily due to the volcanic eruption of Mauna Loa on 2022 November 27."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 7200–7500 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Records the coronal polarization brightness (pB) in the passband of 7200–7500 Å."
- **Physical Observable**: Polarization brightness (pB) indicating Thomson scattering from free electrons
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Records the coronal polarization brightness (pB) in the passband of 7200–7500 Å, which is formed by Thomson scattering of photospheric light from free electrons."

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used to observe the structure of CMEs in the outer corona, providing a comparison to the lower corona observations from K-COR.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CME structures in the outer corona
- **Time Range**: Continuous observation, specific events from 2013 September to 2022 November
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here the C2 (FOV: 2–6 R⊙) is adopted to observe the CME structure in the outer corona."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Comprises of three telescopes (C1, C2 and C3), each of which has an increasingly large FOV."
- **Physical Observable**: CME structures in white-light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here the C2 (FOV: 2–6 R⊙) is adopted to observe the CME structure in the outer corona."

These instruments collectively provide a comprehensive view of CMEs from their early stages in the lower corona to their propagation into the outer corona, supporting the study's conclusions about the evolution of CME structures.
