# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents an improved magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on December 13, 2006, in the emerging Î´-sunspot active region NOAA 10930. The improvements over previous simulations include incorporating an ambient solar wind and imposing a random electric field at the lower boundary to represent turbulent convection. The study models synthetic soft X-ray images that would be observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on the Hinode satellite, comparing these with actual observations. The simulation aims to better understand the magnetic field evolution and the mechanisms driving the CME, including the role of the torus and kink instabilities.

## Instrumentation Details

### X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - The XRT on the Hinode satellite was used to observe the soft X-ray emissions from the coronal magnetic field of the active region. The synthetic images produced by the simulation were compared with the actual XRT observations to validate the model.
- **Supporting Quote**: "With the inclusion of this heating, which depends on the magnetic field topology, we are able to model the synthetic soft X-ray images that would be observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) of the Hinode satellite, produced by the simulated coronal magnetic field."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-eruption phase
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the context
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We find that the simulated pre-eruption magnetic field with the build up of a twisted magnetic flux rope, produces synthetic soft X-ray emission that shows qualitatively similar morphology as that observed by the Hinode/XRT for both the ambient coronal loops of the active region and the central inverse-S shaped 'sigmoid' that sharpens just before the onset of the eruption."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray
   - **Supporting Quote**: "With the inclusion of this heating, which depends on the magnetic field topology, we are able to model the synthetic soft X-ray images that would be observed by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) of the Hinode satellite, produced by the simulated coronal magnetic field."
- **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray emission from coronal magnetic fields
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The synthetic post-flare loop brightening also shows similar morphology as that seen in the Hinode/XRT image during the impulsive phase of the eruption."

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI on the SOHO spacecraft provided the photospheric magnetogram data used to initialize the simulation's lower boundary conditions.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Fan (2016) modeled the pre-eruption magnetic field by imposing at the lower boundary the (partial) emergence of an east-west oriented magnetic torus into an initial potential coronal magnetic field extrapolated from a smoothed magnetogram from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) about 6 hours before the flare."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-eruption phase
- **Time Range**: 20:51:01 UT on December 12, 2006
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The white boxed region on the MDI full-disk magnetogram at 20:51:01 UT on December 12 (Figure 1(a)) is extracted as the lower boundary of the spherical wedge simulation domain."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The white boxed region on the MDI full-disk magnetogram at 20:51:01 UT on December 12 (Figure 1(a)) is extracted as the lower boundary of the spherical wedge simulation domain."

### Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - The SOT on the Hinode satellite provided vector magnetograms used in previous studies to model the pre-eruption magnetic field evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Amari et al. (2014) modeled the pre-eruption magnetic field evolution by constructing a sequence of force-free field solutions extrapolated from the observed photosphere vector magnetograms from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) of Hinode."

### Magnetic Flux Eruption (MFE) Code
- **General Comments**:
   - The MFE code was used to solve the semi-relativistic MHD equations for the simulation, incorporating the effects of thermal conduction, radiative cooling, and coronal heating.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this simulation, we use the 'Magnetic Flux Eruption' (MFE) code to solve the set of semi-relativistic MHD equations as described in Fan (2017)."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "In this simulation, we use the 'Magnetic Flux Eruption' (MFE) code to solve the set of semi-relativistic MHD equations as described in Fan (2017)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field evolution, thermal conduction, radiative cooling, coronal heating
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Compared to the previous simulation of Fan (2016), a more sophisticated treatment of the thermodynamics is used where the internal energy equation explicitly takes into account the non-adiabatic effects in the corona, including the field-aligned thermal conduction, optically thin radiative cooling, and coronal heating."
