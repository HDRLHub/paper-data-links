## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents numerical modeling of particle acceleration at coronal shocks propagating through a streamer-like magnetic field. The study uses a kinematic description of an expanding circular shock and an analytical magnetic field configuration to determine how different regions along the shock front accelerate particles to energies from ∼1 MeV up to ∼1 GeV. In addition to the simulation details and theoretical parameter studies (involving the streamer tilt angle, diffusion coefficients, and shock compression ratio), the authors compare simulated particle spectra in a streamer-like configuration with those in a radial magnetic field. The work also discusses observational contexts by referencing various remote-sensing instruments that have recorded features of CMEs and related shock interactions, especially in association with ground level enhancement (GLE) events dated 2012 May 17 and 2017 September 10.
