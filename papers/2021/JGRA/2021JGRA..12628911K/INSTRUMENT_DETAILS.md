# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a new physics‐driven model (ANTEATR-PARADE) for simulating the interplanetary expansion and deformation of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The work builds upon earlier models by combining drag, magnetic, and thermal forces to evolve the CME geometry and internal parameters from near the Sun (starting at about 10 Rs) to Earth (1 AU). The paper discusses both remote‐sensing and in situ observations used in the literature to constrain CME evolution. While the focus is on model development and sensitivity studies, the paper references several observational instruments and missions that have contributed to our understanding of CME morphology, kinematics, and internal structure.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Coronagraphs on STEREO Satellites
- **General Comments**:
  - These instruments are referenced as essential in providing routine observations of CMEs from an off–Sun–Earth line perspective.
  - They capture coronal images in visible light (and by implication, sometimes in extreme ultraviolet) that help study the source regions and early evolution of Earth-impacting CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “...but routine observations from offthe Sun-Earth line are limited to the coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers on the STEREO satellites.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
    - **Supporting Quote**: There is no detailed start or end date provided for these observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Primarily visible light (with additional measurements sometimes in extreme ultraviolet as indicated by comparisons with Earth-based coronagraph imaging).
    - **Supporting Quote**: “We tend to have an abundance of coronal images from the Earth’s perspective, both in visible light and the extreme ultraviolet...”
- **Physical Observable**:
  - CME structure including source region, early evolution, and morphology.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - These observations have been used over nearly half a century to study CMEs, although the text does not provide specific observation dates.

### 2. Heliospheric Imagers on STEREO Satellites
- **General Comments**:
  - Along with coronagraphs, the heliospheric imagers on STEREO provide additional perspectives for tracking CME propagation.
  - Their role is highlighted in contrasting with Earth‐based imaging, as they offer off-axis views that are critical for understanding interplanetary evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...but routine observations from offthe Sun-Earth line are limited to the coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers on the STEREO satellites.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified.
    - **Supporting Quote**: The paper does not mention a specific start or end date for the heliospheric imaging observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not stated explicitly; by inference, these instruments operate in wavelengths similar to coronagraphs (visible light and possibly extreme ultraviolet components).
- **Physical Observable**:
  - CME propagation dynamics and large-scale structural evolution.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - These instruments complement the coronagraph observations, providing critical 3D context though the precise observation period is not provided.

### 3. WIND In Situ Instrumentation
- **General Comments**:
  - The WIND spacecraft’s in situ measurements are cited for deducing local CME axis orientations and internal properties.
  - WIND data from 1 AU have been used in the literature to validate CME models and to infer structural details from long-term observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Janvier et al. (2013) use in situ measurements to infer the local axis orientation of CME from 15 years of WIND observations at 1 AU...”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: A 15-year observational period, though specific start and end dates are not provided.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “...from 15 years of WIND observations at 1 AU...”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not applicable (these are in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements rather than electromagnetic imaging).
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Local magnetic field orientation, density, and plasma properties within CMEs.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - This long-term dataset has provided valuable constraints on CME models; however, the paper does not specify exact dates for the WIND observation period.

### 4. Remote Instruments on Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
  - The paper mentions that Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter will provide “exciting remote observations” from new vantage points.
  - These missions are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of CME evolution from perspectives that are not available from the Earth–Sun line.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter will provide exciting remote observations from new angles and distances but will not give the consistent off-axis perspective needed to better understand the interplanetary evolution of CMEs.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified.
    - **Supporting Quote**: No specific observation dates or intervals for these missions are provided in the text.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - The specific spectral ranges are not detailed in the text.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Remote imaging of CME initiation and propagation.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - These instruments represent upcoming or ongoing observational capabilities that aim to complement existing data.

### 5. Helios 1 and Helios 2 Instrumentation
- **General Comments**:
  - The Helios missions provided measurements of the solar wind proton temperature, which are used to derive an empirical relation for the background solar wind temperature.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...this empirical form was derived from Helios 1 and 2 measurements of the average proton temperature between 0.3 and 1 AU.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not provided as calendar dates; rather, the temperature measurements span solar wind conditions between 0.3 and 1 AU.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “...between 0.3 and 1 AU.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not applicable (these are particle and plasma measurements rather than electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Proton temperature and associated solar wind plasma properties.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Although the paper uses these measurements to set background solar wind conditions, no explicit observational dates or duration are given.

### 6. Additional Mention of Future/Other Space Missions (MESSENGER and Venus Express)
- **General Comments**:
  - The paper briefly notes that further validation of the model could be performed using in situ observations from planetary missions such as MESSENGER or Venus Express.
  - These missions (along with Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter) are mentioned as opportunities for testing the model against data from different heliocentric distances.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...or with planetary missions such as MESSENGER or Venus Express or with Parker Solar Probe or Solar Orbiter observations would be critical for validating the full model...”
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**: Not specified in the paper.
    - **Supporting Quote**: The text does not provide specific observation dates or ranges for these missions.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not applicable; these missions collect a variety of data types (often including in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements) rather than broad-band electromagnetic images.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - For these missions, observables include in situ magnetic fields, plasma densities, and temperatures that can be used to further constrain CME propagation models.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Although mentioned as valuable for future validation efforts, the paper does not detail their specific observational setups or collection periods.
