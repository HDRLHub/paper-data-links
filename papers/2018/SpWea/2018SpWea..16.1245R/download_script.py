This script demonstrates how to query the Virtual Solar Observatory using SunPy for GOES X‑ray Sensor (XRS) data.
In the context of CME forecast studies, the GOES X‑ray sensor is used to capture the evolution of a solar flare,
which provides a proxy for the piston‐driving phase of a CME eruption.
For this example, we set a sample time range during which a flare might occur.
Note: The Fido.fetch command is provided but commented out to adhere to the directive.
