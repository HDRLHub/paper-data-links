## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the evolution and magnetic field structure of an intermediate solar filament associated with an active region/quiet Sun polarity inversion line. The study combines multi-wavelength observations with nonlinear force‐free field (NLFFF) modeling using the flux rope insertion method. The observational analysis covers key data from the photosphere to the corona over a well‐defined period—from 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT until 2012 August 6 at 08:00 UT—when the filament was in a stable (equilibrium) phase. Data from instruments sensitive to extreme-ultraviolet emission, magnetic field measurements, and Hα imaging are compared with computed magnetic field models. The instruments further provide timing for eruptive events (via coronagraphs) and estimate physical parameters such as plasma temperature, filament height, and magnetic flux evolution. These combined observations support the idea that flux cancellation and associated reconnection inject axial flux into the filament’s supporting flux rope.

- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument provides multi-temperature EUV observations to study the evolution and dynamics of the filament plasma along its spine and barbs. It is key to observing both the heating events (activation episodes) and fine helical threads that also help in constraining the NLFFF models.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The evolution and dynamics of the filament plasma are studied during its disk passage using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012).”

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI supplies full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms which are used to study the photospheric magnetic field evolution in both the active region and the quiet Sun. These data serve as the lower boundary condition to construct the NLFFF models via the flux rope insertion method.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The photospheric field evolution of AR 11541 and the quiet sun photosphere above which the filament resides is studied using the HMI 720 s cadence data series (Hoeksema et al. 2014; Couvidat et al. 2016).”

### 3. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) – Hα Imager
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG provides Hα images that are used to study the filament’s structure, including its barbs and overall orientation, which is also used to infer its chirality.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Hα images taken from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG; Harvey et al. 2011) are also used to study the filament evolution and the orientation of its barbs to determine the chirality sign of the filament.”
    
#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament Morphology and Chirality Analysis
- **Time Range**: Although the exact observing times are not stated explicitly for GONG Hα data, they are applied in the same context of the filament observations during the period when the filament is in equilibrium (i.e. around 2012 August 4 at 23:00 UT and August 6 at 08:00 UT).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “A Hα image from the GONG Network shows the filament and locations of the four ARs in the AR complex...” (see Figure 1 caption).

   - STEREO-B/EUVI provides complementary EUV imaging from a different vantage point (approximately 114.8° away from the Sun-Earth line) and is used to estimate the filament height.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Data taken by the Extreme UltraViolet Imager on board the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-B (STEREO-B/EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004; Howard et al. 2008) are used to calculate the height of the filament when it is seen at the west limb from the STEREO-B viewpoint.”
