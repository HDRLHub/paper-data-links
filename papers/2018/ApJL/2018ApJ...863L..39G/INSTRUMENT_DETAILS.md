## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the extraordinary kinematics of the 2017 September 10 solar eruption and its associated ground level enhancement (GLE) event. By combining observations from multiple space- and ground-based instruments, the study tracks the rapid acceleration, extremely high speeds, and shock formation of a coronal mass ejection (CME) as well as the timing and spectral characteristics of accelerated energetic particles. Precise time markers (e.g., flare onset around ~15:40 UT, type II burst onset at 15:53 UT, first appearance of the CME at 16:00 UT, CME acceleration ceasing at 16:18 UT, and GLE onset at 16:08 UT) are used to correlate remote sensing observations (in EUV, white-light, radio) with in-situ particle measurements, thereby shedding light on the interplay between solar eruptions and particle acceleration processes.

### 2. SECCHI Package on board STEREO-Ahead (STA) – EUVI, COR1, and COR2 Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - The SECCHI suite on STEREO-Ahead includes an EUV Imager (EUVI) and two coronagraphs (COR1 and COR2) that together capture the eruption’s evolution from the low corona to the outer corona. Their multi-view observations assist in three-dimensional reconstruction of the CME and its shock.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The CME and the leading shock were observed by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI, Howard et al. 2008) on board the Ahead spacecraft (STA) of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission. The eruption was observed by SECHHI’s EUV Imager (EUVI), COR1 (inner coronagraph) and COR2 (outer coronagraph).”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Early CME Appearance in COR1
- **Time Range**: Starting at 16:00 UT as seen in the STA/COR1 field of view.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME first appeared at 16:00 UT in the LASCO/C2 FOV and STA/COR1 FOV.”

### 3. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO uses its C2 and C3 coronagraph telescopes to monitor the white-light corona and track the CME evolution in the outer corona, providing key profiles for height-time and kinematic analysis.

- **Time Range**: The CME first appears at 16:00 UT in the LASCO/C2 field of view; subsequent measurements extend at least until 16:18 UT (when the acceleration ceased).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME first appeared in the LASCO/C2 FOV at 16:00 UT at a height of 2.93 Rs … By the time the acceleration ceased (16:18 UT), the shock speed was ~4191±272 km s-1.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (coronagraph observations).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph …”
- **Physical Observable**: White-light intensity used for tracking the CME leading edge, its height-time history, and reconstruction of the shock front.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME/shock height-time (h-t) history from the fit and LASCO sky-plane measurements are shown …”
- **Additional Comments**: The LASCO measurements are also used in quadratic and linear fits to derive speeds and acceleration profiles.

### 4. CALLISTO Instrument at Kangerlussuaq (Greenland)
- **General Comments**:
   - The CALLISTO spectrometer observes low-frequency radio emissions, capturing metric type II bursts and associated phenomena such as type III bursts and a type IV continuum, which serve as a proxy for shock formation in the corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The first shock signature was a metric type II radio burst at 15:53 UT observed by the Kangerlussuaq (Greenland) CALLISTO …”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Metric Type II Burst and Subsequent Episodes
- **Time Range**: Begins at 15:53 UT (initial burst at 90 MHz) with additional episodes at 16:04 UT and 16:08 UT, and continues until ~16:24 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Episode of metric type II emission from CALLISTO starting at 15:53 UT (90 MHz)… Additional episodes … at 16:04 and 16:08 UT and a broad-band structure before ending around 16:24 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Metric radio frequencies; explicitly mentions 90 MHz and signals at frequencies above 25 MHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “(90 MHz)” and “… continued metric type II episodes at frequencies above 25 MHz until 16:24 …”
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emission signatures including metric type II bursts (indicative of shock formation), type III bursts, and type IV continuum.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The vertical features are type III bursts superposed on a type IV continuum.”
- **Additional Comments**: Despite the lack of spatial information, the accurate timing of these radio bursts helps constrain the shock formation height.

### 6. GOES-13 Particle Detectors (and Associated GOES Channels)
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES-13 monitors energetic particles in various protons energy channels. Its high-energy measurements (including channels >700 MeV) are critical for characterizing the SEP event and confirming the ground level enhancement (GLE) onset.
- **Supporting Quote**:

- **Time Range**: Observations indicate an onset around 16:05 UT with the GLE intensity reaching 10% of its peak at 16:08 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The GLE intensity was at 10% of its peak at 16:08 UT … The 5-min data in the GOES-13 highest energy channels … indicate a slightly earlier onset (16:05 UT).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; these are energy channels for detecting charged particles (with energy ranges provided: 420–510 MeV, 510–700 MeV, and >700 MeV).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “the 5-min data in the GOES-13 highest energy channels (420 to 510 MeV, 510 to 700 MeV, and >700 MeV) …”

### 7. Oulu Neutron Monitor (Ground-Based)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Oulu Neutron Monitor records neutron count increases that are directly related to ground level enhancements (GLEs) resulting from energetic particles penetrating the Earth’s atmosphere.

   - “The GLE was observed by several neutron monitors, including the one in Oulu … recording a 4.4%-increase above the background.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: GLE Measurement
- **Time Range**: The key measurement for the GLE is tied to the 16:08 UT onset time when the increase in neutron count was recorded.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The GLE intensity was at 10% of its peak at 16:08 UT …”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; this is a particle detector measuring secondary neutrons.
- **Physical Observable**: Neutron count rate increase indicative of the GLE (approximately 4.4% above background, with alternate estimates around 6% from other neutron monitors).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… recording a 4.4%-increase above the background.”
- **Additional Comments**: The neutron monitor data support the determination of the GLE intensity, thereby complementing the in-situ particle detectors on GOES.
