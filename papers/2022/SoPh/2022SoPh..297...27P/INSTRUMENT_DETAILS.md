## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the development and application of a Simple Radial Gradient Filter (SiRGraF) for processing white-light coronagraph images to enhance the visibility of the K-corona by reducing the radial intensity gradient. The study focuses on the separation of the K- and F-corona components and the enhancement of transient coronal structures such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The algorithm was tested on images from various coronagraphs, including LASCO-C2 onboard SOHO, COR-2A and COR-1A onboard STEREO, and the KCoronagraph (KCor) at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO). The performance of SiRGraF was compared with the existing Normalising Radial Gradient Filter (NRGF), demonstrating that SiRGraF is faster and more effective, especially for low-SNR images.
