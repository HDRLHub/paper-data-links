## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports in situ observations of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) that contained multiple magnetic flux ropes merging through magnetic reconnection. The study primarily utilizes data from instruments onboard the WIND spacecraft, which recorded both magnetic field and plasma parameters with different time resolutions. Detailed observations covering various time ranges—from the initial identification of the ICME (from early on March 25 to late March 26, 1998) and the flux rope signatures (notably between ~12:00 UT and ~09:50 UT, as well as ~13:30 UT to 09:30 UT) to higher time resolution studies of a current sheet between 16:15 and 16:30 UT on March 25—are presented. Additionally, remote sensing observations from SOHO/LASCO C2 and GOES X-Rays are used to correlate the ICME with a CME and an associated flare on 21 March 1998.
