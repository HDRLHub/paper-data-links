## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates how the frequencies of solar acoustic modes vary with solar activity, revealing that the increase in mode frequencies follows a sigmoid (Gompertz) function rather than a simple linear trend. The study utilizes helioseismic data from three observational instruments—MDI on board SOHO, HMI on board SDO, and the GONG network—covering extensive periods of solar activity cycles. MDI and GONG data span nearly 15 years, while HMI covers a shorter interval during a weaker cycle. Detailed instrument characteristics, such as CCD resolution, sampling cadence, and the specific spectral lines monitored, are provided to underscore how each dataset contributes to the comprehensive analysis of acoustic frequency saturation at high solar activity levels.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - Captures full-disk solar observations with a 1024×1024 pixel CCD.
   - Produces dopplergrams every 60 seconds, essential for helioseismic studies.
   - Data are processed in the Medium-l Program, where images are subsampled (one-fifth resolution) and cropped to 90% of the solar radius.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) has a 1024 × 1024 pixel CCD with a dopplergram obtained every 60 seconds (Scherrer et al. 1995)."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: MDI Observations for Solar Cycle 23
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – April 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "... the data was obtained almost continuously from May 1996 to April 2011."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ni I 6768 Å spectral line
   - **Supporting Quote**: "MDI observed the Ni I 6768 ˚A line."
- **Physical Observable**: Acoustic mode frequencies derived from Doppler shift measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Acoustic mode frequencies obtained by applying spherical harmonic decomposition to HMI, MDI and GONG observations..."
- **Additional Comments**: Mode parameters are extracted using 72-day long time series processed via a global helioseismology pipeline.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - Serves as the advanced successor to MDI with a 4096×4096 pixel CCD.
   - Generates dopplergrams every 45 seconds, observing at a slightly lower atmospheric height compared to MDI.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), designed to succeed MDI, was launched onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in February 2010 (Schou et al. 2012). It has a 4096 × 4096 pixel CCD and observes a dopplergram every 45 seconds. HMI observes the Doppler shift of Fe I 6173 ˚A spectral line..."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: HMI Observations during Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: April 2010 – June 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "I analysed data obtained from April 2010 to June 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173 Å spectral line
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HMI observes the Doppler shift of Fe I 6173 ˚A spectral line..."
- **Physical Observable**: Acoustic mode frequencies measured via Doppler shift observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Acoustic mode frequencies obtained by applying spherical harmonic decomposition to HMI, MDI and GONG observations..."
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data features a slightly higher minimum observed radio flux (74 sfu) and covers solar Cycle 24, a period of relatively weaker solar activity.

### 3. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - Consists of six ground-based instruments distributed globally to ensure continuous helioseismic monitoring.
   - Originally equipped with 256×256 pixel CCDs, which were upgraded to 1024×1024 pixels in 2001.
   - Operates at the same spectral line and sampling cadence as MDI.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), consisting of six instruments around the world, observes the Doppler shift at the same line and at the same sampling time as MDI (Harvey et al. 1996). Its 256 × 256 pixel CCD was replaced by a 1024 × 1024 one in 2001."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: GONG Observations Matching MDI Timeframe
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – April 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For comparison purposes, only GONG data at the same time period as MDI is used."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ni I 6768 Å spectral line
   - **Supporting Quote**: "observes the Doppler shift at the same line and at the same sampling time as MDI."
- **Physical Observable**: Acoustic mode frequencies obtained from 36-day long time series.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The mode parameters for 36-day long time series are provided by the GONG pipeline (Hill et al. 1996)."
- **Additional Comments**: The use of 36-day time series results in twice as many data points compared to MDI’s 72-day series, though the duty cycle varies between 0.67 and 0.96.
