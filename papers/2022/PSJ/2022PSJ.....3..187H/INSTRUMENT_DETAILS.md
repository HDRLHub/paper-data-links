## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the surface properties of near-Sun asteroids, focusing on those with perihelion distances (q) less than or equal to 0.15 AU. The study spans from January 2017 to March 2020 and includes observations of 35 out of 53 known near-Sun asteroids. The research aims to understand the effects of near-Sun processes such as thermal cracking, spin-up, meteoroid impacts, and subsurface volatile release on these asteroids. The study reports optical colors, spectral slopes, and rotation periods for the observed asteroids, and explores potential correlations between these properties and other factors like perihelion distance and Tisserand parameter. The paper also compiles known physical and dynamical properties of these objects.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Monolithic Imager (LMI) on board Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT)
- **General Comments**:
   - The LMI was used for observing northern hemisphere targets. It has a field-of-view (FOV) of 12.3' x 12.3' and a pixel scale of 0.36" after 3x3 binning. SDSS broadband g', r', i', and z' filters were used.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Northern hemisphere targets were primarily observed with Lowell Observatory’s 4.3-m LDT located near Flagstaff, AZ. All observations were made using the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI; Massey et al. 2013). LMI has a field-of-view (FOV) of 12.3' x 12.3' and a pixel scale of 0.36" after an on-chip 3x3 binning. SDSS broadband g', r', i', and z' filters were used."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "SDSS broadband g', r', i', and z' filters were used."
- **Physical Observable**: Optical colors, spectral slopes, rotation periods
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We report the optical colors and spectral slopes of 22 objects that we successfully observed and the measured rotation periods for three objects."
- **Additional Comments**: Observations were made at the asteroid’s ephemeris rate, which frequently resulted in trailed stars.

### Goodman Spectrograph Red Camera on board Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - Used for observing southern hemisphere targets. The camera has a circular FOV of 7.2' diameter and an effective pixel scale of 0.30" after 2x2 binning. SDSS broadband g', r', i', and z' filters were used.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Observations of southern hemisphere targets were made using the 4.1-m SOAR Telescope on Cerro Pachón in Chile. The Goodman Spectrograph Red Camera (Clemens et al. 2004) and the SOAR Optical Imager (SOI) were used. The Goodman Spectrograph camera has a circular FOV of 7.2' diameter. The observations were done in 2x2 binning mode with an effective pixel scale of 0.30"."
