produce the script. We need to construct queries for each instrument mentioned in the context, ensuring that we use the correct time ranges and wavelengths. We will use the `sunpy.net.Fido` module to create these queries. The instruments we need to query are:

1. **SDO/AIA** for the prominence eruption.
2. **STEREO-B/EUVI** for the filament eruption.
3. **SOHO/LASCO** for the jet-like CME.
4. **Fermi/GBM** for the C1.2 class flare.
5. **STEREO-B/SWAVES** for the type III radio burst.

We will create a query for each of these instruments, specifying the time range and wavelengths as provided in the context.
