## Summary of the Paper

- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the importance of CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) radial expansion in enabling slow CMEs (average speeds under 375 km s−1) to drive shocks near 1 AU. The primary data sources are in situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft from 1996 to 2016, focusing on 22 specific slow CMEs identified via cross-referencing the Richardson & Cane (2010) ICME database and the shock list of Kilpua et al. (2015). Detailed analysis is performed using high-cadence (3-second) magnetic field measurements from the Wind MFI instrument and approximately 100-second plasma measurements from the Wind SWE instrument. The paper calculates CME and shock properties, including speeds, expansion, and Mach numbers, over full event intervals associated with identified CME/shock pairs. Study results are directly derived from the analysis of these Wind instrument datasets over the stated period.

## Instrumentation Details

### Magnetic Fields Investigation (MFI) on board Wind

- **General Comments**:
  - The Wind MFI instrument provided high-resolution (3-second) magnetic field data, directly analyzed for identifying CME boundaries, measuring magnetic field features (including maximum field strength), calculating expansion speeds, and shock identification.

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "For each of these CMEs, we visually inspected the Wind 3-second magnetic field measurements from the MFI instrument and the ∼100-second plasma measurements from the SWE instrument. For each CME with a reported speed less or equal to 380 km s−1 from the database of Richardson & Cane (2010), we used these Wind data to calculate the average speed in the magnetic ejecta, the expansion speed, the magnetic ejecta front speed, the maximum speed (including the sheath), and the dimensionless ξ expansion parameter following Démoulin et al. (2008)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Survey of shock-driving slow CMEs, 1996–2016

- **Time Range**: 1996–2016, full CME intervals as specified (22 events, see Table 1 e.g., “1998/08/19 18:40” through “2016/11/09 05:45”)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We identify the slowest CMEs that drove a shock from 1996 to 2016 by combining the ICME database of Richardson & Cane (2010) and the shock database of Kilpua et al. (2015). For each of these CMEs, we visually inspected the Wind 3-second magnetic field measurements from the MFI instrument and the ∼100-second plasma measurements from the SWE instrument."

  - **Supporting Quote**:
    (N/A as MFI is a magnetometer; direct field measurements, not wavelength-specific.)

- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field vector (magnitude and components), identification of magnetic ejecta boundaries, determination of maximum magnetic field strength inside CME ejecta, calculation of expansion and shock properties.

- **Additional Comments**:
  - The data are visualized and interpreted to determine the timing and structure of CME-related shocks, magnetic ejecta boundaries, as well as computation of derived quantities such as expansion speed and the Démoulin et al. expansion parameter (ξ).
  - All main results concerning field strength, ejecta intervals, and magnetic structure are based directly on Wind MFI instrument data.

### Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) on board Wind

- **General Comments**:
  - The Wind SWE instrument supplied plasma measurements (proton density, velocity, temperature) with approximately 100-second resolution, which were directly used to assess CME kinematics (average, front, expansion speeds) and for shock identification.

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "For each of these CMEs, we visually inspected the Wind 3-second magnetic field measurements from the MFI instrument and the ∼100-second plasma measurements from the SWE instrument. For each CME with a reported speed less or equal to 380 km s−1 from the database of Richardson & Cane (2010), we used these Wind data to calculate the average speed in the magnetic ejecta, the expansion speed, the magnetic ejecta front speed, the maximum speed (including the sheath), and the dimensionless ξ expansion parameter following Démoulin et al. (2008)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Survey of shock-driving slow CMEs, 1996–2016

- **Time Range**: 1996–2016, full CME event intervals (see Table 1 for specific events and times, e.g., “08/20 06:00” to “08/21 20:00” for SOL1998-08-19, etc.)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each of these CMEs, we visually inspected the Wind 3-second magnetic field measurements from the MFI instrument and the ∼100-second plasma measurements from the SWE instrument."

- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (plasma parameters)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    (N/A; plasma instrument, not wavelength/detector-based.)

- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind bulk velocity, proton density, temperature; used to calculate CME kinematic parameters (average speed, expansion speed, front speed, maximum speed), identify shocked/sheath regions, and derive Mach numbers.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    "For each CME with a reported speed less or equal to 380 km s−1 from the database of Richardson & Cane (2010), we used these Wind data to calculate the average speed in the magnetic ejecta, the expansion speed, the magnetic ejecta front speed, the maximum speed (including the sheath)..."

- **Additional Comments**:
  - SWE data is essential for assessment of velocity profiles, density and temperature structure used in detailed calculation of expansion and Mach numbers.
  - Derived parameters from SWE (in combination with MFI) underpin all event-specific and statistical results in the study.
