## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This review paper surveys the state-of-the-art in measurement techniques and analysis methods for inferring magnetic fields in the solar photosphere and chromosphere. The research objectives include benchmarking progress in instrumentation and observing capabilities over the last several decades, as well as highlighting recent results that rely directly on advanced polarimetric data. The core findings are based on data from a variety of specific, modern solar instruments, including both ground-based and space-based facilities, with particular reference to developments in high-cadence, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity solar spectropolarimetry. The paper describes the operational details of several observatories and specific instruments whose data underpins key studies cited throughout, especially for periods aligned with notable missions or campaigns, such as the Hinode satellite (from 2006 onward), the SDO/HMI (from 2011 onward), balloon missions like Sunrise/IMaX (notably in June 2009), and ground-based facilities such as GREGOR/GRIS, SST/CRISP, and the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter (FIRS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope. For each, the timeframes, targeted lines and wavelengths, and key physical observables such as magnetic field vector components, are described in their usage context as direct sources for the results and discussion in the present paper.

- **Time Range**: December 1995 – April 2011  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "SoHO/MDI operated from December 1995 to April 2011 and therefore provided coverage of the magnetic field spanning more than one complete solar cycle."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ni I line at 6768 Å, sampled at five wavelengths separated by 75 mÅ (FWHM 94 mÅ)

    "The rotatable waveplates between the interferometers allowed the device to tune over the 0.5 Å bandpass of the Lyot filter centered on the Ni i line at 6768 Å. The full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the combined system was listed at 94 mÅ, and in typical operation SoHO/MDI sampled the line at five wavelengths separated by 75 mÅ."

  "The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), launched in February 2011, carries as one of its complement of instruments the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012). This instrument is so similar in design to the SoHO/MDI that no optical layout of the system is provided herein, but it incorporates a number of features that represent significant upgrades from SoHO/MDI..."

- **Time Range**: February 2011 – at least July 2014 (period of referenced study: "first 3.5 years of the current activity cycle")  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "This study demonstrates a very clear hemispheric preference for sign of the magnetic helicity. The high cadence of SDO/HMI vector magnetic field measurements allowed them to select for study observations of active regions as they traversed the solar central meridian, thereby avoiding any bias that could arise as a result of viewing angle with respect to solar longitude."
