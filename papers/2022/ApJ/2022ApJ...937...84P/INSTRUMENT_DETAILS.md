## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the reconstruction of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) over the last five centuries, particularly during the Maunder minimum. It discusses the variability of TSI on different timescales and the methods used to estimate TSI variations before the availability of direct measurements. The study employs historical observations of magnetic features, cosmogenic isotope measurements, and an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm to separate different temporal components of solar activity. The paper aims to provide insights into the contributions of sunspots, faculae, and quiet Sun magnetic fields to TSI variability and its implications for climate studies.
