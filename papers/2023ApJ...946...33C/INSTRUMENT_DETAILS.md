## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a detailed statistical analysis and time-resolved imaging of solar radio spikes and Type IIIb striae associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). The study utilizes observations from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to analyze over 1000 spikes and 250 individual striae, focusing on their frequency, spatial characteristics, and temporal evolution between 30-70 MHz. The findings suggest that both spikes and striae share similar source characteristics and are influenced by radio-wave scattering, which affects their apparent source sizes and positions. The paper discusses the implications of these observations for understanding electron acceleration and magnetic field dynamics in the solar corona, particularly in the context of CMEs.

## Instrumentation Details

### LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) on board International LOFAR Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - LOFAR was utilized to perform high-resolution observations of solar radio spikes and Type IIIb striae. The instrument's capabilities allowed for detailed imaging and dynamic spectral analysis, providing insights into the sub-second characteristics of these solar radio emissions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of solar radio spikes and Type IIIb striae
- **Time Range**: 2017-July-15, 10:17 UT – 11:39 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Clusters of radio spikes and Type IIIb bursts were observed by the LOw Frequency ARay (LOFAR; van Haarlem et al. 2013) on 2017-July-15 between 10:17 to 11:39 UT, associated with a coronal mass ejection."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 30 – 70 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We present analysis of over 1000 spikes using LOFAR, allowing a much needed statistical determination of the various spike characteristics between 30−45 MHz from imaging observations and 30−70 MHz from dynamic spectra."
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emission characteristics including source size, expansion rate, centroid velocities, and polarization properties.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On average, both burst types have similar source size with fast expansion at millisecond scales. The radio source centroid velocities are often superluminal, and independent of frequency over 30 − 45 MHz."
- **Additional Comments**: The observations were crucial for understanding the dynamics and source characteristics of radio spikes and striae in the context of a CME, highlighting the effects of magnetic field perturbations and electron acceleration processes.
