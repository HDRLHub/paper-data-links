Note: The script assumes that the `NRH`, `AIA`, and `SECCHI` instruments are available in the VSO and that the specified wavelengths are correct for the instruments. Replace `observation_date` with the actual date of the event. The queries are constructed based on the instruments and wavelengths mentioned in the context, and the time range is assumed to cover the entire day of the event. Adjust the time range as needed if more specific times are known.
