# This script, including code comments, was initially drafted by an AI model. Please use with caution.

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for the data collection period
time_range = a.Time('2002-07-23 00:25', '2002-07-23 00:33')

# Define the instrument of interest
instrument = a.Instrument('rhessi')

# Construct the query
query = Fido.search(time_range, instrument)

# Print the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script is designed to query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for data from the RHESSI instrument, specifically for the time range of July 23, 2002, between 00:25 UT and 00:33 UT. The SunPy library's Fido interface is used to perform the search, and the results of the query are printed. The data fetching command is included but commented out, allowing you to fetch the data if needed by uncommenting the line.
