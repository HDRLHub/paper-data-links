# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the origin of sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun, focusing on the acceleration and speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with SGRE events. The study compares the kinematics of CMEs linked to 'Prompt' and 'Delayed' gamma-ray components, finding that those associated with the 'Delayed' component exhibit higher initial accelerations and velocities. The analysis includes data from various instruments and considers the role of halo CMEs (HCMEs) and their association with type II radio bursts and solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The paper utilizes observational data from instruments like Fermi/LAT, STEREO Heliospheric Imagers, and Wind WAVES, among others, to analyze events and support the hypothesis that CME-driven shocks are likely sources of the high-energy protons that lead to SGRE.

## Instrumentation Details

### Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board Fermi Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is crucial for detecting and analyzing gamma-ray emissions from solar flares and associated SGRE events. It provides essential data on the gamma-ray flux and energy spectra, helping to distinguish between 'Prompt' and 'Delayed' emission components.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of SGRE events
- **Time Range**: January 2010 – January 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In the analysis we use the catalog published by Ajello et al. (2021) that contains 45 FLSFs with >30 MeV gamma-ray emission in the period 2010 January–2018 January."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Gamma-rays (>100 MeV and >300 MeV)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The sustained gamma-ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is a prolonged enhancement of >100 MeV gamma-ray emission..."
- **Physical Observable**: Gamma-ray flux and energy spectra
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The >100 MeV SGRE is produced by >300 MeV protons precipitating from the solar corona into the solar chromosphere..."
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument's observations are pivotal in identifying the characteristics of gamma-ray emissions associated with solar flares and distinguishing between different emission phases.

### STEREO Heliospheric Imagers on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Heliospheric Imagers on the STEREO spacecraft provide critical observations of CMEs in white-light, allowing for the analysis of their structure, propagation, and evolution through the heliosphere.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Estimation of CME-driven shock properties
- **Time Range**: Specific observations around 2012 January 23 and March 07 SGRE events
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We estimated the radial distance and speed of the CME-driven shocks at the end time of the 2012 January 23 and March 07 SGRE events using white-light images of STEREO Heliospheric Imagers..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (white-light imaging)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We estimated the radial distance and the space speed of the shock by forward fitting a spheroidal shock model to white-light images of STEREO/HIs..."
- **Physical Observable**: Radial distance and speed of CME-driven shocks
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The shocks were at the radial distances of 0.6–0.8 au and their speeds were high enough (≈975 km s−1 and ≈750 km s−1, respectively) for high-energy particle acceleration."
- **Additional Comments**: These observations are crucial for understanding the spatial extent and impact of CME-driven shocks, particularly in relation to SGRE production.

### Wind WAVES instrument on board Wind spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - Wind WAVES provides radio observations crucial for detecting and analyzing type II radio bursts, which are indicative of shock-driven electron acceleration in the solar atmosphere.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of type II radio bursts associated with CMEs
- **Time Range**: Specific analysis for events like those on 2012 January 23 and March 07
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We estimated the radial distance and speed of the CME-driven shocks at the end time of the 2012 January 23 and March 07 SGRE events...and radio dynamic spectra of Wind WAVES."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Radio wavelengths
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Type II radio bursts are produced by CME-shock accelerated electrons..."
- **Physical Observable**: Frequency and intensity of type II radio emissions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Although type II radio bursts are produced by CME-shock accelerated electrons, they indicate the presence of a strong shock that could also accelerate protons to high energies."
- **Additional Comments**: These data are essential for correlating radio signatures with CME dynamics and assessing the shock strength and its capability for particle acceleration.
