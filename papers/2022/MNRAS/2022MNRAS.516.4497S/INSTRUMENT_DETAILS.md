## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco), which has experienced eleven observed eruptions, with the most recent ones in 2010.1 and 2022.4. The study spans from 2010 to 2022, aiming to measure eclipse times and brightness levels of U Sco during its quiescent phases. The research highlights significant period changes across eruptions, with a notable increase of +22.4¬±1.0 parts-per-million across the 2010.1 eruption. The study also identifies a missed eruption around 2016.78¬±0.10, inferred from a kink in the ùëÇ‚àíùê∂ curve. The paper utilizes data from various instruments and observatories to construct a comprehensive light curve and analyze period changes.
