produce the script. We need to construct queries that specifically target the data collection periods and instruments mentioned in the context of the SEP event on October 9, 2021. The instruments involved are the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board the Solar Orbiter (SolO). Given the detailed information provided, we can define the exact time range and the type of physical observables we are interested in. This will allow us to retrieve the relevant data for further analysis as described in the paper.
