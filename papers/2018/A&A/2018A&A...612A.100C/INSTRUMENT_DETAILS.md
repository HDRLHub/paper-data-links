## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates a well-defined extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave and its association with a CME-driven shock wave observed on 9 March 2012. The primary research objective is to analyze the kinematics of the EUV wave front and the corresponding radio shock source to verify their association. Direct data for analysis were obtained from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on STEREO-Ahead (A), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO-C2/C3) on SOHO, the CALLISTO-SSRT radio spectrometer (part of the e-CALLISTO network) located in Russia, and the WAVES RAD2 instrument on the Wind spacecraft. EUV imaging data were collected around the time of the eruption and wave propagation (roughly 03:40–04:00 UT on 2012-03-09), while radio spectrograph data provided further evidence of shock propagation in both coronal and interplanetary regions. The data collected from these instruments is central to the findings: the identification and measurement of two EUV wave speeds, the timing and characteristics of an associated type II radio burst, and the calculation of shock speed and coronal/interplanetary parameters.

### EUVI on board STEREO-Ahead (A)
- **General Comments**:
  - EUVI-A provided limb EUV observations of the propagating wave dome in the corona, critical for triangulating wave heights and speeds, and for direct comparison with SDO/AIA disk observations to trace the full three-dimensional EUV wave evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this article, we present an interesting case study of an EUV wave observed by STEREO/EUVI-A and SDO/AIA, associated with a shock wave driven by a halo CME observed by SOHO/LASCO-C2/C3, in which the propagation of the shock wave through both the corona and the interplanetary medium was evidenced by the observations of type II bursts."
