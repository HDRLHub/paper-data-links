## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a moving type-IV (t–IVm) solar radio burst observed during a solar eruption associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). By combining multi-wavelength data—from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light (WL) imaging to radio spectral and imaging observations—the study tracks the evolution of an eruptive structure from the inner to the outer corona. Key observations include the association of the t–IVm sources with a hot, twisted EUV structure (imaged primarily by AIA/SDO) and with the bright core of the CME (observed in WL by LASCO). Radio instruments such as ORFEES, NDA, and the Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) provide the dynamic spectrum and imaging of the radio burst across frequencies from ~300 MHz down to ~10 MHz, along with measurements of brightness temperature, polarization, and source motion. Additional observations from SWAP/PROBA2, STEREO (EUVI and COR1/2), and GOES soft X-ray (SXR) further contextualize the eruption timing and thermal properties of the source plasmas.

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides high-resolution multi-wavelength EUV images of the solar corona and is used to capture both hot and cool plasma emissions. In this study, it is used to observe the eruptive structure (labeled S1) associated with the t–IVm burst, revealing the evolution of hot channels (131 Å and 94 Å) and cool channels (171 Å and 304 Å).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “According to the AIA data at 131 and 94 ˚A (hot channels, note the 131 ˚A channel also responds at low temperature) and (171 and 304 ˚A, cool channels), the eruption can be separated into two stages...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Early Eruptive Phase**
   - **Time Range**: Observations commencing from approximately 11:20 UT (flare onset) until about 12:25 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “A highly-inclined and twisted/writhed structure (referred to as S1, see the green arrow in Figure 2(a)) is released with the ﬂare around 11:20 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å, 94 Å, 171 Å, and 304 Å.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “AIA images of the event at 131 (a and d), 171 (b and e), and 304 (c and f) ˚A...”
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity revealing plasma temperature (up to several MK) and morphological evolution of eruptive structures.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “It is observable at 131 and 94 ˚A and invisible at 171 and 304 ˚A, indicating that it contains plasmas as hot as 6−10 MK.”
   - **Additional Comments**: The AIA data also support the DEM analysis later used to infer plasma density and temperature of the eruptive structure.

- **Data Collection Period 2: Later Eruptive Phase and Interaction**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately 12:25 UT to 13:04 UT.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “After 12:25 UT, S1 starts to take off at a faster pace. This starts the second stage.” And “An animation of the AIA images is available. The animation runs from 11:20 to 13:04 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: The same four channels as above (131 Å, 94 Å, 171 Å, 304 Å).
   - **Physical Observable**: Evolution of eruptive features including the appearance of a narrow knot-like loop structure (L1) and the dynamics of filament systems (F1 and F2), as well as evidence for magnetic reconnection.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “At 171 ˚A, a narrow knot−like loop structure (referred to as L1, see the red arrow in Figure 2(e)) appears after 12:32 UT.”
   - **Additional Comments**: These observations are crucial for linking the eruptive structure with the radio sources and for assessing the temperature and density through differential emission measure (DEM) analysis.

### 2. Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System Detector and Image Processing (SWAP) on board PROBA2
- **General Comments**:
   - SWAP provides EUV imaging at a single passband of 171 Å and shows signatures similar to those seen by AIA. Although SWAP data are mentioned, they were not used in the detailed analysis due to the single passband availability.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME was also observed by several instruments along the Sun-Earth line, including the AIA/SDO, SWAP/PROBA2, and LASCO/SOHO. For this event, the SWAP data reveal signatures similar to the AIA data, yet with only one passband at 171 ˚A, and therefore are not used in this study.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated; assumed to be concurrent with the AIA observations during the eruption.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å.
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity capturing coronal structures.
   - **Additional Comments**: SWAP’s contribution confirms the EUV observations from multiple platforms.

### 3. Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO C2 observes white-light (WL) coronagraph images of the outer corona. It is used here to follow the CME evolution, particularly to match the extrapolated t–IVm radio source locations with the CME’s bright core.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In Figure 7(a) we show one composite image of the last 150 MHz source and the C2 data at 13:12 UT.”

      - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME presents a double-front morphology, with the external front likely given by the material piled-up...”
   - **Additional Comments**: LASCO complements the EUV and radio observations by filling the imaging gap in the outer corona.

### 4. STEREO Instruments on board the twin STEREO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The STEREO spacecraft provide both EUV and white-light coronagraph observations from different viewing perspectives. STEREO EUVI captures EUV images (notably at 195 Å) while COR1/2 provide white-light coronagraph imaging.
