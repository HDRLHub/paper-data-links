## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the diffuse far-ultraviolet (FUV) background, focusing on its components and potential sources. The study aims to explain the FUV background observed at high Galactic latitudes, which includes contributions from stellar FUV reflected by dust grains (Diffuse Galactic Light or DGL), FUV from other galaxies and the intergalactic medium (Extragalactic Background Light or EBL), and an unexplained component referred to as the "offset" component. The paper explores conventional sources of FUV photons, such as line emission from the Galactic Hot Ionized Medium (HIM), two-photon emission from the Galactic Warm Ionized Medium (WIM), low-velocity shocks, and Lyman-β fluorescence of hydrogen in the Solar System. The study concludes that a significant portion of the offset component can be explained by these conventional sources.
