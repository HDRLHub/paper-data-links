## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the application of deep learning techniques to enhance the resolution and calibrate solar magnetograms across different instrumental generations. The primary instruments involved are the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The study leverages deep learning to superresolve (SR) and cross-calibrate low-resolution (LR) images from MDI and GONG to match the higher resolution of HMI. The research demonstrates that deep learning can effectively increase the resolution and accuracy of solar magnetic field images, which is crucial for improving the understanding and prediction of solar phenomena and space weather events.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI is a space-based solar observatory instrument used for capturing solar magnetograms. It is the predecessor of the HMI and offers lower resolution, cadence, and sensitivity compared to HMI.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping observation period with HMI for deep learning training
- **Time Range**: April 2010 – April 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: MDI data was used as a source instrument for training the superresolution architecture. The data from this period was used to create magnetogram pairs with HMI for deep learning training.

### Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) on board National Solar Observatory (NSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG is a ground-based network of six solar observing stations around the world. It provides data for solar oscillation and magnetic field studies. It offers lower resolution compared to HMI.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping observation period with HMI for deep learning training
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2019 (only even years used: 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: GONG data was used as a source instrument for training the superresolution architecture. The data from these periods was used to create magnetogram pairs with HMI for deep learning training.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is the last generation, space-based instrument designed to study the solar magnetic field and solar oscillations. It provides high-resolution magnetograms and is used as the target instrument for the superresolution study.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Target instrument for superresolution
- **Time Range**: Continuous operation since its launch, specific focus on overlapping periods with MDI and GONG for this study (2010–2011 for MDI, 2010–2019 for GONG)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data served as the high-resolution target for training the deep learning models to superresolve and calibrate the lower resolution images from MDI and GONG.
