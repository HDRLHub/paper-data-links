produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode and the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) based on the specific details provided in the context.

1. **Identify the Instruments and Time Ranges**:
   - For EIS on Hinode, the time range is from 2007 November 16, 07:26 UT to 08:01 UT.
   - For SUMER on SOHO, the time range is from 2007 November 16, 09:01 UT to 10:03 UT.

2. **Determine the Wavelengths**:
   - EIS observes in two bands: 170 to 210 Å (SW) and 245 to 290 Å (LW).
   - SUMER observes in four bands: 672–717 Å, 746–791 Å, 1015–1060 Å, and 1210–1255 Å.

3. **Physical Observables**:
   - Both instruments are used to measure ion temperatures and their dependence on the ion charge-to-mass ratio (Z/A).

4. **Construct the Queries**:
   - Use the `sunpy.net.Fido` interface to search for data from these instruments within the specified time ranges and wavelengths.
