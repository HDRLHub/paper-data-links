## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the variability of helium abundance (ùê¥ùêªùëí) in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and its correlation with solar activity, chromospheric evaporation, and gravitational settling. The study analyzes 275 ICME events and examines the role of solar flares and other processes in enhancing ùê¥ùêªùëí beyond the typical 8% found in the solar photosphere. The data sources include the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on board the ACE satellite and the OMNI dataset, covering observations from 04 February 1988 to 21 August 2011.

## Instrumentation Details

### Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on board ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SWICS instrument on the ACE satellite was used to measure elemental compositions and charge states of solar wind ions. The data from this instrument was crucial for analyzing the helium abundance in ICMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The measurements from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) (Gloeckler et al. 1998) instrument onboard ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) satellite is used in the present study."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General ICME observations
- **Time Range**: 04 February 1988 ‚Äì 21 August 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "This data set contains data from 04 February 1988 to 21 August 2011 for several elements and their charge states."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (instrument measures ion compositions and charge states)
- **Physical Observable**: Elemental compositions and charge states of solar wind ions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We have used the two-hourly data of different elemental compositions and charge states here."
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument entered a different state due to hardware degradation on 22 August 2011, after which a modified approach was used to obtain compositional data.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Post-hardware degradation observations
- **Time Range**: 22 August 2011 ‚Äì unspecified end date
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On 22 August 2011, ACE/ SWICS entered into a different state due to hardware degradation caused by radiation-induced defects. After this incident, another approach (Shearer et al. 2014) was used to get the compositional data."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (instrument measures ion compositions and charge states)
- **Physical Observable**: Elemental compositions and charge states of solar wind ions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A few compositional observations were possible using this indirect and modified approach."
- **Additional Comments**: Details on the data prior to and after the change in approach can be found at the ACE Science Center website.

### OMNI Dataset
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI dataset provides one-hourly helium and hydrogen ratios, which were used to support the analysis of helium abundance in ICMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The one hourly helium and hydrogen ratios are also used from the OMNI dataset (King & Papitashvili 2005)."

#### Data Collection Period: General ICME observations
- **Time Range**: Not specified
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The one hourly helium and hydrogen ratios are also used from the OMNI dataset (King & Papitashvili 2005)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (dataset provides ratios of helium and hydrogen)
- **Physical Observable**: Helium and hydrogen ratios
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The one hourly helium and hydrogen ratios are also used from the OMNI dataset (King & Papitashvili 2005)."
- **Additional Comments**: The dataset is integrated and cross-calibrated, providing a comprehensive view of solar wind parameters.
