1. TRACE on board the TRACE spacecraft  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - TRACE was an EUV imager that operated from 1998 to 2010 and provided high-resolution images over an 8.5 arcminute field of view with a spatial resolution of 1 arcsecond. In this study, it was used to image the evolving solar jet in the 195 Å passband, which is sensitive to Fe XII and Fe XXIV emissions (with peak temperature sensitivities at log[T(MK)] = 6.2 and 7.2, respectively).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - "On 2002 August 19, TRACE observed a solar jet associated with a ﬂare from active region 10069... with coverage in the 195˚A ﬁlter at approximately 23 second cadence during the impulsive part of the event."
