## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the origins and characteristics of ortho‐gardenhose (OGH) heliospheric magnetic flux that do not conform to the classic Parker spiral theory. The study uses in‐situ measurements of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) from multiple spacecraft over several decades. Near‐Earth measurements from the Wind and ACE spacecraft (spanning 1995–2017) and inner heliospheric data from the Helios‐1 and Helios‐2 missions (spanning December 1974 to August 1981) are analyzed to determine how OGH flux develops with heliocentric distance and varies in both temporal and spatial scales. The paper also extrapolates trends towards the smaller heliocentric distances to be explored by the Parker Solar Probe, utilizing remote sensing data from SOHO/LASCO C3 for comparison. These diverse datasets, featuring different temporal resolutions and instrument characteristics, allow the authors to assess both the large‐scale structure (via hour-to-day averaging) and small‐scale fluctuations (down to 16‐second resolution) of the interplanetary magnetic field.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. WIND Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The WIND spacecraft provided near-Earth heliospheric magnetic field measurements included in the dataset. Its observations, in conjunction with those from ACE, establish the long-term (1995–2017) context for OGH studies at 1 AU.

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...observations of the HMF for the years 1996–2017 (inclusive)...”
- **Additional Comments**: These near-continuous measurements contribute to the analysis of the angular distributions (gardenhose angles) and flux cancellation effects over varying averaging timescales.

### 2. ACE Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The ACE spacecraft supplied high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements near Earth. Two datasets are used: a 1-minute resolution dataset that forms part of the Omni composite covering 1995–2017, and a high-resolution 16-second dataset from the ACE magnetometer spanning from 1998 to September 2018.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We extend some studies in resolution down to 16s using 39446983 16-second samples from the ACE magnetometer (Smith et al, 1998) taken between 1998 and September 2018...”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Omni Composite (ACE + WIND) – 1-Minute Resolution
- **Time Range**: January 1, 1995 – December 31, 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...using the Omni composite of data at 1-minute resolution (made available by the Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF)... for 1995–2017...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in-situ magnetic field measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: In-situ heliospheric magnetic field (BX, BY components)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...the HMF for the years 1996–2017 (inclusive)...”
- **Additional Comments**: These data provide nearly continuous coverage (97.87% availability) and serve as the primary dataset for studying the effect of the averaging timescale on observed magnetic field structures.

#### Data Collection Period 2: ACE Magnetometer – 16-Second Resolution
- **Time Range**: 1998 – September 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...using 39446983 16-second samples from the ACE magnetometer (Smith et al, 1998) taken between 1998 and September 2018 (an availability of 99.86%).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (measures magnetic field directly)
- **Physical Observable**: High-resolution heliospheric magnetic field fluctuations, enabling studies on very short temporal scales (down to 16 seconds).
- **Additional Comments**: These high-resolution measurements reveal the small-scale temporal structure of the OGH flux and help in determining the spectrum of spatial/temporal scale sizes.

### 3. Helios-1 and Helios-2 Spacecraft (on board Plasma Experiments and Magnetometers)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helios missions provided in-situ HMF measurements closer to the Sun (between 0.29 AU and 1 AU). Two complementary instruments onboard were used: plasma experiments for solar wind flow data and magnetometers for HMF measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...by the Helios-1 and -2 spacecraft at 0.29 AU < r ≤ 1 AU (for December 1974 to August 1981)...”  
   - “...solar wind flow data from the plasma experiments (Rosenbauer et al., 1977) and HMF observations from the magnetometers (Neubauer et al., 1977) on board both craft.”
   
#### Data Collection Period: Helios-1
- **Time Range**: December 1974 – June 1981
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...Helios 1 (which made 13 orbits between December 1974 and June 1981...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in-situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind flow velocities (plasma experiments) and heliospheric magnetic field components (BX, BY) from onboard magnetometers.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...HMF observations from the magnetometers (Neubauer et al., 1977)...”
- **Additional Comments**: Data from Helios-1 were processed from approximately 40-second resolution and interpolated to 1-minute samples for consistency. The Helios data provide insight into the development of OGH flux at distances closer to the Sun.

#### Data Collection Period: Helios-2
- **Time Range**: January 1976 – May 1979
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...Helios 2 (which made 7 orbits between January 1976 and May 1979...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in-situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind plasma parameters (via plasma experiments) and magnetic field components (via magnetometers).
- **Additional Comments**: Like Helios-1, Helios-2’s data are used to analyze the angular distributions of the HMF in the inner heliosphere and to compare with near-Earth (1 AU) observations.

### 4. SOHO/LASCO C3 Instrument
- **General Comments**:
   - While the primary focus of the paper is on in-situ magnetic field measurements, remote sensing observations from the SOHO/LASCO C3 coronagraph are used to derive the solar wind velocity profile at heliocentric distances closer to the Sun (specifically at 6R⊙ and 26R⊙). These observations support the modeling of the Parker spiral variation with r.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...values at r of 6R and 26R (open circles) derived by applying Fourier motion filters to SOHO/LASCO C3 movies observed from 1999 to 2010 by Cho et al. (2018).”
   
#### Data Collection Period: SOHO/LASCO C3
- **Time Range**: 1999 – 2010
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...SOHO/LASCO C3 movies observed from 1999 to 2010 by Cho et al. (2018).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated; the LASCO C3 coronagraph operates in white light (broadband visible wavelengths) to image the solar corona.
- **Physical Observable**: Remote sensing images of the solar corona for identifying fast solar wind regions and measuring solar wind speed via Fourier motion filtering.
- **Additional Comments**: This instrument provides complementary information necessary for modeling the radial solar wind velocity profile, which is used in the Parker spiral computations to estimate the gardenhose angle as a function of heliocentric distance.
