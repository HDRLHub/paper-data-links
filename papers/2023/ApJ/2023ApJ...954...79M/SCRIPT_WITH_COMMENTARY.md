This script is designed to query the VSO for data from the Fermi/LAT, STEREO Heliospheric Imagers, and Wind WAVES instruments based on the specific requirements outlined in the context. Each query is tailored to the time ranges and types of observations relevant to the study of SGRE events and CMEs. The results of these queries are printed, and the data can be downloaded by uncommenting the appropriate lines. This approach ensures that the script is directly aligned with the research objectives and uses the correct parameters for each instrument.
