## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates and compares the magnetic helicity of a magnetic cloud observed as an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) at Earth (1 AU) on 17–18 March 2013 with its solar source CME, which erupted on 15 March 2013 from NOAA active region 11692. The researchers derive reconnection flux using post-eruption arcade (PEA) methods based on photospheric magnetograms, forward-model the geometry of the CME with white-light coronagraph data, and analyze in situ solar wind and magnetic field signatures at Earth using spacecraft observations. Specific dates of data collection span from 15 March 2013 (solar eruption) through 17–18 March 2013 (in situ arrival at Earth). The results depend directly on detailed measurements from specialized solar and heliospheric instruments, with data analyzed for precise magnetic and plasma parameters vital to their helicity calculations.
