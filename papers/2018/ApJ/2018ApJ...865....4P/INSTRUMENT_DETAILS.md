## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the dependence of coronal mass ejection (CME) properties on the magnetic characteristics of their solar source active regions and on the reconnection flux associated with eruptive flares. The analysis uses a comprehensive database of CMEs from solar cycle 24 (approximately 2010–2014) and correlates the deprojected geometric and kinematic properties obtained via multi-view white‐light coronagraph images with the source active region’s vector magnetic properties. The study relies on various observational instruments—each providing key measurements such as white‐light imaging of CMEs, extreme ultraviolet imaging for identifying post-eruption arcades, and vector magnetograms for calculating magnetic flux and related parameters. These datasets, covering specific time ranges tied to the operational periods of instruments onboard STEREO, SOHO, and SDO, are essential to constrain empirical relationships between the magnetic reconnection flux and CME speeds.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SECCHI Coronagraph (COR2) on board STEREO A & B
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI/COR2 instruments provide white‐light synoptic images used to track the flux‐rope morphology of CMEs.
   - They enable the application of the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) forward modeling technique by offering observations from two different vantage points.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The coronagraphs of the Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI, Howard et al. 2008a) aboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecrafts A & B provide simultaneous observations of CMEs from two diﬀerent viewpoints in space.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Cycle 24 Observations
- **Time Range**: From the start of the SDO mission in May 2010 until data from both STEREO spacecraft became available (covering the period approximately 2010–2014).
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...observed in each data frame of white-light synoptic movies provided by SECCHI/COR2 A & B during solar cycle 24 (between the start of SDO mission in May 2010 and until data from both STEREO spacecrafts are available).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light) imaging is used.
