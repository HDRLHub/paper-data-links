produce the script. We need to construct a query to download data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) using the SunPy library. The context provided focuses on various instruments used to measure different physical observables in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) ranges. However, the VSO interface provided only includes data from the SOHO mission. We will focus on the SWAN instrument on board SOHO, which measures LyÎ± emissions, as it is relevant to the context provided.
