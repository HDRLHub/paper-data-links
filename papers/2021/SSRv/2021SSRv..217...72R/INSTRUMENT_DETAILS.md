1. Nuclear Emulsion Detector on a Sounding‐Rocket  
   - General Comments:  
     This instrument consisted of a nuclear emulsion payload carried above the Earth’s atmosphere on a Nike‐Cajun sounding rocket. It was used to record tracks of energetic ions during an SEP event, thereby measuring the element abundances (including ions of C, N, O and others) for the first time in such events.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Their Nike-Cajun sounding rocket flight from Ft. Churchill, Manitoba exposed a nuclear emulsion payload above the atmosphere for several minutes during the SEP event of 3 September, 1960.”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • During the SEP event on 3 September 1960 (recording lasted for “several minutes” during that event).
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • The detector was based on nuclear emulsions sensitive to charged-particle tracks rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.  
     • The observable was the count of ion tracks (δ-ray counts along tracks) which indicated the elemental composition at energies above approximately 40 MeV amu⁻¹.

2. dE/dx vs. E Telescopes with Solid-State Detectors on Satellites  
   - General Comments:  
     These instruments incorporated telescopes that measured the energy loss rate (dE/dx) versus the total energy (E) of particles. They used higher-resolution, often silicon-based, solid-state detectors and represented a significant improvement over earlier techniques.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The next decade saw the flight of dE/dx vs. E telescopes using higher-resolution detectors on satellites. … Panel (c) shows resolution of Si, solid-state detectors with data accumulation during 43 large SEP events from 1978 – 1988 …”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • Integrated over the period 1978 – 1988 (as part of studies over 43 large SEP events).  
     • Initiated in the early 1970’s with continued advances thereafter.
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Detectors: Silicon solid-state detectors recording energy loss (dE/dx) and total energy (E).  
     • Observables: Ion energy spectra and elemental identification via characteristic energy-loss signatures.

3. Apollo 16 Command Module Window – Etch-Pit Analysis  
   - General Comments:  
     In a novel approach, the glass window of the Apollo 16 command module was used as an impromptu detector. Etch-pit analysis of this window provided evidence of heavy ions from solar energetic particle events.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Abundances of elements significantly above Fe … were first reported in an early measurement by Shirk and Price (1974) who studied etch pits in the glass window of the Apollo 16 command module from the small SEP event of 18 April 1972.”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • The SEP event of 18 April 1972.
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Detector: The glass window acting as a passive nuclear track detector (recording etch pits).  
     • Observable: The density and distribution of etch pits, which were interpreted in terms of the elemental composition of the incident SEP flux.

4. Particle Detectors on the Wind Spacecraft  
   - General Comments:  
     Instruments on the Wind spacecraft provided measurements of elemental abundances in SEP events. They were capable of detecting enhancements in ion groups (e.g. (50 ≤ Z ≤ 56)/Fe) and contributed to studies distinguishing impulsive events.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Years later, using data from the Wind spacecraft for a five-year period Reames (2000) found many impulsive events with enhancements in (50 ≤ Z ≤ 56)/Fe …”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • A five-year period (exact calendar dates are not specified in the context, but the study was published around 2000, suggesting data likely from the early to mid-1990’s).
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Detectors: Particle telescopes capable of measuring the energy and charge of ions.  
     • Observables: Elemental composition, especially of heavy ions, and their relative enhancements in impulsive SEP events.

5. Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Imagers of Solar Jets  
   - General Comments:  
     EUV imaging instruments are used to study the temperatures and structures in the solar corona. In this context, they have been applied to determine the source plasma temperatures in regions (solar jets) associated with ³He-rich SEP events.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Good agreement with these source temperatures has recently been found for values of 2 – 2.5 MK, obtained using the differential-emission-measure technique for determining temperatures from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of coronal source regions of 24 solar jets associated with ³He-rich events (Bučík et al. 2021).”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • Observations referenced in Bučík et al. (2021), implying modern EUV spacecraft data (e.g. from SDO/AIA or similar instruments) during recent solar cycles.
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Wavelengths: Extreme ultraviolet wavelengths emitted by coronal plasma.  
     • Observables: Differential emission measures used to infer plasma temperatures, particularly to confirm the ~2 – 2.5 MK source temperature in the jets.

6. X-ray Detectors/Imagers for Observing Solar Flares and Flare Loops  
   - General Comments:  
     X-ray instrumentation monitors high-temperature plasma in closed magnetic-loop regions (solar flares). In the context of SEP studies, these detectors help identify regions where accelerated particles deposit energy and produce X-ray bremsstrahlung.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “... while nearby closed loops at ~10 MK emit X-rays simultaneously. … as these loops close they capture SEPs which deposit their energy as heat (10 MK) or the electrons emit X-ray Bremstrahlung as they scatter against ions in the denser plasma.”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • The observations are tied to solar flare events accompanying or following the SEP acceleration episodes. Specific dates are not provided in the context.
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Wavelengths: X-ray wavelengths corresponding to plasma at temperatures around 10 MK.  
     • Observables: X-ray spectral and imaging data used to diagnose flare plasma properties and the deposition of energy by accelerated particles.

7. Radio Detectors for Type III Burst Observations  
   - General Comments:  
     Instruments that monitor radio emissions detect type III radio bursts which are produced by beams of energetic electrons escaping along open magnetic field lines. The detection of these bursts has been a key signature used to associate impulsive SEP events with solar jets.
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Impulsive SEP events had been shown to be accompanied by the intense beams of electrons (Reames et al. 1985) that produce type III radio bursts (Reames and Stone 1986).”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • These observations occur simultaneously with impulsive SEP events; while specific dates are not provided in the context, type III burst observations have been recorded continuously since the early days of radio astronomy and during all relevant SEP events.
   - Wavelengths/Detectors/Physical Observables:  
     • Detectors: Radio spectrographs/antennae tuned to measure solar radio emissions in the metric to decametric wavelength range.  
     • Observables: Frequency-time dynamic spectra showing type III bursts that indicate the presence of streaming electrons.
