## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study examines the eruption of a quiescent solar prominence on 17 August 2013 and the resulting non-flare-related coronal mass ejection (CME). The research utilizes direct observational data from multiple instruments, including SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly), STEREO-B/EUVI (Extreme UltraViolet Imager), SOHO/LASCO (Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph), the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP), the USAF Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), and the Ussuriysk Observatory Radiometer (RT-2). Observations span from late 16 August through 17 August 2013, covering the eruption onset, prominence evolution, microwave negative burst characterization, and CME propagation up to distances exceeding 20 R⊙. Data periods, wavelengths, and physical observables (such as microwave emission, EUV imagery at 304 Å, and white-light coronagraphy) are leveraged for kinematic, structural, and mass analysis directly fundamental to the paper's conclusions.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used to observe the eruption and evolution of the quiescent prominence in the He II 304 Å channel with high imaging cadence; provided measurements of prominence area and morphological changes critical for parameter estimation and comparison with radio absorption modeling.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The SDO/AIA level 1.5 quarter-resolution data with an interval of two to four minutes were taken from jsoc.stanford.edu/data/aia/synoptic/."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence eruption and area measurements
- **Time Range**: 2013-08-16 22:50 UT – 2013-08-17 03:00 UT (eruption start at ~22:50 Aug 16, area and height measurements through 01:30–02:00 Aug 17)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The eruption of a large quiescent prominence was observed by SDO/AIA in 304 ˚A starting at about 22:50 on 16 August 2013 (all times hereafter refer to UTC). ... The rising prominence was visible until, at least, 02:00 on 17 August, and its south leg is detectable after 03:00."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å (He II, EUV)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The sets of EUV and white-light images available make it possible to follow the appearance of the CME near the Sun and its expansion up to distances exceeding 20 R⊙. ... The current observational opportunities are considerably broadened due to the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et  al., 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)."
- **Physical Observable**: Projected area of the prominence on the solar disk and above the limb, morphology changes, eruption timing, and comparative brightness (absorption and emission)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The AIA 304 ˚A image ratios in Figure 1 present the prominence, which was located in the North-East quadrant of the Sun away from activity complexes. The prominence appears dark on the solar disk because of absorption of the background solar emission in its material. ... Expansion of the rising prominence is manifested in large dark patches moving on the solar disk, while the prominence is bright above the limb."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Area measurements restricted within the solar radio disk up to 1.186 R⊙ for cross-comparison with microwave absorption modeling.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "To get comparable estimates, we limited the area of the prominence in the 304 ˚A images by a disk with a radius of 1.186 R⊙ corresponding to the solar radio radius at the lowest frequency of 1 GHz, at which the negative burst was observed."

### Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided a secondary vantage point (STEREO-B, 138° behind Earth) for imaging the erupting prominence, particularly above the limb, allowing 3D mass, height, and geometric property estimation; supplied high-cadence 304 Å data crucial for height measurements and evolution mapping.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The STEREO/EUVI images with a ten-minute interval are available at sharpp.nrl.navy.mil/cgi-bin/swdbi/secchi ﬂight/img short/form. ... The erupting prominence was also observed from STEREO-B spacecraft located 138◦behind the Earth..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence height and morphological structure
- **Time Range**: 2013-08-16 ~22:50 UT – 2013-08-17 03:00 UT (overlapping and extending SDO/AIA period, used for prominence above-the-limb tracking and kinematics)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The rising prominence was visible until, at least, 02:00 on 17 August, and its south leg is detectable after 03:00. ... The movie reveals a complex threadlike structure of the prominence, its untwisting, and draining cool plasma from its body."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å (He II, EUV)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The 20130817 EUVI304.mpg movie in the supplementary material presents the prominence eruption observed by STEREO-B/EUVI in 304 ˚A."
- **Physical Observable**: Height of the prominence above the limb, three-dimensional geometry, mass estimation via radial width measurement
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The height was directly measured from the images produced from the STEREO-B vantage point, but its measurements from the SDO/AIA images are not straightforward. ... We measured for each time its width in the radial direction (Figure 6a). The mass was estimated as m = mpneAL with mp being the proton mass."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The prominence structure and its movement (untwisting, draining, stretching) are more discernible off-limb due to favorable STEREO-B geometry.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The contrast of the images was enhanced by dividing them by an azimuthally-averaged radial background distribution. ... The movie reveals a complex threadlike structure of the prominence, its untwisting, and draining cool plasma from its body."

### Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 and C3 on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided formal CME detection and multi-stage tracking in white-light, from its first coronal appearance through far-reaching propagation (>20 solar radii), supplying critical mass, kinematics, and structural differentiation between CME components (core, cavity, leading front).
- **Supporting Quote**: "The images produced by the C2 and C3 LASCO coronagraphs with an interval of 12 minutes were taken from sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/archive.html."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME tracking in white light coronagraphy
- **Time Range**: 2013-08-17 01:26 UT – 2013-08-17 ~15:00 UT (white-light CME detected at 01:26; tracking extended as image cadence/visibility allowed)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "According to the LASCO CME catalog, starting from 01:26, SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs observed a weakly accelerating CME with a central position angle of 42◦, which corresponds to the orientation of the erupting prominence."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White Light (visible range; not spectral-line imaging)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The lists and movies of CMEs as well as their parameters measured from the images produced by the Large Angle and Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO: Brueckner et al., 1995) onboard SOHO are available in the online CME catalog..."
- **Physical Observable**: CME front, cavity, bright core location/kinematics, mass estimates, morphological evolution
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME had an estimated mass of 3.6 × 1015 g, average speed of 369 km s−1, and average acceleration of 5.1 m s−2. ... The CME had a classical three-part structure with a faint frontal structure (FS), cavity behind it, and a bright core in the bottom part of the CME. The core corresponded to the erupting prominence."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Kinematic and acceleration profiles for different structural components were measured by fitting analytic functions to manual distance-time measurements in the images.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For the measurements we used running diﬀerences produced from the images observed by the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on STEREO-B and by the LASCO-C2 and -C3 coronagraphs on SOHO."

### Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI), COR1, and COR2 on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
  - EUVI provided EUV data for off-limb prominence tracking as already described above. COR1 and COR2 are white-light coronagraphs used for CME core and front analysis from a different vantage (STEREO-B), enabling 3D kinematic fitting and evolution studies beyond the FOV of EUVI and for cross-calibration with LASCO observations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We also used the images produced by the STEREO-B coronagraphs: COR1 with intervals of ﬁve to ten minutes and COR2 with intervals of 15 – 30 minutes..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME evolution and structural changes
- **Time Range**: 2013-08-17 01:30 UT – 2013-08-17 ~11:00 UT (period during which CME components—core, front, loops—were tracked in coronagraph images)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME is visible in the 20130817 cor1 orig.mpg movie composed from the STEREO-B/COR1 images in the polarized brightness, which reveal CMEs without subtraction."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White Light (COR1 and COR2, polarized brightness)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME is visible in the 20130817 cor1 orig.mpg movie composed from the STEREO-B/COR1 images in the polarized brightness, which reveal CMEs without subtraction."
- **Physical Observable**: CME 3-part structure (front, cavity, core) with emphasis on internal structure formation, accelerations, dynamic transformations, and morphological connectivity to prominence evolution
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The running-diﬀerence movies and Figure 6 reveal more details in the CME structure. A loop-like thick middle structure... was measured up to the largest distances. The lowest north segment of the core... was observed by COR1 and COR2 but not by LASCO. The prominence visible in 304 ˚A (blue arcs and contour in Figures 6a and 6b) was close to this segment."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Manual tracking, cross-fitted with LASCO time series for vantage correction; structural changes within the evolving CME cavity detailed using this dataset.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We measured the initial rise of the prominence and early CME expansion from STEREO-B images, where they are better visible, and adjusted the scaling factor and oﬀset for the measurements from SOHO data to match the results obtained from STEREO-B data."

### Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP)
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided multi-frequency total flux microwave time profiles; essential for detection and quantification of the negative burst, estimation of absorption parameters, and prominence plasma modeling.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "We used microwave total-ﬂux data recorded by the Nobeyama Radio Polarime- ters (NoRP: Torii et al., 1979; Nakajima et al., 1985; ftp://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/pub/norp/xdr/)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Microwave negative burst analysis
- **Time Range**: 2013-08-16 23:40 UT – 2013-08-17 02:00 UT (negative burst observed to start at 23:40 Aug 16, max depth ~01:00 Aug 17)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "At all frequencies, except for 2.7 GHz, the total ﬂux started decreasing below a quasi-stationary level at about 23:40 on 16 August. The maximum depth reached ≈6.5 % of the quiet-Sun level at 01:00 on 17 August in a range of 2 – 3.75 GHz, and then a gradual recovery started."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1 GHz, 2 GHz, 3.75 GHz, 5 GHz, 9.4 GHz (exact frequencies as used in data analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 2 presents total ﬂux time-proﬁles of radio emission at diﬀerent frequencies normalized to the corresponding levels of the quiet-Sun emission [FQS]. The pre-burst level [F0] at each frequency is subtracted."
- **Physical Observable**: Temporal profile (depth and recovery) of solar microwave flux depression (negative burst) at multiple frequencies
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Unlike a typical situation, the negative burst was “isolated”, not being preceded by the usual ﬂare-related impulsive burst. At all frequencies, except for 2.7 GHz, the total ﬂux started decreasing below a quasi-stationary level at about 23:40 on 16 August."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - NoRP data at specific frequencies (e.g., "The NoRP data at 2 and 3.75 GHz with considerable variations were ﬁtted with a polynomial...") used for model inversion to extract prominence parameters.
