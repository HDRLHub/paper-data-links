This script uses SunPyâ€™s VSO client to query SDO/AIA data corresponding to the flare onset
observations described in the paper. The query is for SDO/AIA observations around the time
of the 2017 September 10 event where the flare onset occurred shortly after 15:40 UT.
We have chosen a query time interval from 2017-09-10 15:40:00 to 2017-09-10 16:20:00.
The script constructs the query and prints out the search results.
(Note: The fetch function is provided as a commented-out example.)

# Construct the query for SDO/AIA data.
# According to our VSO interface, SDO/AIA is available with intensity observations in multiple EUV channels.
# We will rely on the default wavelengths for AIA since the context implies the use of multi-channel EUV movies.
# Here, we explicitly set the source as 'SDO' and the instrument as 'AIA'.
