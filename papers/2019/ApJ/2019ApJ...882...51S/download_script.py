This script uses SunPy's VSO client to query STEREO-B in situ data from the IMPACT instrument package,
specifically the SWEA detector, which recorded solar wind electron data.
The query is based on the following details extracted from the paper:
    - Instrument: IMPACT (STEREO-B)
    - Detector: SWEA
    - Time Range: 2011 May 19 20:00 UT to 2011 May 20 20:00 UT

Note: The VSO interface provided includes STEREO_B data for the IMPACT package.
This script prints the query results. The actual data fetching commands (Fido.fetch)
are commented out.
