## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the evolution of a coronal cavity—from its long-lived quiescent phase to its eruptive phase associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). The study utilizes multi-vantage point observations from several spacecraft and ground‐based facilities. Data are collected in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) as well as in white light to monitor cavity morphology, kinematics, and magnetic properties (e.g., decay index). Observations begin with the cavity’s appearance on the east limb on 2010 May 30 and continue as it rotates across the disk, culminating with its eruption from the west limb on 2010 June 13. Instrumentation from SDO/AIA, STEREO SECCHI/EUVI (from both STEREO-A and STEREO-B), PROBA2/SWAP, LASCO C2/C3, a ground‐based Mk4 coronagraph, and an Hα imaging system are combined to track the cavity’s evolution and to relate its EUV appearance to its white-light counterpart.
