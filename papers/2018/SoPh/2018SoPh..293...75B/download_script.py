This script demonstrates a Sunpy VSO query to download data from SOHO instruments, 
specifically using data from the EIT and LASCO instruments in the year 2002.
The query parameters are chosen based on the context provided. The time range is set 
to cover the entire year 2002, which was critical for the study, and the instruments selected 
are SOHO/EIT (to detect solar disk features in extreme ultraviolet) and SOHO/LASCO (to track CMEs).
Note: The script prints out the query results. Data download commands (Fido.fetch) are commented out.
