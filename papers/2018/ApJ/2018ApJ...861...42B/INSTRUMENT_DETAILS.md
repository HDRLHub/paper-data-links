## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the cyclic variation of the coronal neon-to-oxygen (Ne/O) abundance ratio in the Sun when observed as a star. Utilizing daily-sampled full disk spectra acquired by multiple EUV and X-ray instruments, the study spans significant portions of the solar cycle (primarily from 2010 to 2014) to assess how the Ne/O ratio correlates with solar activity. The primary data are derived from the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) along with contextual imaging from the Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT). In addition, complementary archival data from SOHO’s CDS and SUMER instruments—and supporting high spectral resolution observations from Hinode’s EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) as well as cross-calibration using TIMED/SEE—are employed to refine the emission measure (EM) distributions and abundance diagnostics of the solar atmosphere.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)

- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We use SDO/EVE (Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, Woods et al. 2012) data for our analysis. EVE includes several instruments for measuring the solar EUV irradiance, including twin grating near-normal incidence spectrographs that observe in two wavelength bands from 50–370 ˚A and 350–1050 ˚A with a coarse spectral resolution of 1 ˚A.”

- **Physical Observable**:
   - Full disk integrated spectral irradiance measurements are recorded, which are later converted from SI units (W m⁻² nm⁻¹) to cgs intensity units (erg cm⁻² s⁻¹ sr⁻¹).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…the irradiance measurements ... are provided as hourly datasets” and “the observations are full disk integrated spectra.”

- **Additional Comments**:
   - Daily spectra are computed by median filtering all hourly datasets within each 24-hour period.
