## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the spatial and temporal thermal structure of a non-flaring, off-limb active region (AR 11459) observed at the west limb of the Sun between 27 and 28 April 2012. The study is centered on quantifying the very hot component of the AR plasma (above 3 MK, up to 10 MK), which discriminates between heating mechanisms. The primary sources of data are high-resolution spectroscopic observations from SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS, which together provide contiguous Fe ion coverage from Fe X to Fe XIX, as well as Ca XIV. Data are collected in coordinated campaigns using different slit positions and field centerings on both spectrometers, with time ranges and line selections targeting high-temperature diagnostics. The data form the basis for direct differential emission measure (DEM) and emission measure (EM) analyses—enabling quantification of persistent, spatially structured, very-hot plasma components across the off-limb AR.

## Instrumentation Details

### SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - Directly used for off-limb spectroscopic data collection with focus on Fe XVII, Fe XVIII, Fe XIX, and Ca XIV lines for high-temperature plasma diagnostics, covering several hours during 27–28 April 2012 at two different slit positions.
- **Supporting Quote**: "To minimize uncertainties in quantifying this plasma and its temperature, we used spectroscopic data from a single element (Fe). For the first time this type of analysis is carried out combining the SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS spectra allowing the observation of iron lines in contiguous ionization stage from Fe X to Fe XIX to be used."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Inner slit position, off-limb AR core observation
- **Time Range**: 2012-04-27T16:00:53 UT – 2012-04-27T18:47:11 UT; 2012-04-27T18:51:49 UT – 2012-04-27T21:38:05 UT; 2012-04-27T21:42:39 UT – 2012-04-28T00:28:58 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "SUMER: After the loss of Detector A in 2006...SUMER observed in a sit-and-stare mode using the 1′′ × 300′′ slit for about eight hours (16:02:08 UT to 00:28:58UT on the 27th) centered at a solar distance of 992′′. In the following this will be called slit position 1...For the first SUMER slit position 1, we found that the best way to proceed to co-align SUMER-AIA was to use the flare data (SUMER Fe XVIII and AIA 94 channel)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 943.59 Å (Ca XIV), 974.86 Å (Fe XVIII), 1118.06 Å (Fe XIX), 1153.1653 Å (Fe XVII)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For the first time this type of analysis is carried out combining the SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS spectra allowing the observation of iron lines in contiguous ionization stage from Fe X to Fe XIX to be used...A dataset covering all ionization stages from Fe X to Fe XIX has been used for the thermal analysis (both DEM and EM). Ca XIV is used for the SUMER-EIS radiometric cross-calibration."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission lines of highly ionized Fe and Ca tracing plasma temperatures from 3 MK up to ~10 MK—primarily detecting persistent hot plasma components and their spatial/temporal properties outside of flares.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We present an analysis using Fe and Ca emission lines from both SOHO/SUMER and HINODE/EIS. A dataset covering all ionization stages from Fe X to Fe XIX has been used for the thermal analysis (both DEM and EM). Ca XIV is used for the SUMER-EIS radiometric cross-calibration."
- **Additional Comments**: Use of extensive time-averaging and mask selection to improve faint line detection, and explicit discarding of flare-affected exposures.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "As the aim of this work is to investigate the quiescent conditions of ARs, the data affected by the flares were discarded from our analysis. Details of our data selection are given in the next Section."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Outer slit position, further off-limb
- **Time Range**: 2012-04-28T00:34:40 UT – 2012-04-28T03:29:55 UT; 2012-04-28T03:34:57 UT – 2012-04-28T06:30:12 UT; 2012-04-28T06:35:07 UT – 2012-04-28T09:30:23 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "A second sequence of observations, starting on the 28th at 00:35:55UT, was made by moving the pointing west of about 60′′. After a first sequence which used the same slit, the slit was changed to 4′′ × 300′′ when scanning Fe XVII and XIX (in the following we call this outer slit position as position 2, see also Table 1)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Same lines as above—943.59 Å (Ca XIV), 974.86 Å (Fe XVIII), 1118.06 Å (Fe XIX), 1153.1653 Å (Fe XVII)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For our lines ratio analysis we selected the temperature obtained in mask B, as it is the one where the Fe XIX is absent. This means that most of the Ca line emission is formed close to the EM peak temperature."
- **Physical Observable**: Same as period 1, with attention to spatial variation in high-temperature emission in regions further from the limb.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The decrease of the EM is noticeable with the increase in solar height. The difference between them is mainly found in the absence of Fe XIX for mask B."
- **Additional Comments**: Assessment of stray-light using SUMER point spread function and inter-instrument calibration with EIS using Ca XIV 943.59 Å.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We estimated this contribution in two ways (detailed in Appendix B)...To this line list we added Si VII to constrain the DEM and EM at low temperatures and Ca XIV, which was used for the intercalibration EIS-SUMER (see Sec. 6)."

### EIS (EUV Imaging Spectrometer) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided critical overlapping and contiguous spectral coverage for Fe X–Fe XVI and Ca XIV at slightly lower temperatures; used for DEM/EM analysis as a complement to SUMER, fielded at the same regions and times when possible.
- **Supporting Quote**: "EIS: EIS data consist of three rasters nominally pointed at the two SUMER slit center positions. Each raster was scanned in about two hours starting at 18:19:33 UT. The observing program used the 2′′ slit, which scanned eastward over 82 positions with 2′′step and 90 seconds exposure time. The final field of view is 164′′ × 376′′. Details of the observations are given in Table 1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlapping with SUMER slit position 1
- **Time Range**: 2012-04-27T18:19:33 UT – 2012-04-27T20:24:49 UT; 2012-04-27T20:24:55 UT – 2012-04-27T22:30:11 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "EIS data consist of three rasters nominally pointed at the two SUMER slit center positions. Each raster was scanned in about two hours starting at 18:19:33 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe X 257.26 Å, Fe XI 188.30 Å, Fe XII 192.39 Å, Fe XIII 202.04 Å, Fe XIV 264.79 Å, Fe XV 284.16 Å, Fe XVI 262.98 Å, Ca XIV 193.87 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We minimized the effect of the elements abundance, by selecting only lines from Fe ions. We have enough Fe ions to cover the temperature range 6 < log T < 6.95. ... To this line list we added Si VII to constrain the DEM and EM at low temperatures and Ca XIV, which was used for the intercalibration EIS-SUMER (see Sec. 6)."
- **Physical Observable**: Emission from Fe and Ca ions used to diagnose the temperature distribution (DEM/EM) of the AR plasma, observe structuring, and cross-calibrate with SUMER data.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We started by carrying out a co-alignment of the fields of views of EIS and SUMER, which was done by using the SDO/AIA images for reference."
- **Additional Comments**: Strict coalignment with SUMER and use of new radiometric calibration; attempted but failed detection of higher-temperature EIS lines beyond Fe XVI due to blending or faintness.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The EIS high temperature lines from ions above Ca XIV and Fe XVI were absent or unusable because they were too blended. We also tried to extract Ca XVII 192.853 Å but with no success."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Overlapping with SUMER slit position 2
- **Time Range**: 2012-04-27T23:01:40 UT – 2012-04-28T01:06:56 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Details of the observations are given in Table 1."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Same as above, including Fe X–Fe XVI and Ca XIV 193.87 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the high temperature plasma is only covered by the SUMER data. Our analysis was carried out over several masks as described in the following Sections."
- **Physical Observable**: Used to map EM/DEM spatial gradients above the limb at outer slit positions, and for radiometric cross-calibration with SUMER using Ca XIV 193.87 Å / 943.59 Å ratio.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For the following thermal analysis we used the GDZ factor."
- **Additional Comments**: Consistent use of the updated Del Zanna (2013a) (GDZ) radiometric calibration, with cross-checks against the Warren et al. (2014) (NRL) calibration.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For our analysis we used the Del Zanna (2013a) calibration, but a discussion of the influence on the results obtained using a different calibration is presented in Section 6."

### SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (context and mask selection only)
- **General Comments**:
  - Only used to provide contextual imaging, support coalignment, cross-check hot region variability, and estimate stray light, but NOT for quantitative DEM/EM analysis in this paper.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In our analysis we also used the continuous monitoring provided by SDO/AIA for reference and comparison."
  - **Note**: No AIA direct data appears in the DEM/EM reconstructions or core quantitative results.
