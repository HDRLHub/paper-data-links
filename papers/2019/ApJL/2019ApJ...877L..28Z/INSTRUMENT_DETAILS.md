## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates 16 failed filament eruptions observed from 2010 July to 2013 February. The authors use multi-view observations to reconstruct the 3D configuration of solar filaments and study their magnetic environment. Using instruments onboard SDO, STEREO, and SOHO, the study analyzes extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, photospheric magnetic fields, and white-light coronagraph data to determine filament heights, rotation angles, and decay indexes. These observational data are crucial in examining the role of torus instability and filament rotation in determining whether an eruption evolves into a coronal mass ejection (CME) or fails.

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is used to capture high-cadence, high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet images of the filaments. It plays a central role in visualizing filament evolution in narrow EUV passbands, enabling precise tracking of filament motion and structure.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board SDO can observe a filament in narrow extreme-UV (EUV) passbands including 304 ˚A (formation temperature Tf = 10^5K) and 193 ˚A (Tf = 1.58 × 10^6K) with a high cadence (12 s), high spatial resolution (0.′′6 per pixel), and large ﬁeld of view (FOV; 1.3R⊙)." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Event Observation Period
- **Time Range**: 2010 July – 2013 February  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Based on these criteria, we examine SDO/AIA and STEREO/EUVI data to search for suitable ﬁlament eruption events from 2010 July to 2013 February, during which the near-quadrature conﬁguration of STEREO A/B allows for the best 3D view of a solar eruption."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 ˚A and 193 ˚A  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…observe a ﬁlament in narrow extreme-UV (EUV) passbands including 304 ˚A … and 193 ˚A …"
- **Physical Observable**: Filament structure and evolution in the extreme-UV; tracking the filament’s rising motion and morphology.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Utilizing these multi-view observations, we apply 3D reconstruction to obtain the 3D conﬁguration and evolution of ﬁlaments of study."
- **Additional Comments**: The high cadence (12 s) and high spatial resolution (0.6 arcsec per pixel) of AIA allow detailed temporal and spatial study of filament eruptions.

### 2. Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO (Ahead/Behind)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI provides an additional vantage point by imaging filaments in similar EUV passbands, which is essential for 3D reconstruction of the filament structure. Its wide field of view complements AIA observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Meanwhile the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO provides another view of the ﬁlament at similar wavelengths, i.e. 304 ˚A (Tf = 6 ∼8 × 10^5K) and 195 ˚A (Tf = 1.4 × 10^6K) with a FOV of 1.7R⊙ (Howard et al. 2008)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Event Observation Period
- **Time Range**: 2010 July – 2013 February  
   - **Supporting Quote**: (See same observation period as for AIA) "…search for suitable ﬁlament eruption events from 2010 July to 2013 February…"
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 ˚A and 195 ˚A  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…at similar wavelengths, i.e. 304 ˚A … and 195 ˚A…"
- **Physical Observable**: Filament morphology from an alternative viewing angle, which facilitates accurate 3D reconstruction of filament height and rotation characteristics.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) A (Ahead), B (Behind) and Solar Dynamics Obser-vatory (SDO) provide us an unprecedented opportunity to observe ﬁlaments in a multi-view setting."
- **Additional Comments**: EUVI’s field of view of 1.7R⊙ supports capturing the full spatial extent of the erupting filaments.

### 3. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides photospheric vector magnetic field data necessary for magnetic field extrapolation and calculating the decay index above the filament regions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012), also on board SDO, provides photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data with a cadence up to 45s and a pixel size of 0.′′5."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Event Observation Period
- **Time Range**: 2010 July – 2013 February  
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implicitly used during the same period as the filament events analyzed throughout the paper.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field observations rather than specific wavelengths)  
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric vector magnetic field for extrapolation of the coronal magnetic field and evaluation of the decay index.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…to allow for the coronal magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation…" 
- **Additional Comments**: HMI’s high temporal cadence (up to 45 s) and fine spatial resolution (0.5 arcsec per pixel) are crucial for capturing the rapidly evolving magnetic field configuration in solar active regions.

### 4. LASCO-C2 Coronagraph on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO-C2 is utilized to determine the presence or absence of a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the filament eruption. Its white-light coronagraph images help differentiate between successful and failed eruptions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We have employed three diﬀerent coronagraphs, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)-C2 (Brueckner et al. 1995)…"

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Event Observation Period
- **Time Range**: 2010 July – 2013 February  
   - **Supporting Quote**: (The observation period for CME detection is the same as the event selection period: "…search for suitable ﬁlament eruption events from 2010 July to 2013 February…")
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband imaging in visible light)  
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of CMEs via white-light coronagraph images to verify whether a filament eruption resulted in an ejective CME or a failed eruption.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...to determine whether a ﬁlament eruption results in CME or not, i.e., a successful eruption or a failed eruption."
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO-C2 is one of the key instruments for checking the large-scale response of the corona to filament eruptions.

### 5. SECCHI-COR1 on board STEREO (Ahead/Behind)
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI-COR1 A and B are used in conjunction with LASCO-C2 to monitor the corona and identify any associated CME signals. These instruments provide complementary coronagraph imaging from the STEREO spacecraft.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "…and STEREO/Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)-COR1 A and B (Howard et al. 2008), to determine whether a ﬁlament eruption results in CME or not…"

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Event Observation Period
- **Time Range**: 2010 July – 2013 February  
   - **Supporting Quote**: (As with other instruments, the SECCHI observations are part of the overall period used for event selection: "from 2010 July to 2013 February…")
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light observations; specific passbands are not detailed.
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of CMEs (or lack thereof) by imaging the corona in white light, providing further evidence on whether the eruptive filament evolved into a CME.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...to determine whether a ﬁlament eruption results in CME or not…"
- **Additional Comments**: The coordinated observations using SECCHI-COR1 and LASCO-C2 increase the reliability of concluding a failed eruption when CME signatures are absent.
