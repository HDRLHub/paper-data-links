## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates non-stationary Quasi-Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) in high-energy particles during the impulsive phase of an X4.8 solar flare on July 23, 2002. The study utilizes data from multiple instruments, including the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP), and Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH), to analyze the quasi-periods in γ-ray line and continuum, hard X-ray (HXR), and radio emissions. The research aims to understand the acceleration and propagation processes of energetic ions and nonthermal electrons during solar flares, highlighting differences in quasi-periods between γ-ray line and continuum/HXR/radio emissions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI provides imaging spectroscopy of solar flares in soft X-ray (SXR), hard X-ray (HXR), and γ-ray emissions, covering energies from 3 keV to 17 MeV. It is crucial for analyzing the temporal and spatial characteristics of solar flare emissions.
- **Supporting Quote**: "RHESSI can provide SXR, HXR and γ-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares from 3 keV to 17 MeV (Lin et al. 2002)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of γ-ray line and continuum emissions
- **Time Range**: 00:25 UT – 00:33 UT on July 23, 2002
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (b) presents the full-disk light curves in HXR emissions at 50−100 keV (black) and 100−300 keV (red), as well as in γ-ray emissions at 300−500 keV (magenta), 700−1400 keV (green), and 2200−2300 keV (blue), respectively."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 50−100 keV, 100−300 keV, 300−500 keV, 700−1400 keV, 2200−2300 keV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (b) presents the full-disk light curves in HXR emissions at 50−100 keV (black) and 100−300 keV (red), as well as in γ-ray emissions at 300−500 keV (magenta), 700−1400 keV (green), and 2200−2300 keV (blue), respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: γ-ray line and continuum emissions, HXR emissions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The γ-ray line centered at 2223 keV is quite strong and extremely narrow, it is generated when the thermalized neutron captured by the ambient proton, regarded as the deuterium formation line."
- **Additional Comments**: The study focuses on the quasi-periodicity of γ-ray line and continuum emissions, revealing different quasi-periods for ions and electrons.

### Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP)
- **General Comments**:
   - NoRP provides solar radio fluxes with high temporal resolution at multiple frequencies, essential for studying radio emissions during solar flares.
- **Supporting Quote**: "NoRP could provide solar radio fluxes with an uniform resolution of 0.1 s at seven frequencies, such as 1 GHz, 2 GHz, 3.75 GHz, 9.4 GHz, 17 GHz, 35 GHz, and 80 GHz."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of radio emissions
- **Time Range**: 00:25 UT – 00:33 UT on July 23, 2002
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (c) shows solar radio fluxes normalized to their maximum values at three higher frequencies recorded by NoRP during 00:25−00:33 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17 GHz, 35 GHz, 80 GHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (c) shows solar radio fluxes normalized to their maximum values at three higher frequencies recorded by NoRP during 00:25−00:33 UT."
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emissions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The X4.8 flare was accompanied by a group of type III radio bursts, as shown by the context image measured by Wind/Waves at the low-frequency range of 0.02−13.825 MHz."
- **Additional Comments**: The radio emissions are used to identify the presence of escaping electrons and to study the quasi-periodicity in radio fluxes.

### Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - NoRH provides solar radio maps with high spatial resolution, useful for imaging the source regions of radio emissions during solar flares.
- **Supporting Quote**: "NoRH was designed to measure solar radio maps with a time cadence of 1 s at frequencies of 17 GHz and 34 GHz."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Imaging of radio source regions
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated, but concurrent with NoRP observations
   - **Supporting Quote**: "NoRH was designed to measure solar radio maps with a time cadence of 1 s at frequencies of 17 GHz and 34 GHz."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17 GHz, 34 GHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "NoRH was designed to measure solar radio maps with a time cadence of 1 s at frequencies of 17 GHz and 34 GHz."
- **Physical Observable**: Radio source regions
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The slight divergence could because that the HXR emission above 50 keV tends to appear in the double footpoint locations, while the radio emission in 17 GHz is dominated by the loop-top source, and the radio emission in 34 GHz moves closely to the footpoint locations."
- **Additional Comments**: NoRH data is used to compare the spatial locations of radio emissions with HXR and γ-ray sources.
