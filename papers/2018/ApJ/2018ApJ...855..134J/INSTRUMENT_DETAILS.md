## Summary of the Paper

- **Content Summary**:  
  The study investigates the formation of ultraviolet (UV) molecular hydrogen (H₂) emission in the Sun’s atmosphere by modeling the UV fluorescence spectrum and comparing synthetic models to observed spectra. The research specifically uses observed data from two solar UV spectrographs: the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS) from sounding rocket flights. The paper analyzes spectra over the wavelength range 1205–1550 Å, focusing especially on comparison with the SUMER quiet-Sun atlas and the HRTS light bridge spectrum. The study uses measured intensities from these instruments as fundamental inputs for simulating the irradiation conditions and for direct comparison with synthetic H₂ spectra generated from various one-dimensional atmospheric models. Precise observation dates are given for the HRTS light bridge spectrum (13 February 1978), and the SUMER observations are based on previously published quiet-Sun atlases.

### High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS)

- **General Comments**:
  - HRTS provided high spectral and spatial resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic data used for detailed analysis and direct comparison with synthetic spectra as well as for supplying observed UV transition region line intensities to simulate irradiation in the models.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The first observations of lines from the Lyman band of H2 were made using the High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS, Bartoe & Brueckner 1975). Lines from the Werner and Lyman bands of H2 were reported by Bartoe et al. (1979)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: HRTS light bridge atlas spectrum

- **Time Range**: 1978-02-13  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The light bridge spectrum of Brekke et al. (1991) comes from the sunspot observed during second flight of HRTS on 13 February 1978."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1205–1550 Å (as utilized in analysis/comparison)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "A detailed comparison to observations from 1205 to 1550 ˚A is presented, and the success of this 1D approach to modeling solar UV H2 emission is illustrated by the identification of previously unidentified lines and upper levels in HRTS spectra."
- **Physical Observable**: Ultraviolet emission lines of H₂; emission from transition region and chromospheric lines (eg. C II, Si IV)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We test the conditions under which H2 emission can originate by studying non-LTE models... When irradiated from above using observed intensities of bright UV emission lines, detailed non-LTE calculations show that the spectrum of H2 seen in the quiet-Sun SUMER atlas spectrum and HRTS light bridge spectrum can be satisfactorily reproduced..."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The analysis uses the atlas spectrum of a sunspot light bridge observed by HRTS for direct spectral comparison and for the irradiation scenario in modeling.
  - Intensity values from the HRTS light bridge spectrum are tabulated and compared with modeled results for specific H₂ lines and excitation sources.
  - Spectral plots and new line identifications are based on this data set.

### Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - The SUMER instrument provided the quiet-Sun reference UV spectral atlas, which forms a primary observation set for validation of the non-LTE atmospheric models. Observed line irradiances from SUMER are also used as inputs for simulating chromospheric UV illumination in the calculations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The transition region line intensities given in Table 1 are used as the input spectrum. ...the SUMER atlas of Curdt et al. (2001) shown in Table 1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: SUMER quiet-Sun atlas spectrum

- **Time Range**: Not explicitly dated in text, but refers to the published SUMER quiet-Sun atlas (Curdt et al. 2001, data acquired primarily 1996–1998)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the SUMER quiet-Sun atlas spectrum (Curdt et al. 2001)"
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1205–1550 Å (as utilized in analysis/comparison)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "A detailed comparison to observations from 1205 to 1550 ˚A is presented, and the success of this 1D approach to modeling solar UV H2 emission is illustrated by the identification of previously unidentified lines and upper levels in HRTS spectra."
- **Physical Observable**: Ultraviolet emission lines of H₂ and solar transition region/chromospheric lines
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The SUMER quiet-Sun spectrum is compared to the FALC and COX ×1 multiplier (top panels), while the HRTS light bridge spectrum is compared to the FALC and COX ×100 multiplier for the down-going radiation (bottom panels)."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The SUMER atlas data is used for both absolute line intensity measurements and for extracting integrated line intensities for chromospheric and transition region UV lines (H I Ly α, C II, Si IV, etc) that are direct inputs to the irradiation simulations.
  - Measurements from this data set are provided in Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper, and are used for modeling and for benchmark comparison with synthetic spectra.
  - The principal goal is to match observed H₂ line intensities and ratios in the SUMER quiet-Sun spectrum with those predicted by the 1D models under the measured irradiation.
