## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a new regularized method for estimating power spectra from unevenly spaced time series, with a focus on applications to solar helioseismic data. The research objectives include developing and validating the method on simulated data and directly applying it to actual helioseismic velocity measurements. Critically, the study uses data from the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument onboard the SOHO spacecraft, explicitly processing and analyzing a 23-day time series of helioseismic radial velocity measurements with engineered observing windows to simulate the impact of ground-based data gaps. Key observational elements central to the findings are the time series’ time range, sampling cadence, and the physical observable—solar oscillation velocities. These data underpin both the methodological demonstration and the quantitative evaluation of the spectral estimation technique.

## Instrumentation Details

### GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - GOLF observational data form the core real-world testbed for the study’s new regularization method; helioseismic radial velocity time series from GOLF are purposely masked with simulated ground-based windows for analysis of spectral retrieval under realistic data loss conditions.
- **Supporting Quote**: "we preferred to use data from the GOLF experiment under typical observing windows from the IRIS network. The GOLF experiment on the SoHO mission aims at studying the internal structure of the Sun by measuring the spectrum of global oscillations in the frequency range 10\(^{-7}\) to 10\(^{-2}\) Hz. Both p- and g-mode oscillations are investigated, with the emphasis on the low-order long-period waves that penetrate the solar core. For the purpose of our demonstration, we used almost 23 d (corresponding to 32 768 points) of radial velocity data from the PM1 detector (Garcia et al. 2005). The data are regularly sampled and the temporal cadence of the time series is 60 s."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Application of the regularization method to GOLF helioseismic time series
- **Time Range**: [23 days corresponding to 32,768 data points; explicit start/end dates are not directly quoted, but full duration is specified as approximately 23 days]
  - **Supporting Quote**: "we used almost 23 d (corresponding to 32 768 points) of radial velocity data from the PM1 detector (Garcia et al. 2005). The data are regularly sampled and the temporal cadence of the time series is 60 s."
- **Wavelength(s)**: [Not explicitly quoted; GOLF’s spectral band is not specifically cited in the text, so not reportable per instructions.]
- **Physical Observable**: Solar global oscillation radial velocity (helioseismic velocity)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "we used almost 23 d (corresponding to 32 768 points) of radial velocity data from the PM1 detector (Garcia et al. 2005)."
- **Additional Comments**: Data are used both as a contiguous “reference” spectrum and with artificial introduction of gaps according to modeled ground-based observing windows to test the retrieval power of the proposed regularization method.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We then apply an observing window with gaps from 1 to 2000 points for a total of 24 910 missing points out of 32 768. The observing window and the corresponding GOLF signal are presented in Fig. 7."
