## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the solar cycle dependency on the presence and periodicity of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) using helioseismic techniques. It utilizes solar oscillation frequencies from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG), Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), and Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager (HMI) to study frequency shifts over Solar Cycles 23 and 24. Additionally, it examines solar activity proxies, specifically the ùêπ10.7 index and the Mg ii index, over the last four solar cycles to study the associated QBO. The analysis methods include Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The study finds a reduced presence of the QBO in Cycle 24 compared to Cycle 23 and suggests that the magnetic field responsible for producing the QBO is anchored above approximately 0.95 R‚äô.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to query the VSO for data from the GONG, MDI, and HMI instruments over the specified time ranges for Solar Cycles 23 and 24. We will use the SunPy library to construct these queries. The queries will be based on the time ranges and instruments specified in the context. We will print out the query results and comment out the Fido.fetch commands.
