## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes extreme events in the solar wind and their impact on the magnetosphere using extreme value theory (EVT). The study makes use of a 20‐year dataset from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft (1998–2017). Key solar wind physical observables such as the solar proton speed, temperature, density, and magnetic field components are measured by on‐board instruments. The analysis employs EVT to estimate return levels for one-in-40-year and one-in-80-year events. Multiple instruments with different temporal resolutions (12 minutes for plasma measurements and 4 minutes for magnetic field data) are used to capture solar wind variations over this period.

### 1. Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM/ACE) on board the ACE Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - SWEPAM/ACE is used to measure key plasma parameters of the solar wind including the solar proton speed (v), temperature (T), and indirectly contributes to determining the proton density when combined with SWICS measurements.
   - The instrument provides a temporal resolution of 12 minutes for the data used in this study, even though higher resolutions are available.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "On one hand, the data set contains the solar proton speed (v) (with an energy range between 0.5 and 100 KeV), the solar proton density (N) and the solar proton temperature (T) from the Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM/ACE) [McComas et al., 1998] ... with a temporal resolution of 12 minutes."
   
#### Data Collection Period: 1998–2017 (ACE Mission – First 20 Years)
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "... level 2 data from 1998 to 2017 from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft ..."  
- **Wavelength(s) / Energy Range**:
   - Energy range for the solar proton speed is between 0.5 and 100 KeV.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "... the solar proton speed (v) (with an energy range between 0.5 and 100 KeV) ..."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Measures the solar proton speed and temperature which are critical for characterizing the dynamic properties of the solar wind.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "… the solar proton speed (v), solar proton temperature (T) …"
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although SWEPAM is capable of a higher temporal resolution (64 seconds available), the study intentionally uses the 12-minute resolution dataset for consistency across instruments.

### 2. Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS/ACE) on board the ACE Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - SWICS/ACE complements SWEPAM by contributing to the measurement of solar wind properties, particularly for solar proton density (N).
   - Like SWEPAM, the data is utilized with a 12-minute temporal resolution to maintain consistency in the analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "… the solar proton density (N) … from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS/ACE) [Gloeckler et al., 1998] with a temporal resolution of 12 minutes."
   
#### Data Collection Period: 1998–2017 (ACE Mission – First 20 Years)
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "... level 2 data from 1998 to 2017 from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft ..."
- **Wavelength(s) / Energy Range**:
   - No explicit wavelength data is provided; instead, SWICS/ACE is focused on measuring ion composition and density.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Provides measurements related to solar wind ion composition and specifically solar proton density.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "… the solar proton density (N) …"
- **Additional Comments**:
   - This instrument works in tandem with SWEPAM to provide a comprehensive characterization of the solar wind plasma parameters.

### 3. Magnetometer (MAG) on board the ACE Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - MAG is dedicated to measuring the interplanetary magnetic field, including its total magnitude (B) and the Z-component (Bz).
   - The magnetic field measurements are central to assessing the solar wind’s impact on the magnetosphere (e.g., through the derived solar wind electric field, E = v|Bz|).
   - The analysis uses a 4-minute temporal resolution for the magnetic field data, even though higher resolution data (1 second) are available.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "… on the other hand, the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude (B) and Z component (Bz) from the magnetometer (MAG) [Smith et al., 1998] with a temporal resolution of 4 minutes …"
   
#### Data Collection Period: 1998–2017 (ACE Mission – First 20 Years)
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "… level 2 data from 1998 to 2017 from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft …"
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not applicable since the instrument measures magnetic field strengths rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Primary observables include the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude (B) and its Z-component (Bz), which are key in analyzing space weather events and their effects on the magnetosphere.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "… the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude (B) and Z component (Bz) …"
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although MAG has higher available temporal resolution (1 second), for consistency with the study the resolution is fixed at 4 minutes; additionally, the Bz measurements are later resampled to match the 12-minute resolution used for other parameters when deriving the solar wind electric field.
