## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on constructing neutral temperature and density profiles of Saturn's equatorial upper atmosphere using data from Cassini's Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) during its final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017. This data is combined with previous measurements from the Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) and the UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS). The study employs an energy deposition model to calculate ion production rates and methane photo-dissociation rates, assessing the impact of spectral resolution on these processes. The findings highlight the importance of high-resolution H2 photo-absorption cross sections in modeling Saturn's ionosphere.

## Instrumentation Details

### Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) on board Cassini
- **General Comments**:
   - The INMS was used to measure the neutral atmospheric composition of Saturn during Cassini's final plunge, providing data on the densities of H2, He, and CH4.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measured neutral atmospheric composition down to the pressure level of about 1 nbar during the final plunge."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Final Plunge
- **Time Range**: September 15, 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "measurements from Cassini’s Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) taken during the spacecraft’s final plunge into Saturn’s atmosphere on 15 September 2017"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Neutral atmospheric composition (densities of H2, He, CH4)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The INMS final plunge measurements provide densities of H2, He, and CH4, at pressures up to 1 nbar."
- **Additional Comments**: The INMS data was crucial for reconstructing the neutral atmosphere and understanding the inflow of methane from Saturn's rings.

- **Additional Comments**: CIRS data was used in conjunction with UVIS to create a comprehensive temperature profile.

### UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) on board Cassini
- **General Comments**:
   - UVIS provided stellar occultation data that contributed to the temperature profile of Saturn's atmosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**: "To reconstruct the neutral atmosphere down to the 1 bar pressure level, we rely on previously combined CIRS limb scans and UVIS stellar occultation observations."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)"
- **Physical Observable**: Temperature profile
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We combine temperature measurements from CIRS and UVIS taken close to Saturn’s equator with INMS temperatures taken during the final plunge."
- **Additional Comments**: UVIS data was essential for extending the temperature profile to lower altitudes.

### TIMED/SEE, SOHO/SUMER, and WHI Campaign
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments provided solar flux data at various spectral resolutions used in the energy deposition model.
- **Supporting Quote**: "These neutral profiles are fed into an energy deposition model employing soft X-ray and Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) solar fluxes at a range of spectral resolutions (∆λ = 4×10−3 nm to 1 nm) assembled from TIMED/SEE, from SOHO/SUMER, and from the Whole Heliosphere Interval (WHI) quiet Sun campaign."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Flux Measurements
- **Time Range**: Various dates in 1997 and 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The WHI dataset is composed of measurements from the XPS instrument on TIMED/SEE between 0.1 – 6.0 nm, a rocket measurement between 6.0 – 105 nm, the EGS instrument on TIMED/SEE between 105 – 116 nm, and a SORCE/SOLSTICE spectrum beyond 116 nm. The rocket was launched on 14 April 2008, and the TIMED/SEE and SORCE/SOLSTICE spectra that compose the WHI spectrum are averages over 10 – 16 April 2008."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.1 to 152 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The SUMER spectrum extends from 67 to 152 nm at a resolution of 4 × 10−3 nm."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar flux
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Our energy deposition model calculates ion production rate profiles through photo-ionisation and electron-impact ionisation processes."
- **Additional Comments**: The solar flux data was critical for modeling the ionization processes in Saturn's atmosphere.
