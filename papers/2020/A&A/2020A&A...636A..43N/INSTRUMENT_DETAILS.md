## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates solar brightness variations by modelling the impact of the Sun’s magnetic features—namely spots and faculae—on the observed solar variability. Using a Surface Flux Transport Model (SFTM) and the SATIRE approach, the authors simulate how solar brightness changes over timescales ranging from days to years and examine the dependence on the viewing inclination (from equator-on to polar views). Comparisons are made with observational data from several sources, including ground-based and space-based instruments, to understand solar variability in the context of stellar observations. Although the study leverages simulated magnetograms from 1700 to 2009, the paper also compares model output with data from instruments such as the PMOD composite as well as brightness measurements in specific passbands (Kepler, TESS, and Strömgren filters).

### 1. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
- **General Comments**:
  - Provides synoptic maps and full-disc images of the Sun.
  - Its observations are used to study long‐term solar irradiance variability, for example, in models that aim to assess climate responses to changes in the solar viewing angle.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “For example, to account for possible long-term climate response to the change of the Earth’s orbital inclination in relation to solar equator, Vieira et al. (2012) developed a model based on combining synoptic maps and disk images obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012) data.”
- **Time Range**: 
  - Not explicitly provided in the context.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**: 
  - Although the specific wavelength range and detector details are not described in the provided text, HMI data traditionally covers Doppler and magnetic field measurements across the solar disc.

### 2. CNES’ CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transit)
- **General Comments**:
  - A space-based planet-hunting mission that has contributed to the study of stellar brightness variations.
  - Its observations help place the Sun’s photometric variability in a broader stellar context.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Recent planet-hunting missions such as CNES’ CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transit, Baglin et al. 2006; Bordé et al. 2003)...”
- **Time Range**:
  - The context does not specify an explicit observational period for CoRoT.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
  - Specific details on passbands or detectors are not described; general sensitivity to stellar lightcurves is implied.

### 3. NASA’s Kepler
- **General Comments**:
  - A major space telescope used for detecting exoplanets, also providing high-precision stellar brightness measurements.
  - In this study, the variability in solar brightness is modelled as it would appear in the Kepler passband, with analyses performed for different viewing inclinations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Recent planet-hunting missions such as ... NASA’s Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010)…” 
  - “We now consider the variability during cycles 19 and 22 as it would be observed by Kepler.”
- **Time Range**:
  - No explicit dates or time ranges for Kepler observations are provided in the text.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Kepler’s filter profile “covers almost the whole visual wavelength range.”
  - **Supporting Quote**: “...the primary goal of Kepler was to find planets around solar-type stars and its filter profile covers almost the whole visual wavelength range.”
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Total solar irradiance (TSI) variations and light curves modulated by solar rotation and evolution of magnetic features.

### 4. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
- **General Comments**:
  - A space telescope aimed at observing a large sample of stars, especially M dwarfs.
  - The study incorporates simulated brightness variations as they would be seen by TESS, highlighting its sensitivity to the red portion of the spectrum.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS, Ricker et al. 2014)...”
- **Time Range**:
  - The provided context does not offer a specific observational time range for TESS.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - TESS is “more sensitive to the red part of the spectrum.”
  - **Supporting Quote**: “TESS is aimed at observing a large number of M dwarfs and is, consequently, more sensitive to the red part of the spectrum.”
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Solar (or stellar) brightness variations, as computed over different timescales.

### 5. PMOD Composite (Physikalisch-Meterologisches Observatorium Davos Composite)
- **General Comments**:
  - Provides high-quality total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements over several decades.
  - In this study, PMOD data is utilized as a benchmark for comparing power spectra derived from the model (SATIRE variants) and for evaluating solar cycle variability.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “We use the Physikalisch-Meterologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD) composite (Fröhlich 2006, version 42_65_1709, ftp://ftp.pmodwrc.ch/pub/data), which provides TSI measurements over several decades.”
- **Time Range**:
  - While an exact date range is not provided, the text mentions that cycles 22 and 23 are used for model parameter determination, and that cycle 21 contained data gaps. Thus, the data span “several decades” including at least cycles 22 and 23.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
  - Focused on the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI); specific wavelengths are not listed because TSI is an integrated measure of solar output across the spectrum.

### 6. Strömgren Filter Systems (Strömgren b and y)
- **General Comments**:
  - A set of narrow-band photometric filters used in ground-based observations of stellar brightness variations.
  - They are employed here to compare solar brightness variability across different passbands, with attention to the variation in contrast between the facular and spot contributions.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “We consider the Strömgren filters b and y which have been widely used in groundbased observations to study long-term stellar photometric variability (Radick et al. 2018)...”
- **Time Range**:
  - No specific observational time ranges are provided for the Strömgren observations in the context.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Strömgren b is centered at 476 nm.
    - **Supporting Quote**: “The Strömgren b and y filters are centred at 476 and 547 nm, respectively...”
  - Strömgren y is centered at 547 nm.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Photometric brightness variations measured in narrow-band filters to isolate different spectral regions of the solar output.
