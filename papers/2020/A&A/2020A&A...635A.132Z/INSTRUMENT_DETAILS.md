## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study reports the multiwavelength observations of a very long filament in active region AR 11112 on 2010 October 18. The filament, divided into an eastern part (EP) and a western part (WP), was observed to exhibit large-amplitude, longitudinal oscillations that were enhanced by two homologous C-class flares. The research utilizes observations in Hα, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), ultraviolet (UV), white-light (WL), as well as soft X-ray (SXR) and magnetogram measurements from various space- and ground-based instruments. The observational time ranges span from early morning (around 07:00 UT) for spaceborne EUV and magnetograms to later times (up to 22:00 UT) for several channels, with white-light coronagraph observations capturing the evolution of a narrow, jet-like CME between 16:50 UT and 17:48 UT. These multi-instrument and multiwavelength data are key to diagnosing the filament’s oscillatory behavior and its enhancement by flares.
