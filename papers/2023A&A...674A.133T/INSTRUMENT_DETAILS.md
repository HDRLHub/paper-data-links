## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the role of interplanetary (IP) shocks in accelerating MeV electrons, particularly focusing on events between 2007 and 2019. The study utilizes data from the High Energy Telescope (HET) aboard the STEREO spacecraft to identify potential electron energetic storm particle (ESP) events. The research aims to determine if IP shocks can continue to accelerate electrons up to 1 AU distance. A new filtering method is introduced to assess the statistical significance of particle intensity increases, and the study identifies nine clear cases of significant MeV electron increases associated with IP shocks.

## Instrumentation Details

### High Energy Telescope (HET) on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - The HET is part of the Solar Energetic Particle subsystem, which is part of the In-situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients investigation (IMPACT) on the STEREO spacecraft. It measures high-energy particles, including protons and electrons, in various energy channels.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of potential electron ESP events
- **Time Range**: January 2007 – April 2019
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The list starts at the beginning of the STEREO mission in January 2007 and the latest update is on April 2019."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HET measures the highest energy particles including protons in eleven energy channels from 13.6 to >100 MeV and electrons in three energy channels from 0.7 to 4.0 MeV."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton and electron intensities
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HET measures the highest energy particles including protons in eleven energy channels from 13.6 to >100 MeV and electrons in three energy channels from 0.7 to 4.0 MeV."
- **Additional Comments**: The study focuses on identifying significant increases in MeV electron intensities associated with IP shocks.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Specific events with significant MeV electron increases
- **Time Range**: Various specific dates between 2007 and 2019
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Out of the 27 candidate IP shock events observed by STEREO A and B, nine (∼1.5%) turned out to have significant relativistic electron intensity enhancements."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HET measures the highest energy particles including protons in eleven energy channels from 13.6 to >100 MeV and electrons in three energy channels from 0.7 to 4.0 MeV."
- **Physical Observable**: Electron intensity enhancements
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Our method identified nine clear cases, where a significant increase of MeV electrons was found in association with a shock."
- **Additional Comments**: The highest statistical significance was observed in the highest of the three HET energy channels (2.8–4.0 MeV).
