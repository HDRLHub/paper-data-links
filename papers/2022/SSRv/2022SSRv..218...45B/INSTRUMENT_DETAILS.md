## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reviews the current understanding of the outer heliosphere and the local interstellar medium (LISM) based on observations and modeling of interplanetary Lyman-α emission. The emission is produced by solar Lyman-α photons backscattered by interstellar hydrogen atoms entering the heliosphere from the LISM. The study highlights the deceleration, heating, and velocity shift of interstellar hydrogen atoms compared to helium atoms, supporting the existence of a Hydrogen Wall beyond the heliosphere. The paper discusses various instruments and missions that have contributed to these findings, including SOHO/SWAN, Voyager/UVS, and New Horizons/Alice, among others. The review also outlines open scientific questions and potential future experiments.
