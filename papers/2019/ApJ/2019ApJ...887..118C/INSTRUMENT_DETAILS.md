## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed observational study of the early evolution of a hot-channel-like coronal mass ejection (CME) flux‐rope. Using multi-wavelength imaging and magnetic field extrapolation methods, the authors investigate the pre‐flare heating and spatial enlargement of an MFR (magnetic flux rope) as well as its associated footpoint drift. The study relies on data recorded across multiple instruments that capture the coronal, chromospheric, and photospheric layers over clearly defined periods during the event on 2014 March 20. These elements are critical in understanding the role of three-dimensional reconnection processes, the formation of flare ribbons and core dimmings, and the complexities of CME initiation.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA provides full-disk extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet (UV) imaging of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona. It operates through 10 different passbands, covering a wide temperature range (0.06–20 MK) with a high temporal cadence of 12 s and a pixel size of 0.6″. In this study, specific passbands such as 131 Å, 94 Å, 211 Å, and 193 Å are used to analyze the formation and eruption of the hot channel, while 304 Å and 1600 Å channels are applied to study chromospheric flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The AIA provides the full-disk EUV/UV imaging observations of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere up to the corona through 10 passbands, with a pixel size of 0.′′6, high temporal cadence (12 s), and wide temperature range (0.06−20 MK); … We choose 131, 94, 211 and 193 ˚A images to analysis the detailed formation and eruption of the hot channel, and apply 304 and 1600 ˚A images to study its related chromospheric FRs.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Precursor and Formation Phase of the Hot Channel
- **Time Range**: Approximately 03:30 UT – 03:43 UT on 2014 March 20
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Figure 2 presents the buildup of the hot channel in 131 ˚A images during the precursor phase (03:30−03:43 UT)...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å (primary), with additional use of 94 Å, 211 Å, and 193 Å for coronal diagnostics, and 304 Å and 1600 Å for chromospheric signatures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “We choose 131, 94, 211 and 193 ˚A images … and apply 304 and 1600 ˚A images…”
- **Physical Observable**: Imaging of the coronal structures (e.g., the heating and development of the hot-channel-like MFR) and detailed evolution of chromospheric flare ribbons.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Following the above-mentioned photospheric flux cancellation, a preceding plasma heating signal was ﬁrst captured … In panel (b5), an obvious writhed elbow can be noticed at its east feet.”

#### Additional Comments:
- The AIA data continuously cover the eruption phases with high cadence, capturing dynamic changes such as the slow rise, rapid expansion, and subsequent flare ribbon dynamics associated with the CME.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is responsible for measuring the full-disk photospheric magnetic fields through both line-of-sight (LOS) and vector magnetograms. With a pixel size of 0.5″, HMI provides essential magnetic context which is used to study the evolution of the photospheric magnetic configuration and to perform non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The HMI measures the full-disk photospheric magnetic ﬁelds at 6173 ˚A, providing routine line-of-sight (LOS) and vector magnetograms …”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-eruptive Magnetic Configuration
- **Time Range**: Magnetogram obtained at 03:12 UT on 2014 March 20
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “To check the pre‐flare magnetic conﬁguration… we also choose the vector magnetogram for extrapolation at 03:12 UT from the HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) product.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 6173 Å (for magnetic field measurement)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “The HMI measures the full-disk photospheric magnetic ﬁelds at 6173 ˚A…”
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field distribution (both LOS and vector components) used to determine the pre-existing seed MFR and to support the NLFFF extrapolation.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Before being taken as the bottom boundary, the vector magnetogram is ‘pre-processed’ … using the NLFFF package …, we build an NLFFF model…”

#### Additional Comments:
- HMI data are integral for understanding the magnetic environment in which the hot channel forms, particularly through its vector magnetogram data used for topology analysis and field extrapolation.

### 3. New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) at Fuxian Solar Observatory, China
- **General Comments**:
   - The NVST is designed to observe the Sun with high temporal and spatial resolutions. It operates in the Hα spectral line at 6562.8 Å with a bandwidth of 0.25 Å, allowing for high-resolution studies of the solar chromosphere. Its raw data are calibrated and transformed to Level 1+ using speckle masking reconstruction techniques.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The NVST is designed to observe the Sun with high temporal (12 s) and spatial (0.′′165) resolutions, and now it images the solar chromosphere at the emission line of Hα 6562.8 ˚A with a bandwidth of 0.25 ˚A.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-flare Phase Imaging
- **Time Range**: 01:24:45 UT – 01:53:13 UT on 2014 March 20
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “On 2014 March 20, NVST focused on the NOAA active region (AR) 12010 with a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 180′′ × 180′′, thus respectively covers the pre‐flare (01:24:45-01:53:13 UT)…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα 6562.8 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…images the solar chromosphere at the emission line of Hα 6562.8 ˚A with a bandwidth of 0.25 ˚A.”
- **Physical Observable**: High-resolution chromospheric structures and responses. These observations help to trace the intensity changes and fine spatial dynamics such as the rapid diminishment of the west core dimming and the evolution of flare ribbons.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Accordingly, we adopted the Level 1+ NVST Hα observations to investigate the related chromospheric responses before and during the ﬂare…”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Decay Phase Imaging
- **Time Range**: 03:54:10 UT – 05:40:55 UT on 2014 March 20
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…and decay phase (03:54:10-05:40:55 UT) of this ﬂare event.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα 6562.8 Å (same as above)
- **Physical Observable**: Continued chromospheric evolution during the decay phase, providing insight into post-flare phenomena and the recovery or disappearance of dimming regions.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…NVST Hα images reveal the rapid diminishment of the west core dimming and the formation of atypical flare loops.”

#### Additional Comments:
- The two distinct NVST observation periods allow the authors to compare chromospheric features before the flare onset and during the later decay phase.

### 4. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO/C2) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 is used to observe the higher corona and detect CMEs as they propagate outward from the Sun. Its coronagraph images provide an extended view of the eruptive phenomena initiated by the hot-channel-like flux-rope.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “By the time of 05:12 UT, an corresponding CME was detected in the coronagraph observations from Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Detection Snapshot
- **Time Range**: Observation recorded at approximately 05:12 UT on 2014 March 20
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “By the time of 05:12 UT, an corresponding CME was detected…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: LASCO/C2 observes in white-light coronagraphic channels (specific wavelength details are not provided).
- **Physical Observable**: The appearance of the nascent CME, characterized by its inner hot core seen in 131 Å images (but observed as a dark cavity in 211 Å images), and the leading edge (LE) formation in the low corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…the eruptive hot channel soon developed as a nascent CME … its inner core corresponds to a high-temperature eruptive MFR, and its shell corresponds to a low-temperature leading edge (LE).”

#### Additional Comments:
- Although LASCO/C2 provides a snapshot detection time rather than a continuous observational period, its observation at 05:12 UT confirms the CME evolution initiated by the erupting hot-channel-like MFR.
