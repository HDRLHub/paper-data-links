## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the propagation and interaction of three successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that occurred on 2001 November 21–22, using coordinated data from coronagraph imaging (near-Sun CME observations), type II radio burst measurements (tracking shocks through the heliosphere), and multi-point in situ solar wind and magnetic field measurements at Earth and Ulysses (for interplanetary CME/shock signatures). The central research goal is to connect the evolution and interactions of these successive CMEs—and particularly their resulting shocks—with distinct features in a long-duration complex type II radio burst, thereby characterizing the Sun-to-Earth shock propagation in the absence of wide-angle imaging. Observation periods span the CME onset at the Sun, their interplanetary transit (including shock arrival times at spacecraft at 1 AU and 2.34 AU), and the entire duration of the associated type II radio bursts. Key to the findings are: 1) direct near-Sun CME imaging by SOHO LASCO; 2) Wind spacecraft radio spectral data for type II burst events; 3) continuous in situ plasma/magnetic field monitoring at Wind, ACE, and Ulysses; and 4) particle flux measurements by GOES. These comprehensive, directly analyzed data streams are integral to the reconstruction of CME propagation, shock dynamics, and radio emission signatures across the Sun-Earth-Ulysses system.

### SOHO/LASCO Coronagraph on board SOHO spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for direct imaging of CMEs near the Sun to determine launch times, initial speeds, and propagation directions by applying the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) modeling technique to LASCO images.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 displays the coronagraph observations of the three CMEs of interest from SOHO. ... We use a graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) method to estimate CME propagation direction and speed, which assumes a rope-like morphology for CMEs with two ends anchored at the Sun (Thernisien et al. 2006). The coronagraph images can be well reproduced by this forward modeling technique..."
