## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study analyzes twenty-one years of helioseismology data to investigate cyclic variations in the Sun’s seismic radius. By measuring precise changes in the frequencies of surface gravity (f) modes, the paper examines how the subsurface structure of the Sun is affected by magnetic fields during solar activity cycles. Data are collected from two space missions using two distinct helioseismic instruments. The observations span two solar cycles with the early period dominated by SoHO/MDI data and the later period by SDO/HMI data. This long-term dataset allowed the authors to resolve previous uncertainties regarding the solar radius variations and provided insights into subsurface displacement, with specific focus on depth intervals (e.g., around 5±2 Mm).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument provided the earlier helioseismic data covering the initial phase of the study. MDI was responsible for acquiring full-disk Dopplergrams used to measure f-mode oscillation frequencies and infer variations in the seismic radius.
  - It is part of the SoHO mission and contributed to the data analyses before the transition to SDO/HMI.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "Here, we use helioseismology data obtained in 1996-2017 from two NASA missions: Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) (1996-2010) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (2010-2017). ... The MDI data cover the initial period until 03/20/2011, and the HMI data cover the rest."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: SoHO/MDI Observations
- **Time Range**: April 30, 1996 – March 20, 2011
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We study the whole time span ranging from April 30, 1996, to June 4, 2017. The MDI data cover the initial period until 03/20/2011..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
  - Not explicitly provided; the instrument measured oscillation signals via full-disk Dopplergrams associated with surface gravity (f) modes.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The mode frequency analysis is performed using 72-day series of full-disk Dopplergrams."
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Measures the oscillation frequencies of f-modes, which are sensitive to the solar subsurface structure and gravity acceleration.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Helioseismology provides means to measure with high precision the radial displacement of subsurface layers, called ‘seismic radius’, through analysis of oscillation frequencies of surface gravity (f) modes."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Data from MDI were crucial in establishing baseline measurements of the seismic radius before the transition to higher resolution observations.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument provided the latter part of the helioseismic observations, ensuring uniform data processing with high-resolution Dopplergrams. HMI data were tailored to match the spatial resolution of the MDI Medium-ℓ Structure Program.
  - It allowed for reduced systematic annual variations and improved the quality of f-mode frequency measurements during the latter phase of observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The HMI high-resolution data are specially prepared to match the spatial resolution of the MDI Medium-ℓ Structure Program (Kosovichev et al. 1997), and perform uniform data processing from the two instruments."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: SDO/HMI Observations
- **Time Range**: March 20, 2011 – June 4, 2017
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The MDI data cover the initial period until 03/20/2011, and the HMI data cover the rest." (Implying HMI data span from March 20, 2011 until the end of the study on June 4, 2017.)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not explicitly detailed; similar to MDI, HMI acquired full-disk Dopplergrams that were used to analyze f-mode oscillations.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The mode frequency analysis is performed using 72-day series of full-disk Dopplergrams." (This applies uniformly to the dataset processed from both instruments.)
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Like MDI, HMI measured oscillation frequencies of surface gravity (f) modes to derive the seismic radius and its variations.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Helioseismology provides means to measure with high precision the radial displacement of subsurface layers... through analysis of oscillation frequencies of surface gravity (f) modes."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The reduction of annual systematic variations and improved resolution with HMI data were significant for resolving differences in seismic radius variations between Solar Cycles 23 and 24.
