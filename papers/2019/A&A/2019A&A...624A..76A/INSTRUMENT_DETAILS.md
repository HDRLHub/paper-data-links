# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates spike–like fine structures embedded in type-II solar radio bursts. The study uses high time resolution dynamic spectra to analyze narrowband, short-duration features that appear during type II bursts. Data were obtained from multiple instruments, including receivers of the ARTEMIS-IV solar radio spectrograph and coronagraph measurements from the LASCO instrument on board the SoHO mission. In particular, the paper exploits the high sensitivity and 10 ms cadence of the SAO receiver (covering 450–270 MHz) to capture and characterize these spikes. In parallel, the broader frequency coverage provided by the ASG receiver (650–20 MHz) is used to provide global spectral context and identify overall burst morphology. Additionally, CME information is derived from LASCO observations, and future work is mentioned for combining these data with imaging from the Nançay Radio Heliograph. Key observational events span from 2003 to 2011, with detailed event times provided for four key events.

### 2. Artemis-JLS/ASG Receiver on board the ARTEMIS-IV Solar Radio Spectrograph
- **General Comments**:
   - The ASG is a sweep frequency analyzer operating in parallel with the SAO receiver.
   - It covers a wider frequency range from 650 MHz down to 20 MHz in 630 channels with a cadence of 10 samples per second (approximately 100 ms time resolution).
   - It provides a broader spectral overview that includes both type II and accompanying type III and IV emissions.

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…ASG covering the 650-20 MHz range…”
