## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the rapid buildup of a magnetic flux rope (MFR) during a confined X2.2 class flare and its subsequent eruption during an X9.3 class flare in NOAA AR 12673 on 2017 September 6. The authors use a series of nonlinear force‐free field (NLFFF) extrapolations based on measured photospheric magnetic fields to study changes in the MFR-system’s axial flux, twist number, and magnetic helicity. Multi-wavelength observations are employed to capture both the on‐disk flare evolution and the coronal responses. The timing of the events is critical – with the confined flare occurring at SOL2017-09-06T08:57 UT and the eruptive flare at SOL2017-09-06T11:53 UT – in order to correlate the observed dynamics with the evolution of the MFR-system.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA is used to capture the on-disk evolution of the flares in multiple extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) passbands. It provides high-resolution images that reveal the structure of hot channels (HCs), flare ribbons, EUV dimmings, and other coronal features associated with the MFR-system.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Both analyzed ﬂares occurred near S09W33. Their on-disk evolution is captured by SDO/AIA (Pesnell et al. 2012).” 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the confined X2.2 flare
- **Time Range**: The confined flare began at SOL2017-09-06T08:57 UT (explicitly labeled as X2.2).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Here we present a buildup process of an MFR-system during a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T08:57)...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - 94 Å and 131 Å are mentioned as passbands showing the hot channels (HCs), which serve as proxies for the MFRs.
   - 1600 Å is used to capture flare ribbons.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Before both ﬂares, hot channels (HCs), which refer to the S-shaped structures appearing above the PILs in high-temperature AIA passbands (94 and 131 ˚A)... In both ﬂares, three ribbons (r1, r2 and r3 in Figure 2) appeared in 1600 ˚A passband.”
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Brightenings along the hot channels and ribbon evolution are used to assess the confined nature of the X2.2 flare, with no significant EUV dimmings observed.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For the X2.2 ﬂare, we do not ﬁnd EUV dimmings, separation of its ﬂare ribbons, or clear CME signatures, suggesting a conﬁned ﬂare.”
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - Snapshots from 94 Å (Figure 1c1–c5) document the evolution of the hot channel during the confined flare.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Observations of the eruptive X9.3 flare
- **Time Range**: The eruptive flare occurred at SOL2017-09-06T11:53 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...an MFR-system was located in the AR. During the conﬁned ﬂare... which erupted to a major CME accompanied by an X9.3 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T11:53) three hours later.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 94 Å continues to capture the hot channel eruption and subsequent evolution.
   - 1600 Å records the spatial separation of the flare ribbons.
   - 304 Å and 211 Å passbands are also noted; the 211 Å channel shows clear post-flare dimmings.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For the X9.3 ﬂare, clear on-disk eruption signs, EUV dimmings, separation of its ﬂare ribbons...”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The observable features include eruptive behavior manifested as ribbon separation and major CME signatures in the corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the accompanied bright, halo CME (Figure 2h) further confirmed the second ﬂare being eruptive.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Differences in morphology between the confined and eruptive flares are clearly highlighted by the EUV observations from AIA.

### 2. SOHO/LASCO on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/LASCO provides coronagraph observations that capture the outward moving coronal outflows (CME signatures) associated with the flares.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The associated coronal outﬂows are observed by SOHO/LASCO (Domingo et al. 1995).”
    
#### Data Collection Period 1: Coronal outflow during the confined flare
- **Time Range**: Approximately during the timing of the confined X2.2 flare (SOL2017-09-06T08:57 UT).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the associated faint and narrow coronal outﬂow (Figure 2d) might not be enough to be deﬁned as a CME.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in wavelength; LASCO observes in white light.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The instrument captured a faint and narrow coronal outflow which did not propagate extensively.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...did not propagate further than 10 R⊙, being clearly different from the major CME associated with the second ﬂare.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The weak outflow in this period supports the classification of the flare as confined.

#### Data Collection Period 2: CME observation during the eruptive flare
- **Time Range**: Corresponding with the eruptive X9.3 flare at SOL2017-09-06T11:53 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For the X9.3 ﬂare, clear on-disk eruption signs... and the accompanied major CME indicated an eruptive ﬂare.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: As with typical LASCO observations, the data are in white light.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - LASCO recorded a bright, halo CME.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The appeared bright, halo CME (Figure 2h) further conﬁrmed the second ﬂare being eruptive.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The dramatic difference in the corona between the first and second flares is clearly evidenced by LASCO observations.

### 3. SDO/HMI on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI is employed to obtain photospheric vector magnetic fields that serve as the bottom boundary for both NLFFF and potential field extrapolations. The study utilizes the SHARP magnetic-field data product.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds are recorded by SDO/HMI. Here a magnetic-field data product called SHARP (Bobra et al. 2014) is used.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - The HMI observations span the intervals before, during, and after both flares, providing the essential magnetic context for the eight instances (marked as 1–8 in Figure 1b) used in the analysis.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “To quantitatively study the properties of the MFR-system, we select eight instances (vertical-dashed lines in Figure 1b)... using SHARP magnetograms as the bottom boundaries.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not applicable; HMI observations are based on visible wavelengths for magnetic field measurements.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Measurement of the vector magnetic field (both vertical and horizontal components) which is used to reconstruct the three-dimensional coronal magnetic fields.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...and the associated extrapolations based on the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The precise magnetic measurements enable the identification and subsequent tracking of the MFR-system’s evolution across the flares.

### 4. GOES on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES monitors the soft X-ray flux of the Sun. Its data are crucial for timing the flares and for distinguishing the energy release phases of the confined and eruptive events.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 1b: GOES 1–8 ˚A ﬂux. The blue-dashed lines 1–8 indicate the instances used in Section 3.2.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: During the confined X2.2 flare**
- **Time Range**: The X2.2 flare is registered at SOL2017-09-06T08:57 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...a buildup process of an MFR-system during a conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T08:57)...”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 1–8 Å (soft X-ray band).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “GOES 1–8 ˚A ﬂux.”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Soft X-ray flux measurements indicating the intensity and temporal evolution of the flare.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The GOES soft X-ray flux is used to delineate the timing of the energy release in both the confined and eruptive flares.

#### Data Collection Period 2: During the eruptive X9.3 flare
- **Time Range**: The eruptive flare is registered at SOL2017-09-06T11:53 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...which erupted to a major CME accompanied by an X9.3 ﬂare (SOL2017-09-06T11:53)...”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 1–8 Å remains the observed band.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The enhancement in the soft X-ray flux corresponding to the eruptive X9.3 flare.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The distinction in GOES flux trends helps characterize the two different flare regimes (confined vs. eruptive).
