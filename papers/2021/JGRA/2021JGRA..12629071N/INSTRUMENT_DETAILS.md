## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the global ionospheric response during a sequence of high‐speed solar wind stream/corotating interaction region (HSS/CIR) events in the early solar minimum of 2007–2008. The study makes use of dual observational approaches. First, a network of ionosondes (measuring NmF2, the electron density peak, and hmF2, the F‐layer altitude) provided by NOAA–NCEI across 28 stations is analyzed over the period from December 1, 2007 to April 29, 2008 (with a few minor variations in start or end dates among some stations). Second, complementary solar wind and geomagnetic measurements are obtained from OMNI datasets, which include key observables such as the solar wind magnetic field (in particular the Bz component), speed (V), proton density (np) and geomagnetic indices (AE and SYM-H). The spectral analysis using the Lomb–Scargle method reveals distinct periodicities (27, 13.5, 9, and 6.75 days) which reflect the connection between solar wind forcing and the ionospheric response.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. NOAA–NCEI Ionosondes (Ionosonde NmF2 and hmF2 Measurements)
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments are part of a network of ionosondes whose data are publicly available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA–NCEI). They are used to probe the ionosphere by transmitting radio signals and recording the reflected echoes.
   - They measure the electron density peak (NmF2) and the F‐layer peak altitude (hmF2), which are key physical observables used to characterize the ionospheric response.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "The ionospheric response is studied using ionosonde NmF2 and hmF2 data publicly available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA – NCEI) website."
  
#### Data Collection Period: General Standard Period
- **Time Range**: December 01, 2007 – April 29, 2008  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "A total of 28 stations provided measurements for the period of interest (1 December 2007 – 30 April 2008)..."  
      - (Note: Although most stations cover this entire interval, a few stations have modified time ranges; for example, RL052, MU12K, and LV12P begin on December 25, 2007, and WP937 ends on January 07, 2008.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable  
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not explicitly provided in the text, as ionosondes operate by transmitting radio waves across a range of frequencies.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - NmF2: The maximum electron density in the F-layer.
   - hmF2: The corresponding altitude of the maximum electron density.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The ionospheric NmF2 and hmF2 spectra indicate that nonlinear interactions transfer power from the main spectral peaks to secondary ones."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The measurements are performed at 28 stations (listed in Table 1), and the ionosonde data are impacted by local conditions (e.g., magnetic latitude and weather), which in turn affect the dynamic range and sampling rates.
   - Specific examples include the RAL ionosonde (51.6° latitude, 358.7° longitude) and the Millstone Hill ionosonde (42.6° latitude, 288.5° longitude), as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.
   - Sampling frequencies vary among stations (e.g., 1/10 min at RAL, 1/7.5–1/15 min at Millstone Hill).

### 2. OMNI Dataset for Solar Wind and Geomagnetic Measurements
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI dataset provides measurements of the solar wind and geomagnetic activity, which serve as external drivers of the ionospheric variability. These data complements the ionosonde measurements by offering context for the observed spectral features.
   - Key parameters include the solar wind magnetic field (especially the Bz component), solar wind speed (V), and proton density (np), along with geomagnetic indices (AE and SYM-H) that quantify magnetospheric forcing.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "For this purpose, we used ionosonde NmF2 and hmF2 data ... as well as complementary OMNI datasets (King and Papitashvili, 2005) for solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices."
  
#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: December 01, 2007 – April 30, 2008  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "A total of 28 stations provided measurements for the period of interest (1 December 2007 – 30 April 2008)", indicating a similar observational window for the solar wind and geomagnetic parameters.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable  
   - **Supporting Quote**: The OMNI instrument measurements are based on plasma and magnetic field observations without reference to specific electromagnetic wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Solar Wind Parameters: Magnetic field (B with emphasis on Bz), solar wind speed (V), and proton density (np).
   - Geomagnetic Indices: Auroral AE, and equatorial SYM-H.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The spectral features in this case are the direct results of the presence of periodic CIR/HSS structures, and their magnetospheric impact."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The solar wind data are sampled at a rate of 1/min, contrasting with the varying sampling rates of the ionosonde data.
   - The comparison of spectral features between the OMNI dataset and the ionosonde data provides insights into the coupling mechanisms between the solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere.
