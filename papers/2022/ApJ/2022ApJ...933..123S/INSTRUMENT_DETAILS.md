## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the simulation of the 12 July 2012 Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) using a constant-turn flux rope model. The study aims to predict the CME's arrival time and magnetic field at Earth by constraining initial parameters with observational data. The research utilizes various models and observational data to simulate the CME's propagation through the inner heliosphere, comparing the results with in-situ measurements at Earth. The study also investigates the uncertainties in the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model parameters and their impact on CME forecasting.
