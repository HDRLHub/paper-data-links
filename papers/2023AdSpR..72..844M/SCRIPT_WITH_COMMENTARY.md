Note: This script assumes that the CALLISTO data is accessible through the Fido interface, which may not be the case. Researchers typically access CALLISTO data directly from the e-CALLISTO network's database or through specialized interfaces provided by the network. The script is structured to reflect the data used in the context, focusing on the specific time and frequency ranges mentioned for the observed radio bursts.
