## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of long‐period comets (LPCs) discovered from 1801 to 2017. The authors compile extensive data on cometary orbital elements, perihelion distances, and original semimajor axes in order to compare discovery circumstances between comets from the Oort spike and those on more tightly bound orbits. The work includes detailed investigations of how discovery distances, observing geometries (geocentric and heliocentric), and even potential non‐gravitational forces affect the observed population of LPCs. The paper relies on multiple archival data sources for comet orbits and utilizes observations predominantly from modern sky surveys, which have notably increased the discoveries of comets with large perihelion distances in recent decades.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO is cited as the operational instrument responsible for the discovery of the majority of sungrazing comets in the sample.
   - Its observations are crucial for detecting very small, rapidly evaporating comets (“sungrazers”) with extremely short data-arcs.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Most of the sungrazers were discovered by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) over the period of 1995–2008."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Discovery of Sungrazing Comets**
   - **Time Range**: 1995 – 2008
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Most of the sungrazers were discovered by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) over the period of 1995–2008."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the text.
      - **Supporting Quote**: No specific details on wavelengths are provided.
   - **Physical Observable**: Detection of faint, small-size sungrazers (comets with short data-arcs, typically only observable for 1–3 days).
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Due to extremely short data-arcs of sungrazers (typically 1–3 days) almost all their orbits are obtained with the assumption of e = 1."
   - **Additional Comments**: Although detailed information about specific detectors onboard SOHO is not provided, its role in increasing the sample of sungrazing comets is emphasized.

### 2. WISE/NEOWISE
- **General Comments**:
   - WISE/NEOWISE is mentioned as a source for “recent discoveries” that contribute to the understanding of the physical sizes of long-period comets.
   - The instrument’s observations have provided insights suggesting that LPCs are, on average, larger than short-period comets.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Recent WISE/NEOWISE discoveries (Bauer et al. 2015, 2017) suggest that the LPCs are on average almost twice as large as short period comets."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Recent Discoveries**
   - **Time Range**: The term "Recent" is used in the context of discoveries cited from Bauer et al. (2015, 2017). (No precise date range beyond these publication years is provided.)
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Recent WISE/NEOWISE discoveries (Bauer et al. 2015, 2017)..."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the text.
      - **Supporting Quote**: No information on wavelengths or specific detectors is provided.
   - **Physical Observable**: The observed physical sizes of LPCs.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "...suggest that the LPCs are on average almost twice as large as short period comets."
   - **Additional Comments**: Although detector specifics are not detailed, the contribution of WISE/NEOWISE in assessing the physical properties of comets is highlighted.

### 3. Pan-STARRS
- **General Comments**:
   - Pan-STARRS is referenced as the source of discovery for a comet designated "C/2017 Y2 PANSTARRS".
   - The instrument’s identification is used in the context of classifying an object that was later excluded from the LPC sample because it turned out to be a short-period comet.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Additionally, we excluded C/2017 Y2 PANSTARRS which turned out to be a short-period comet according to Minor Planet Center."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Discovery of C/2017 Y2**
   - **Time Range**: While the text does not specify a full observing campaign period, the comet's designation ("2017") implies that the discovery occurred in the year 2017.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "C/2017 Y2 PANSTARRS" (implies discovery in 2017).
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
      - **Supporting Quote**: The paper does not mention wavelengths or detailed detector characteristics for Pan-STARRS.
   - **Physical Observable**: The discovery was part of the broader survey aimed at detecting cometary objects; however, in this instance, the observable led to its reclassification as a short-period comet.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "...turned out to be a short-period comet according to Minor Planet Center."
   - **Additional Comments**: No further instrument-specific observational details (such as detector type or wavelength coverage) are provided regarding Pan-STARRS.
