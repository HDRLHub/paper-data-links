## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the magnetic fluxes of solar active regions (ARs) observed from May 12, 1996, to December 27, 2021. It utilizes data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) for observations before June 6, 2010, and from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for observations post this date. The study classifies ARs into various magneto-morphological classes and examines how their magnetic fluxes correlate with the solar cycle. The findings suggest that the magnetic flux contributions from different classes of ARs are synchronous with the solar cycle, with significant contributions from both regular and irregular ARs during solar maximums.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI was used to obtain full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms of the sun to study magnetic fluxes from solar active regions. It was specifically utilized for observations covering the 23rd solar cycle until June 6, 2010.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations covering the 23rd solar cycle until the transition to HMI
- **Time Range**: May 12, 1996 – June 6, 2010
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ni I 6768 Å spectral line
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic fluxes of solar active regions, specifically measuring the line-of-sight magnetic field component.
- **Additional Comments**: The data from MDI were used to calculate the total unsigned magnetic flux of ARs, considering a magnetic flux density threshold of 50 Mx cm^(-2).

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI continued the observations started by MDI on SOHO, focusing on the 24th solar cycle. It provided higher spatial resolution data and used a different spectral line.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations starting post-MDI for the 24th solar cycle
- **Time Range**: Post-June 6, 2010 – December 27, 2021
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173.3 Å spectral line
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic fluxes of solar active regions, specifically measuring the line-of-sight magnetic field component.
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data were processed to calculate the total unsigned magnetic flux of ARs with a lower magnetic flux density threshold of 18 Mx cm^(-2) compared to MDI. A correction coefficient of 1.23 was used to match the magnetic flux measurements from MDI for consistent analysis across solar cycles 23 and 24.
