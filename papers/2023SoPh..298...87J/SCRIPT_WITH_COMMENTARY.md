This script constructs and performs queries for SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI based on the specified parameters. It's important to note that for BBSO Hα data, one might need to access the BBSO data archives manually or through other specialized interfaces, as SunPy's Fido interface does not directly support BBSO data retrieval. The queries are structured to reflect the data used in the context, focusing on the time range, instrument, and physical observables or wavelengths as required.
