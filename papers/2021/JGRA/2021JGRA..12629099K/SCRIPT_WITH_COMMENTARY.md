This script uses SunPyâ€™s VSO interface via Fido to query two datasets as described in the scientific context:
1. Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) data between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010.
2. STEREO Ahead (STEREO A) data for a representative several-day interval during the period 2007-2010.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
- The script prints the query results.
- The Fido.fetch() commands are provided but commented out so that the script does not actually download data.
- Only the time range and instrument have been specified explicitly based on the provided context.
