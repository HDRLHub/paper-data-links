## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
This paper investigates a small-scale, short-duration solar eruption from NOAA AR 12445 on November 4, 2015. The study analyzes the event’s flare, CME hot channel, piston-driven shock, and associated metric type II radio burst. Data are directly acquired and analyzed from multiple observational instruments: SDO/AIA for EUV imaging and hot channel/coronal shock characteristics; SDO/HMI for photospheric vector magnetic fields; RHESSI for hard X-ray imaging and spectroscopy; GOES for soft X-ray flare lightcurves; SOHO/LASCO-C2 for white-light CME coronagraphy; and dynamic radio spectra from the Learmonth and Culgoora observatories for type II radio burst analysis. Data collection spans pre-event, impulsive, and main stages of the eruption, focusing particularly on 2015-11-04 between approximately 02:30 UT and 03:48 UT, with some mass calculation utilizing longer LASCO time series. Instrument data form the basis of all principal findings on CME kinematics, acceleration, energy partition, shock formation, and magnetic field diagnostics.
