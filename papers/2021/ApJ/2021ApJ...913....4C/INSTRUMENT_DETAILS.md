1. COR2 Coronagraph on board STEREO‑A  
   - General Comments:  
     - This white‑light coronagraph was used by DeForest et al. (2014) to detect inward propagating density fluctuations (plasma parcels) in polar coronal holes at heliocentric distances between approximately 7 and 12 R⊙.  
     - It is a visible‑light instrument that images the solar corona by recording scattered photospheric radiation.
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - The paper refers to an 11‑day series of COR2 observations analyzed by DeForest et al. (2014). (The text does not provide specific start and end UT dates but notes that these observations are confined to the period over which the deceleration trend between 7 and 12 R⊙ was measured.)
       - Supporting Quote: “For the 11 days of COR2 observations analyzed by DeForest et al. (2014)…”
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - Visible light (white‑light imaging via Thomson scattering of solar radiation).  
       - Supporting Quote: “…inflow signatures in visible‑light coronagraphy…” (context implies the use of white‑light scattered solar photons).  
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Inward plasma flows (density fluctuations) exhibiting deceleration as they propagate from around 12 R⊙ toward 7 R⊙.  
       - Supporting Quote: “...the observed deceleration trend of DeForest et al. (2014)…”

2. OMNI In Situ Data Collection (OMNIWeb Data Service)  
   - General Comments:  
     - This is a compilation of in situ measurements of solar wind parameters (e.g., plasma speed, density, and magnetic field) at 1 AU that was used to determine the properties of the solar wind near the Alfvén surface and to constrain model initial conditions.  
     - The OMNI data provided the statistical distribution of solar wind conditions that indirectly set constraints on the parcel’s initial speeds.
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - The analysis used a broad interval covering nearly a full solar cycle—from calendar years 2008 to 2018.
       - Supporting Quote: “...we chose to examine a full solar cycle’s worth of OMNI data at 1 AU (calendar years 2008–2018)...”
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - Not applicable; these are in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements (particle detectors and magnetometers) rather than remote‑sensing imaging in a particular wavelength band.
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Solar wind speed, density, and magnetic field properties, which contribute to the determination of the Alfvén speed and to mass-flux conservation estimates.  
       - Supporting Quote: “...the OMNI measurement of radial wind speed 1 AU can be used in combination with mass‑flux conservation to estimate the value of u…”

3. UVCS/SOHO (Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer on board SOHO)  
   - General Comments:  
     - UVCS/SOHO is referenced as providing Doppler-dimming wind‑speed measurements for comparison with the modeled solar wind speed profiles.  
     - Although not the primary instrument for the deceleration observations in this paper, its data serve as an independent benchmark.
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - The text does not provide specific time ranges for UVCS/SOHO observations within this paper.
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - Ultraviolet wavelengths (the instrument is designed to observe coronal emission lines in the UV).  
       - Supporting Quote: “For comparison, Doppler‑dimming wind‑speed measurements from UVCS/SOHO (Cranmer 2020a,b)…”
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Measurements of wind speeds derived from UV spectral line intensities (via Doppler dimming), which are characteristic of the acceleration region of the solar wind.

4. SOLIS Facility (Synoptic Optical Long‑term Investigations of the Sun)  
   - General Comments:  
     - SOLIS is mentioned as the facility used to obtain potential‑field extrapolation data from a near‑equatorial patch of the quiet Sun.
     - Its observations contributed to constructing model magnetic field maps for some of the ZEPHYR simulations referenced in the paper.
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - The observations used for the extrapolation were made in 2003.
       - Supporting Quote: “...from a near‑equatorial patch of quiet Sun observed by the Synoptic Optical Long‑term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) facility in 2003.”
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - Optical wavelengths; SOLIS is an optical facility primarily dedicated to synoptic measurements of the solar magnetic field and related observables.
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Magnetic field maps (used for potential‑field extrapolations) of the quiet Sun.
  
5. Hinode  
   - General Comments:  
     - Hinode is referenced in the discussion as having observed polar jets and small-scale dynamics in the corona.
     - Although not a main focus of the deceleration study, Hinode observations are mentioned in connection with similar phenomena (e.g., polar jets and network dynamics in coronal holes).
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - No specific time range is provided in the paper for Hinode observations.
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - Hinode carries instruments that observe in soft X‑rays and extreme‑ultraviolet (EUV); the context implies its use for imaging jets and dynamic coronal features.
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Jet activity, small‑scale dynamics, and transient brightenings associated with magnetic reconnection or other MHD phenomena.
       - Supporting Quote: “...phenomena such as polar jets seen above the limb with Hinode…”

6. PUNCH (Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere)  
   - General Comments:  
     - PUNCH is mentioned as an upcoming instrument (beginning in 2023) that will map low‑contrast motions in the corona and inner heliosphere.
     - It is anticipated to provide improved constraints on the dynamics and statistics of inflowing and outflowing plasma parcels.
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - Scheduled to begin operations in 2023; no detailed start‑end dates are provided.
       - Supporting Quote: “In 2023, the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) will begin mapping low‑contrast motions between 6 and 180 R⊙…”  
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - While not explicitly stated, PUNCH is expected to operate in the visible wavelength range, similar to other coronagraphic instruments.
   - Physical Observable:  
     - Low‑contrast coronal motions and dynamic structures spanning a large range of heliocentric distances (6–180 R⊙), which include both inflows and outflows in the solar wind.
