produce the script. We need to construct queries for the HÎ± Lyot Filtergraph and the Vector Magnetograph on the Domeless Solar Telescope (DST) for specific dates and times as mentioned in the context. Since the DST and its instruments are not standard entries in the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) used by SunPy's Fido interface, we will simulate the query process assuming these instruments were available. The script will reflect the specific time ranges, wavelengths, and physical observables as detailed in the context.
