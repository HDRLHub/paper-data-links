## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper outlines a roadmap for low radio frequency observations from the Moon. It describes both heritage and new lunar instruments, emphasizing proof‐of‐concept experiments on landed payload missions and planning for future large radio arrays. The discussed instruments—ranging from historical spaceborne experiments to upcoming lunar surface assets—span a broad frequency range from ≈10 kHz up to tens of MHz. Specific time ranges are provided for past missions (e.g., RAE‑2 operating from 1973–1975) as well as planned lunar experiments (e.g., ROLSES scheduled for late 2021 with a 14‐day operational period, LuSEE expected to launch in Q4 2024, and FARSIDE planned for a five‑year operation later in this decade). Each instrument uses its own detector types including electrically‑short deployable antennas (STACER technology), radio spectrometers, and a suite of plasma and magnetic field sensors to achieve its science goals.
