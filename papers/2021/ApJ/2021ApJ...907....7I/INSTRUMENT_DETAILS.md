## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study reports on simultaneous observations of the magnetar 1E 1547.0–5408 during its 2009 bursting phase using both X-ray and radio instruments. The observations, performed on January 23, January 25, and February 3–4, 2009, were designed to capture detailed burst phenomena and pulsations from the magnetar. X-ray data were obtained with Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift BAT, and Konus‐Wind, covering energy ranges typically from 0.3 keV up to several MeV. Radio observations were conducted with the Parkes 64‐m telescope using both digital (DFB3) and analogue (AFB) filterbank backends, at central frequencies ranging approximately from 2.9 to 6.6 GHz. The multiwavelength approach allowed the authors to compare the timings, spectral properties, and morphology of X-ray bursts and radio pulses – a key to understanding the connection between magnetar bursts and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).

### 2. XMM-Newton – EPIC Cameras (pn and MOS)
- **General Comments**:
   - XMM-Newton equipped with multiple European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC) was used to observe across the soft X-ray regime. Both the EPIC-pn (with 73.4 ms frame time) and the MOS cameras (with 2.6 s frame time) contributed data to study the bursts and the persistent emission.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On 2009 February 3–4, 1E 1547.0–5408 was observed with XMM-Newton with all EPIC cameras operating in Full Frame mode (frame time of 73.4 ms and 2.6 s, for the pn and MOS, respectively)."

- **Data Collection Period 1: February 3–4, 2009 Observation**
   - **Time Range**: Start at 18:28:58 UT on February 3, 2009; observation lasted approximately 1.5 hours as per Table 1.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "For the third observation on February 3rd ... data were collected for 1.5 hr beginning at 18:28:58."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Energy coverage from 0.3–10 keV.

### 3. Swift – Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
- **General Comments**:
   - BAT is a coded-mask instrument designed for the detection of transient events in the hard X-ray band. Although its primary role is to promptly identify gamma-ray bursts, in this study it provided timing information when a significant count rate increase was detected coincident with KW trigger.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At the same epoch also the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift ... detected a significant count rate increase coincident in time (and shape) with the KW trigger."

- **Data Collection Period 1: 2009 February 3 Burst Event**
   - **Time Range**: The BAT detection coincides with the burst event around 19:31:28.66 TDB on February 3, 2009.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Burst '2' was also seen by Swift BAT ... provided us with an accurate peak barycentred time of 19:31:28.66 TDB."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Operates in the 15–150 keV band.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "BAT is a coded-mask instrument operating in the 15-150 keV band..."
   - **Physical Observable**: Variations in the hard X-ray count rate, used primarily for timing rather than spectral analysis in this event.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "No spectral information can be obtained in such cases and only timing information are recorded."
   - **Additional Comments**: Although the source was outside the nominal field of view (FoV), BAT still recorded the burst timing, contributing to the cross-instrument correlation.

### 4. Konus-Wind (KW)
- **General Comments**:
   - Konus-Wind is equipped with two identical NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors covering a wide energy range from 20 keV to 16 MeV. It is designed to trigger on bursts when the count rate exceeds a high statistical threshold, providing precise timing and high temporal resolution (down to 2 ms).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "KW consists of two identical NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors... operating from 20 keV to 16 MeV." and "Burst '2' triggered KW at T0, KW = 19:31:28.646 TDB (with an accuracy of few ms)."

- **Data Collection Period 1: 2009 February 3 Burst Event**
   - **Time Range**: Burst triggered at T0 = 19:31:28.646 TDB on February 3, 2009.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Burst '2' triggered KW at T0, KW = 19:31:28.646 TDB..."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 20 keV to 16 MeV, with spectral information derived in the 20–300 keV band.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "This spectrum contains 400 background-subtracted counts in the 20–300 keV energy band."
   - **Physical Observable**: High-energy burst counts and spectral hardness, which were compared directly with properties of SGR bursts.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "We obtained a good ﬁt ... by applying to the model of the KW spectrum a cross-normalization factor..."
   - **Additional Comments**: KW’s high time resolution (2 ms in triggered mode) provided critical timing constraints for aligning the X-ray and radio burst profiles.

   - **Time Range**: Start at 16:48:22 UT on January 25, 2009, with overlap with simultaneous X-ray data.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "On January 25, in parallel with the DFB3, we also acquired data with the analogue ﬁlterbank AFB in search mode..."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Two setups were used:
      - DFB3: Noted with the same configuration as in the January 23 session.
      - AFB: Observing at a central frequency of ∼2.9 GHz over a total bandwidth of 576 MHz with 3-MHz wide channels.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "AFB data were 1-bit digitized every 1 ms, while DFB3 data... providing total overlap with X-ray data."
   - **Physical Observable**: Radio pulsations – the paper discusses changes in pulse profile and pulsed fraction compared to earlier observations.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The pulse shape and the pulsed fraction changed significantly... from an almost sinusoidal to a double-peaked pulse profile."

   - **Wavelength(s)**: Two setups were used:
      - DFB3: 0.5-MHz-wide channels covering a total bandwidth of 256 MHz centered at 6.4 GHz.
      - AFB: 3-MHz-wide channels covering a total bandwidth of 576 MHz.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "Data were collected simultaneously with the AFB using 3-MHz-wide channels covering a total bandwidth of 576 MHz and with the DFB3 using 0.5-MHz-wide channels and a total bandwidth of 256 MHz..."
   - **Physical Observable**: Single radio pulses/bursts (pulse A and pulse B) were detected at epochs 19:31:29.82 TDB and 19:31:34.05 TDB respectively. Notably, one pulse saturated the backend for about 0.2 s.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "In the third observation on February 3rd, no pulsations were detected, but only two single pulses/bursts were observed, at epochs 19:31:29.82 (pulse A) and 19:31:34.05 (pulse B) TDB."
   - **Additional Comments**: The high time resolution and sensitivity allowed measurement of pulse fluence (e.g., pulse A had an estimated fluence of ∼0.6 kJy ms) and provided essential timing alignment with X-ray burst data.
