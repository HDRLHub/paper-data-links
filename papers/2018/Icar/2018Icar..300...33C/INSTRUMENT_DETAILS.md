## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents water production rates for nine long‐period (and a few dynamically new) comets as observed via hydrogen Lyman‑α emission. The primary data source consists of full‐sky images obtained by the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft over multiple comet apparitions during 2013–2016. For each comet the observed water production is modeled as a function of heliocentric distance (with separate pre‑ and post‑perihelion behavior) and compared with complementary observations from other instruments (e.g., ground‑based OH measurements, infrared observations, and radio detections). The paper details the observational time ranges for each comet (e.g., from April to December 2014 for C/2012 K1, and similar well‐defined periods for the others) and makes comparisons with datasets obtained by Swift/UVOT, IRAM, NIRSPEC, the Giano spectrograph on TNG, TRAPPIST, the Nançay radio telescope, and the Odin satellite.
