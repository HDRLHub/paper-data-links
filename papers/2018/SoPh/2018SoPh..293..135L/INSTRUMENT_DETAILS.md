# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of magnetic clouds (MCs) and the southward Bz components in their sheath regions over an extended period. Data spanning from 1995 to 2017 at the L1 point and from multiple vantage points using the STEREO twin spacecraft (as well as additional supporting remote-sensing data) are studied to understand the solar-cycle dependence of MC properties and their geomagnetic impacts. The research uses a variety of instruments that measure in-situ solar-wind plasma, interplanetary magnetic field and remote solar images, thereby linking solar sources such as active-region flares, filament eruptions, and EUV dimmings to the observed MC events at 1 AU. Specific time ranges are assigned to each instrument depending on the observation period and data availability.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. ACE Instruments on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - ACE, located at the L1 point, provided continuous high-quality in-situ measurements of the solar wind plasma and interplanetary magnetic field. This includes data on magnetic field strength and orientation (via MAG) as well as key plasma parameters like proton temperature, density, and bulk speed (via SWEPAM). The study uses these measurements extensively to identify and analyze 303 MCs over two solar cycles (1995–2017).

- **General Comments**:
   - The STEREO twin spacecraft provide in-situ solar wind and IMF measurements, offering additional independent observation points near 1 AU.

   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "We have identified 67 bipolar MCs at STEREO-A and -B during the years 2007 to 2013 due to data availability and continuity issues in and after 2014."

- **Additional Comments**: 
   - In addition to continuous observations during 2007–2013, STEREO-A provided further observations in 2016 and 2017.
   
#### Data Collection Period 2: Extended Observations (STEREO-A only)
- **Time Range**: 2016 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "We have also identified eight bipolar MCs at STEREO-A in the years 2016 and 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Same as above – in-situ measurements of the magnetic field and plasma properties.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These additional observations helped extend the record of MC polarity and provided further data continuity at 1 AU.

### 3. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SDO/AIA instrument provides high-cadence, high-resolution full disk images of the Sun in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. This allows improved identification and tracking of CMEs and the associated solar sources (including filaments and flares) that give rise to magnetic clouds.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "In 2010, the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provided the community with Earth-view full disk images in higher cadence and resolution, and excellent quality."
- **Data Collection Period**: Post-2010 
   - **Time Range**: Starting 2010 onward (specific observations for MC source identification are considered from 2010 as part of the multi-perspective approach)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not explicitly stated as a range, but implied by the launch in 2010 and subsequent usage.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
   - **Supporting Quote**: While the detailed wavelengths are not listed, SDO/AIA is known for its EUV imaging.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Solar disk images used to identify coronal mass ejection (CME) source regions including flares, filament eruptions, and EUV dimmings.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "we utilized the images and movies from ... SDO/AIA imaging data“ provided by SDO.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA plays a key role in linking in-situ MC events with their solar sources, offering complementary information to the in-situ measurements.

### 4. LASCO on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO coronagraph on SOHO provides images of the corona and is instrumental in identifying and cataloguing CMEs. These data support the association of remote-sensed CME events with the in-situ MC observations at 1 AU.

   - "we utilized the images and movies from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) CME catalog... generated and maintained at the CDAW Data Center by NASA and The Catholic University of America..."
- **Data Collection Period**: While no explicit dates for LASCO usage are provided, LASCO data are used to search for CME events occurring within five days prior to MC arrival.
   - **Time Range**: The CME search window is "five days prior to the MC arrival" for events observed during the study period (1995–2017 for L1 events).

### 5. GOES Soft X-ray Instruments on board GOES Satellites
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES soft X-ray instruments are used for monitoring and identifying solar flares. The occurrence of a flare (with intensity typically greater than about B8.0) is used as a key signature to classify a magnetic cloud’s (MC’s) solar source.

   - "When an MC event is marked with a flare source, for example a GOES soft X-ray flare is recorded greater than ≈B8.0 from an active region..."
- **Data Collection Period**: No specific date range is provided; rather, GOES observations are integrated with CME and MC analysis during the overall study period.
   - **Time Range**: Implicitly covers the active period of solar events associated with the paper’s study (e.g., within 2007–2017 and earlier as required for flare identification).
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-rays (typically in the range of 1–8 Å for GOES X-ray measurements)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not detailed in the text beyond "soft X-ray flare".
