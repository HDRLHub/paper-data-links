# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a multipoint study of four successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that erupted between 21 and 23 May 2013. It combines multiwavelength remote‑sensing observations (in EUV, white‑light, and radio) with in‑situ measurements and 3D heliospheric modeling in order to trace the evolution of the events from the low corona out into interplanetary space. The study makes use of observations from several spacecraft (PROBA2, SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and Wind) as well as ground‑based radio facilities (NDA and NRH) to examine the CME structure, propagation, radio shock signatures, and eventual impact at 1 AU.
