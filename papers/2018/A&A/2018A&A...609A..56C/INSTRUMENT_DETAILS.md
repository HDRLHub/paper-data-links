## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper "Observing and modeling the poloidal and toroidal fields of the solar dynamo" presents an observational and modeling study of the large-scale poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields associated with the solar dynamo. The study focuses on using synoptic maps and full-disk magnetograms to derive and analyze the longitudinally-averaged radial (poloidal) and azimuthal (toroidal) components of the Sun's surface magnetic field over approximately four solar cycles, spanning from the late 1970s through 2017. The key primary data sources for these analyses are the KPNSO/VT and SOLIS synoptic observations for the poloidal fields, and the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) and SOHO/MDI full-disk magnetograms for the toroidal fields. The research aims to relate these measured quantities to those predicted by Babcock-Leighton-type solar dynamo models, with explicit comparative time-latitude mapping over multi-decade periods, and with a breakdown of data collection methods, time frames, and instrumental specifics.

### Vector Magnetograph (VT) on board KPNSO, and SOLIS Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) at NSO

- **General Comments**:
  - These instruments provided synoptic maps of the solar surface radial magnetic field, forming the basis to construct the poloidal field as a function of time and latitude over the timespan from 1976 to 2017. Both data sets were used to produce longitude-averaged, time-latitude “butterfly diagrams” of the surface radial field for four solar cycles.

  "We use synoptic maps of the surface radial field from the KPNSO/VT and SOLIS observatories to construct the poloidal field as a function of time and latitude..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-term synoptic mapping of surface radial field for poloidal field analysis
- **Time Range**: 1976 – 2017 (covering nearly four activity cycles; specific context: poloidal field evolution from late Cycle 20 through early Cycle 24)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the observable that corresponds to the relevant poloidal field of the global dynamo is the longitudinally averaged radial field at the solar surface (Cameron & Schüssler 2015), for which we have four activity cycles of observations, presented in the form of a time-latitude magnetic butterfly map (Hathaway 2015)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified for these instruments in this paper
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    [No explicit wavelength quote found for KPNSO/VT and SOLIS in this manuscript.]
- **Physical Observable**: Longitudinally-averaged surface radial magnetic field (proxy for global poloidal field)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the observable that corresponds to the relevant poloidal field of the global dynamo is the longitudinally averaged radial field at the solar surface (Cameron & Schüssler 2015)..."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - These data sets facilitated the mapping of polar field reversals, spatiotemporal field evolution, and the construction of time-latitude diagrams used for both empirical analysis and model validation.

### Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) Full-Disk Magnetograph

- **General Comments**:
  - WSO provided full-disk, daily line-of-sight magnetograms, which were then used to derive yearly averaged, longitudinally-averaged surface azimuthal (toroidal) field maps. The data set covers multiple decades and forms one of the cornerstones in analyzing the evolution of global toroidal flux at the photosphere.

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We determined the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field using the technique described in Duvall (1978) and Duvall et al. (1979) applied to WSO and SOHO/MDI observations..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Yearly averaged magnetograms for azimuthal (toroidal) field derivation
- **Time Range**: 1976 – 2017 (covering more than four cycles, including full context of high- and low-latitude azimuthal field evolution)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We determined the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field using ...WSO and SOHO/MDI observations."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified for WSO in this paper  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    [No explicit wavelength quote found for WSO in this manuscript.]
- **Physical Observable**: Longitudinally-averaged surface azimuthal (toroidal) magnetic field, derived from line-of-sight photospheric magnetic measurements
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The observable that corresponds to the relevant toroidal field for the solar dynamo is the subsurface longitudinally averaged azimuthal field, which we can only detect when it emerges through the surface...The surface longitudinally averaged azimuthal field determined from MDI (blue) and Wilcox Solar Observatory (red)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - WSO data provided a long-term, continuous record crucial for high-latitude (>50°) toroidal field trend analysis, time-lag comparisons with polar fields, and validation with independent data sources.

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - MDI data were used primarily to supplement and cross-validate WSO findings, especially for the period during which both instruments overlapped. The MDI full-disk daily magnetograms were processed for yearly averages, corrected for B-angle variations, and then analyzed via the same symmetry technique for azimuthal surface field derivation.

- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We determined the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field using the technique described in Duvall (1978) and Duvall et al. (1979) applied to WSO and SOHO/MDI observations. In brief, the technique first creates a 'very-deep' line-of-sight magnetogram consisting of a yearly average of the line-of-sight magnetic field on the solar disk (for the SOHO/MDI data, with each day being first remapped to account for B-angle variations)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Yearly remapped magnetograms for toroidal field analysis
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2011 (full MDI operational period, with focus on coeval period with WSO for consistency and instrument cross-comparison)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We determined the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field using the technique described in Duvall (1978) and Duvall et al. (1979) applied to WSO and SOHO/MDI observations."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified for MDI in this paper
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    [No explicit wavelength quote found for SOHO/MDI in this manuscript.]
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field; processed to obtain longitudinally-averaged surface azimuthal (toroidal) field
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the technique first creates a 'very-deep' line-of-sight magnetogram consisting of a yearly average of the line-of-sight magnetic field on the solar disk (for the SOHO/MDI data, with each day being first remapped to account for B-angle variations). This average magnetogram is split into a component that is symmetric with respect to the solar meridian, and a component that is anti-symmetric. ... the anti-symmetric component ... at any latitude is proportional to the yearly and longitudinally averaged azimuthal field..."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The MDI data's higher spatial resolution compared to WSO allowed analysis of finer-scale surface field structures. Discrepancies between MDI and WSO results were noted and attributed primarily to differences in spatial resolution and sensitivity.
