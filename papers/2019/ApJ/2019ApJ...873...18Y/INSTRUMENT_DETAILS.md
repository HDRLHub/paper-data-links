## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper focuses on constructing rotating solar models with low metal abundances and investigating whether, with the inclusion of enhanced settling and convection overshoot, such models can reproduce key seismically inferred solar parameters (such as the depth of the convection zone, surface helium abundance, and sound-speed/density profiles) as well as the standard solar models built with high metal abundances. The work compares model predictions to helioseismic observations and neutrino flux measurements, using data from several solar observational instruments. Although the paper primarily discusses model parameters and comparisons, it incorporates observational constraints from multiple helioseismic instruments and detectors when comparing its computed sound-speed and density profiles and oscillation frequency separations with the Sun.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network
- **General Comments**:
   - A ground‐based network providing helioseismic data used to infer the solar sound-speed and density profiles.
   - The data obtained from this network serve as a reference to compare computed solar model profiles.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...the sound speed and density of our models were compared with those inferred by Basu et al. (2009) using the data from the Birmingham Solar‐Oscillations Network (Chaplin et al. 1996) and the Michelson Doppler Imager (Schou et al. 1998).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Helioseismic Sound-Speed and Density Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...using the data from the Birmingham Solar‐Oscillations Network (Chaplin et al. 1996)...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (No specific wavelength information is given in the context.)

   - **Additional Comments**: The network’s observations are used indirectly via literature (Chaplin et al. 1996) to compare the model output with seismically inferred values.

### 2. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - An instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) that provides doppler imaging of the Sun.
   - MDI measurements of solar oscillations are used to infer internal solar parameters (sound speed and density) to constrain solar models.

      - **Supporting Quote**: “...using the data from ... the Michelson Doppler Imager (Schou et al. 1998).”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: No specific wavelengths are mentioned.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (No wavelength details available in the context.)
   - **Physical Observable**: Doppler shifts corresponding to solar oscillations, which are used to derive sound-speed and density profiles.

   - **Additional Comments**: Although the period of data collection is not given, the instrument’s role in helioseismology is crucial for validating solar interior models.

### 3. GOLF & VIRGO Instruments on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments on the SOHO spacecraft measure solar oscillations. GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) and VIRGO (Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations) together provide high-quality frequency datasets.
   - Their observations are used in calculating frequency separation ratios (r02 and r13), which are key helioseismic diagnostics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Figure 2 shows that the ratios of small to large separations, r02 and r13, of our SSMs agree with those calculated from observed frequencies of Chaplin et al. (1999) or Garc´ıa et al. (2011).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Helioseismic Frequency Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the circles and triangles show the ratios calculated from observed frequencies of GOLF & VIRGO (Garc´ıa et al. 2011)...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not provided.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (No wavelength information is mentioned in the context.)
   - **Physical Observable**: Solar oscillation frequencies used to determine ratios of small to large separations (r02 and r13), which inform on the solar internal structure.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the ratios of small to large separations, r02 and r13...”
   - **Additional Comments**: No explicit observational time range is cited, though these instruments are known to have provided long-term continuous observations.

### 4. Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON)
- **General Comments**:
   - BiSON is a ground-based network that collects solar oscillation data for helioseismic studies.
   - Its data are employed in calculating frequency separation ratios (r02 and r13), providing an independent dataset from space-based instruments.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...or the ratios calculated from observed frequencies of... BiSON (Chaplin et al. 1999).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Helioseismic Frequency Measurements**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the triangles show the ratios calculated from observed frequencies of... BiSON (Chaplin et al. 1999).”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (No details on wavelengths are provided in the context.)
   - **Physical Observable**: Measurements of solar oscillation frequencies that are used to derive the small-to-large frequency separation ratios (r02 and r13).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 2 shows that the ratios of small to large separations, r02 and r13...”
   - **Additional Comments**: Similar to the other instruments, the paper does not provide explicit start and end dates for BiSON observations but uses its published results to benchmark solar model predictions.
