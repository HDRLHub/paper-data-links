## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the occurrence of type II solar radio bursts and their association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles 23 and 24. The study aims to understand the dynamics and energetics of CMEs through the analysis of type II bursts, which are believed to be signatures of shock-accelerated electrons in the solar corona. The authors performed a statistical analysis of type II bursts that occurred between 200 - 25 MHz, categorizing CMEs based on their speed and angular width. The data spans from January 1996 to December 2019, covering both solar cycles, and reveals that a significant percentage of type II bursts are associated with CMEs, with varying relationships across the two cycles.
