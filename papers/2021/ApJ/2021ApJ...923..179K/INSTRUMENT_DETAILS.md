## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper compares two global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere – the BU (also known as SHIELD) model and the Moscow model – which employ different numerical approaches and physical assumptions, particularly regarding magnetic reconnection. Both models use identical boundary conditions for the solar wind and interstellar medium, with inner boundary conditions derived from 22-year averaged solar cycle data (1995–2017) and outer boundary conditions for protons and neutral hydrogen. Observational inputs from several instruments are incorporated to define these boundary conditions and to help benchmark the models. In addition, comparisons are made with in situ data (Voyager 1 & 2) and potential Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). These instruments contribute essential physical observables such as solar wind density, speed, backscattered Lyman‑alpha intensity, and magnetic field properties.

### 1. OMNI 2 Dataset
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI 2 dataset is used to supply hourly-averaged solar wind measurements (density and speed) in the ecliptic plane. This dataset is a composite of in situ solar wind measurements from multiple spacecraft and is critical for establishing the inner boundary conditions in both heliospheric models.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "In the ecliptic plane, hourly-averaged solar wind data from the OMNI 2 dataset is used for the density and speed."

### 2. SOHO/SWAN Instrument
- **General Comments**:
   - The SOHO/SWAN instrument provides full-sky maps of backscattered Lyman‑alpha intensities. These measurements are used to derive the heliolatitudinal variations of the solar wind mass flux, which is an essential element in setting the inner boundary conditions of both heliospheric models.

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "…an inversion procedure is used to obtain solar wind mass ﬂux as a function of time and heliolatitude."
- **Additional Comments**: The SOHO/SWAN data allow for a mapping of solar wind mass flux variations with heliolatitude, which is critical for realistic modeling of the heliosphere’s inner boundary conditions.

### 3. Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) is mentioned as a future observational tool that could potentially detect the differences in energetic neutral atom (ENA) signatures produced by the differing heliospheric structures predicted by the BU and Moscow models.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "These diﬀerences in the two plasma solutions may manifest themselves in energetic neutral atom measurements of the heliosphere… These diﬀerences are potentially observable by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer."
   
#### Data Collection Period: Not Specified
- **Time Range**: Not specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not provided.

   - **Supporting Quote**: Not provided.
- **Physical Observable**: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) signatures resulting from the heliosphere–ISM interaction
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "…yield diﬀerent ENA signatures at diﬀerent energy bands."
- **Additional Comments**: IBEX represents a promising means to bridge the gap between model predictions and actual observations by directly measuring the ENA emissions from the heliospheric boundaries.
