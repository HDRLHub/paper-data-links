## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This review paper investigates the physical nature of large-scale, globally propagating coronal EUV (“EIT”) waves, assessing competing theories based on quantifiable properties derived from available observations. The research is based on the synthesis and analysis of previously published results as well as new measurement approaches, particularly utilizing high-cadence imaging and spectroscopic observations from modern solar observatories. The principal data sources forming the backbone of property evaluation are EUV imaging from SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI, and SDO/AIA, as well as limited spectroscopic observations from Hinode/EIS and radio dynamic spectra (occasionally spatially resolved) from ground-based observatories such as the Nançay Radioheliograph. The study reviews observational periods spanning 1997–2013, with specific events uniquely examined using multiple instruments (e.g., 12 May 1997, 19 May 2007, 13 February 2009, and 15 February 2011). Analyses include imaging in various EUV passbands (primarily 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å), DEM analyses, spectroscopic slit scans, and radio dynamic spectra, all of which underpin the scrutiny of kinematic, geometric, and physical properties of EIT waves central to the paper's conclusions.

### Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/EIT was fundamental for the initial discovery and extensive cataloging of “EIT waves,” providing EUV imaging data that informed many statistical and event-based analyses within this review. Although limited by cadence (12–15 minutes) and spatial resolution (~5″), EIT observations are the foundation for historical context and property statistics.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Globally propagating waves in the solar corona have been studied in detail since being ﬁrst directly observed by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudinière et al., 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995)."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: EIT-wave discovery, statistical event cataloging, and event studies (1997–2013)
- **Time Range**: 1997 – 2013, encompassing major EIT wave event observations and catalogs  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "...between 1997 and 2013 at least 407 events have been identiﬁed using the SOHO, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO: Kaiser et al., 2008) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012) spacecraft (cf. Thompson and Myers, 2009; Nitta et al., 2013; Muhr et al., 2014)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å EUV channel (Fe XII), primary for wave detection  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The majority of the theories designed to explain this phenomenon were originally proposed based on observations from SOHO/EIT that had a spatial and temporal sampling of ≈5″ and 12 – 15 minutes, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Globally propagating bright coronal pulses (“EIT waves”)—kinematics, intensity variation, and morphology  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "“EIT waves” are generally observed as bright pulses in the low solar corona emanating from the source of a solar eruption, and often traverse the solar disk in less than an hour."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - This instrument provides the reference baseline for nearly all subsequent EIT wave studies and forms the statistical framework of the review.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
  - STEREO/EUVI supplies critical dual-viewpoint EUV imaging data with improved cadence and spatial resolution over SOHO/EIT, enabling 3D structure analysis, geometric property measurement, and wave-CME relationship studies for key events and statistical surveys.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "However, this was improved on by the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI: Wuelser et al., 2004) onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft (≈3.2″ and 1.25 – 10 minutes)..."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Multipoint event tracking and geometric studies (2007–2013, with focus on events post-STEREO launch)
- **Time Range**: Post-October 2006 (STEREO launch) through at least 2013 for global event studies and specific events  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "...the launches of STEREO and SDO have led to more statistical “EIT wave” studies using the analysis techniques developed for individual events, but these have focused on individual properties such as kinematics and wave-pulse characteristics (e.g. Thompson and Myers, 2009; Warmuth and Mann, 2011; Nitta et al., 2013; Muhr et al., 2014)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å, 171 Å (and other EUVI EUV channels as applicable)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The optimal temporal step for estimating kinematics and properties of an 'EIT wave' must therefore be chosen carefully. The temporal step must be large enough that the positions of the pulse do not overlap in the two images, as this leads to incorrect estimation of pulse properties such as width and peak intensity difference (or intensity ratio)..."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV coronal bright fronts (EIT waves), CME kinematics, geometric properties (height, dome-shape), multiperspective morphology  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Multi-point observations from the STEREO spacecraft provide better insight into the relation between “EIT waves” and CMEs, while the improved temporal/spatial capabilities of SDO/AIA could supply suﬃcient evidence of the physical processes at work."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Enables crucial 3D measurements in combination with SDO/AIA for events such as 13 February 2009, among others.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/AIA is the principal source for recent, high-cadence, high-resolution coronal EUV imaging, allowing for detailed study of EIT wave pulse kinematics, thermal diagnostics using multiple channels, and DEM analyses.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "and more recently the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) onboard SDO (≈1.2″ and 12 seconds)."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: High cadence EUV wave analyses and thermal diagnostics (Post-February 2010 to at least 2015)
- **Time Range**: From 2010-02 (SDO launch) to at least 2015 for detailed coronal wave studies and DEM analyses  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Kozarev et al. (2011) used DEM analysis of a limb eruption on 13 June 2011 to ﬁnd a density increase of 12 %, while Vanninathan et al. (2015) used a similar approach for an on-disk event on 15 February 2011."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, and additional EUV passbands as necessary for DEM  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "As described by Downs et al. (2012), the 171 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å passbands may be combined and used to indicate changes in the temperature of the plasma during the passage of an “EIT wave”."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal EUV waves—kinematics, intensity, thermal structure from multi-channel imaging, temperature and density variations via DEM  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Using the regularized-inversion technique of Hannah and Kontar (2012, 2013), they found a density increase of 6 – 9 %, corresponding to a temperature increase of ≈5 – 6 % during the “EIT wave” passage, which was shown to be a result of adiabatic compression at the wave front."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - High cadence and multiple wavelengths allow pulse broadening, adiabatic heating, and other subtle properties to be quantified for events such as 13 June 2011 and 15 February 2011.

### Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
  - Hinode/EIS provides high-spectral resolution slit spectroscopy in the EUV, facilitating line-based diagnostics of velocity, temperature, and density perturbations associated with EIT wave passages.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The alternative to this is provided by slit spectrometers such as the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS: Culhane et al., 2007) onboard the Hinode spacecraft (Kosugi et al., 2007). EIS has very high spectral resolution from a 1 – 2′′-wide slit that provides an opportunity to identify up-/down-ﬂows associated with the passage of the pulse."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Targeted slit scans simultaneous with EUV wave passages (15 February 2011 and others)
- **Time Range**: Events with coordinated EIS rasters, e.g., SOL2011-02-15, and two at least observed EIT waves  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Despite this, EIS has observed at least two events, both of which have been extensively studied (cf. Harra et al., 2011; Veronig et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Long et al., 2013)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV lines supported by EIS, including (but not limited to) Fe XII, Fe XIV (depends on study specifics)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "EIS has very high spectral resolution from a 1 – 2′′-wide slit that provides an opportunity to identify up-/down-ﬂows associated with the passage of the pulse."
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight upflows/downflows, temperature and density perturbations associated with EIT wave front  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Spectroscopic observations show downﬂows of up to 20 km s−1 at the “EIT wave” front (Harra et al., 2011; Veronig et al., 2011), indicative of downward plasma motion related to compression and inconsistent with continuous reconnection."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - EIS coverage is rare due to limited field-of-view and requires fortuitous alignment with wave propagation paths.

### Ground-based and Space-based Radio Instrumentation (Dynamic Spectra and Radio Imaging)
- **General Comments**:
  - Dynamic radio spectra from various ground-based instruments and rare radio imaging (notably the Nançay Radioheliograph) are used to identify and locate Type II radio bursts as proxies for coronal shock signatures associated with EIT waves.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The primary signatures used to indicate the presence of a shock wave are Type II radio bursts (e.g. Klein et al., 1999; Mann, 1995b; Mann and Classen, 1995). Dynamic radio spectra are suﬃcient to identify the existence of a shock wave and potentially its height (inferred from a density model or estimate), but they do not identify the spatial location of the shock. However, this can be achieved occasionally using radio imaging observations from, e.g., the Nançay Radioheliograph."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: EIT wave–associated Type II shock tracking (multiple events between 1998–2013)
- **Time Range**: Selected events with simultaneous radio dynamic spectra and/or imaging; e.g., 2 May 1998, 3 November 2003, 13 June 2011, and others as listed in cited studies  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "This facility was used by Pohjolainen et al. (2001), Khan and Aurass (2002), Vrˇsnak et al. (2005, 2006), and Carley et al. (2013) to identify and track Type II radio emission associated with “EIT waves”, complemented by dynamic spectra from multiple instruments to study the associated shock-accelerated particle emission."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Metric to decametric radio wavelengths, typical for Type II (frequency range not precisely specified in this paper)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Dynamic radio spectra are suﬃcient to identify the existence of a shock wave and potentially its height (inferred from a density model or estimate), but they do not identify the spatial location of the shock."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal shock diagnostic via Type II radio burst occurrence and spatial tracking; association with EUV wavefronts  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "providing evidence of a co-spatial Type II radio burst that track the propagating “EIT wave”."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Imaging observations of the spatial position of the radio source are "exceptionally rare" due to limited solar-dedicated radio imaging facilities.
