## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how the frequencies of global‐scale solar Rossby modes are affected by solar cycle variations in the Sun’s internal rotation. The study uses helioseismic measurements to infer the internal rotation profile over the Sun’s convection zone. Data from multiple instruments, spanning from 1996 to 2019, are employed to capture the evolution of the solar rotation rate, including its zonal flows and torsional oscillations. The instruments provide long-duration observations that are critical for resolving subtle frequency shifts in the Rossby modes, which are near the current limits of detectability.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) is used to perform helioseismic observations, allowing the measurement of the internal solar rotation profile within the convection zone. Its Doppler velocity measurements provide key inputs for inverting the solar rotation structure.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Helioseismology with data from the Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) (Scherrer et al. 1995) ... allowed the internal rotation proﬁle of the Sun to be measured in the convection zone."
   
#### Data Collection Period: Combined Data Set (1996 June 06 – 2019 June 30)
- **Time Range**: 1996 June 06 to 2019 June 30  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The data used here cover the period from 1996 June 06 to 2019 June 30, with a cadence of 72 days."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the text.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No wavelength information provided in the paper excerpt.]
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity signals from solar oscillations used for helioseismic inversions to infer the Sun’s internal rotation profile.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Helioseismology with data from... allowed the internal rotation proﬁle of the Sun to be measured..."

- **Additional Comments**:
   - The MDI data form part of a combined data set that also includes HMI measurements during overlapping periods to maintain continuity. The cadence of the data is 72 days.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) provides high-resolution helioseismic observations that complement MDI data. This instrument confirms the findings of the internal rotation profile and its time variability, particularly during the period of overlap with MDI.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Additionally, data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) (Schou et al. 2012) conﬁrmed these ﬁndings."

#### Data Collection Period: Overlap with MDI Data (Within 1996 June 06 – 2019 June 30)
- **Time Range**: The exact period of HMI observations is not separately specified, but HMI data are used during the period of overlap with MDI within the overall window from 1996 June 06 to 2019 June 30.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The HMI data are used during the period of overlap between MDI and HMI."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the paper excerpt.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No wavelength information provided in the paper excerpt.]
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity and magnetic field measurements used to derive the solar internal rotation and to verify the helioseismic inversions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Inferred from “confirmed these ﬁndings” regarding the rotation profile measurements.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - HMI contributes to ensuring the continuity and validation of rotation profile measurements during the overlapping observational period with MDI.

### 3. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG is a ground-based network of solar observatories that provides helioseismic data. Its measurements of the solar oscillations contribute to determining the internal rotation profile of the Sun, serving as an independent check against the space-based MDI and HMI data.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Helioseismology with data from the Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) (Hill et al. 1996) allowed the internal rotation proﬁle of the Sun to be measured in the convection zone."
   
#### Data Collection Period: Not Explicitly Specified
- **Time Range**: The specific observing dates for GONG data are not provided in the paper excerpt.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No explicit time range is mentioned for GONG data in the provided text.]
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the paper excerpt.
   - **Supporting Quote**: [No wavelength information provided in the paper excerpt.]
- **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity measurements from solar oscillations that are used to determine the Sun’s internal rotation profile.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Inferred from the context of internal rotation profile measurements in helioseismology.)
- **Additional Comments**:
   - GONG data serve as an important independent data source, confirming features such as the asymmetry between solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 in the rotation profile.
