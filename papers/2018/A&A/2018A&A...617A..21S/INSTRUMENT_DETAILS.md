## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the plasma filling factor in an erupting solar prominence embedded in a coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on August 2, 2000. The research relies critically on direct data collected with the LASCO-C2 coronagraph and the UVCS spectro-coronagraph, both located on board the SOHO spacecraft. These instruments provided simultaneous and cospatial visible-light and ultraviolet spectroscopic observations, notably of the hydrogen Lyman-α (1215.67 Å) and Lyman-β (1025.72 Å) lines, which were central to the derivation of the prominence filling factor. The analysis specifically focuses on two prominence points (P1 and P2), where both LASCO-C2 and UVCS measurements were available contemporaneously during the CME passage. The research utilizes these observations between approximately 16:04 UT and 19:30 UT on 2000-08-02, analyzing both the geometric and radiative properties of the prominence, and cross-validates observational findings against a detailed non-LTE model.

## Instrumentation Details

### UVCS (Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The UVCS was utilized to obtain spatially and temporally resolved ultraviolet spectra of multiple coronal lines during the 2000-08-02 CME, with specific focus on the Lyman-α and Lyman-β emission from the prominence core. UVCS data were obtained along a 40 arcmin long slit located at a heliocentric distance of 2.3 R⊙, enabling both spectroscopic line profile analysis and absolute intensity measurements. Observations were performed with integration times and spatial resolutions that matched the temporal and spatial evolution of the prominence as it crossed the instrument's field of view.
- **Supporting Quote**: "UVCS recorded spectra of several UV coronal lines (see Table 1 of Paper I for a complete list) as the prominence crossed its field of view (FOV), a 40 arcmin long slit placed perpendicularly to the solar radius at a latitude of 40◦NE and heliocentric distance of 2.3 R⊙(see Figure 1). In particular, spectral proﬁles of the neutral hydrogen Lyman-α (λ12 = 1215.67 Å) and Lyman-β (λ13 = 1025.72 Å) lines were acquired with spatial resolution of 21 arcsec (≈15000 km) and integration time of 120 s during all the CME event."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence passage during CME core
- **Time Range**: 2000-08-02, as the prominence crossed the UVCS slit between pre-event and event times, with explicit reference to 19:30 UT and contemporaneous with LASCO-C2 observations, and with relevant pre-event subtraction from 16:04 UT.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "UVCS recorded spectra of several UV coronal lines ... as the prominence crossed its field of view ... at a latitude of 40◦NE and heliocentric distance of 2.3 R⊙(see Figure 1)."  
    "Combination of Equations (6), (8), and (9) can be used to derive the filling factor from the observed intensities of the hydrogen Lyα and Lyβ lines if the electron column density is measured, for instance, from visible-light data"
  - **Supporting Quote**: “LASCO images were also used to measure the plane-of-the-sky (POS) velocity of the prominence, vPOS ≃300 km s−1, as well as its projected thickness, D ≃56000 km, which was taken as an approximation of the prominence average LOS thickness, under the simple assumption of cylindrical geometry.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Lyman-α (1215.67 Å), Lyman-β (1025.72 Å)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "spectral proﬁles of the neutral hydrogen Lyman-α (λ12 = 1215.67 Å) and Lyman-β (λ13 = 1025.72 Å) lines were acquired with spatial resolution of 21 arcsec (≈15000 km) and integration time of 120 s during all the CME event."
- **Physical Observable**: Intensity, line profiles (including Doppler widths and shifts), and radiative vs. collisional components of the Lyman-α and Lyman-β lines from the erupting prominence core.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Both lines systematically appear to be the superposition of two components with diﬀerent widths, the narrower one representing, in our interpretation, real prominence emission, while the broader one being more likely due to plasma in the PCTR or, alternatively, in the hot plasma shroud surrounding the prominence (see Habbal et al. 2010). Separation of the two components was performed with a double Gaussian ﬁt to the line proﬁles and its consistency was veriﬁed with a minimum chi-squared analysis (see Paper I)."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - UVCS intensities and line ratios at two specific slit locations (P1 and P2) provide the basis for all filling factor analysis and radiative transfer modeling.

### LASCO-C2 (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph - C2) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO-C2 was employed to measure the electron column density and apparent plane-of-sky velocities of CME/prominence plasma on 2000-08-02. Data products include total brightness and "excess-brightness" difference images. LASCO-C2 also provided the geometric thickness of the prominence along the LOS by measuring the width of the CME core. Observations are temporally matched to UVCS pointings for joint diagnostics.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Total-brightness LASCO images were used to infer the electron column density Ne of the CME and prominence plasma by applying the method described in Vourlidas et al. (2000) to the so-called “excess-brightness” image of the CME (see Figure 1), obtained by subtracting from the LASCO-C2 frame containing the CME at 19:30 UT, the pre-event frame acquired at 16:04 UT."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME core and prominence passage
- **Time Range**: 2000-08-02, with event frame at 19:30 UT and pre-event reference at 16:04 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "obtained by subtracting from the LASCO-C2 frame containing the CME at 19:30 UT, the pre-event frame acquired at 16:04 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible-light (total brightness and polarized white-light continuum)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Total-brightness LASCO images were used to infer the electron column density Ne of the CME and prominence plasma by applying the method described in Vourlidas et al. (2000) to the so-called “excess-brightness” image of the CME ..."
- **Physical Observable**: Electron column density, plane-of-sky velocity, and geometric thickness of the erupting prominence and CME core
  - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO images were also used to measure the plane-of-the-sky (POS) velocity of the prominence, vPOS ≃300 km s−1, as well as its projected thickness, D ≃56000 km, which was taken as an approximation of the prominence average LOS thickness, under the simple assumption of cylindrical geometry."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The electron column densities derived from LASCO-C2 are directly used for filling factor calculations and for constraining the non-LTE prominence model.

### SOHO/SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) [for disk reference profiles only]
- Not included, as SUMER data is only used to provide incident solar disk Lyα and Lyβ line profiles but is **not used for direct event plasma observation or analysis of the CME/prominence**, per requirements.
