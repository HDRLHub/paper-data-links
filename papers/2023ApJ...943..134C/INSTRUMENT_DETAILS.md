## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a detailed simulation of a Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event that occurred on May 29, 2020, which was observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and STEREO-A. The simulation uses a stochastic three-dimensional focused transport model to simulate the propagation and acceleration of SEPs, which are believed to be produced by a coronal mass ejection (CME) shock. The paper discusses the methodology of simulating the SEP event, including the modeling of the coronal and heliospheric magnetic fields, the injection and acceleration of particles at the CME shock, and the estimation of the SEP time-intensity profiles at different locations in the heliosphere. The results of the simulation are compared with observations from PSP and STEREO-A, providing insights into the acceleration mechanisms of SEPs and their propagation through interplanetary space.

## Instrumentation Details

### EPI-Hi on board Parker Solar Probe
- **General Comments**:
   - EPI-Hi is used to measure energetic protons and heavy ions ranging from approximately 1 to 100 MeV/nuc. It provides crucial data for comparing observed SEP events with simulation results.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the SEP event on 2020 May 29
- **Time Range**: May 29, 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The SEP event was associated with a very slow CME with a plane-of-sky speed of 337 km s−1 at a height below 6 RS as reported in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle detection)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specifically mentioned for wavelengths as the instrument measures particle energies.
- **Physical Observable**: Proton fluxes at different energy levels (e.g., 2.2 MeV and 12.3 MeV)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The flux of 2.2 MeV protons from both the simulation and the PSP measurements are in the same order of magnitude with the peak value of 0.32 (cm2 s sr MeV)−1 and 0.15 (cm2 s sr MeV)−1, respectively."
- **Additional Comments**: The observations from EPI-Hi are critical for validating the simulation results of SEP fluxes and energy spectra.

### LET on board STEREO-A
- **General Comments**:
   - The Low-Energy Telescope (LET) is instrumental in measuring proton intensities in the energy range of 1.8 to 6.0 MeV, providing data to compare with simulated SEP events.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the SEP event on 2020 May 29
- **Time Range**: May 29, 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The modeled flux of 5.0 MeV protons has a peak value around 3.6 × 10−3 (cm2 s sr MeV)−1, which is between the peak value of the 1.8–3.6 MeV and 4.0-6.0 MeV proton intensities measured by the Low-Energy Telescope (LET) on STEREO-A."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle detection)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specifically mentioned for wavelengths as the instrument measures particle energies.
- **Physical Observable**: Proton fluxes at different energy levels (e.g., 1.8–3.6 MeV and 4.0-6.0 MeV)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The modeled flux of 5.0 MeV protons has a peak value around 3.6 × 10−3 (cm2 s sr MeV)−1."
- **Additional Comments**: LET data are essential for assessing the accuracy of SEP simulations at different energy levels and distances from the Sun.

### SEPT on board STEREO-A
- **General Comments**:
   - SEPT measures lower energy protons and provides data to assess the presence and intensity of SEPs in different energy channels.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the SEP event on 2020 May 29
- **Time Range**: May 29, 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Low-energy particles have too small mean free paths to reach 1 au before they dissipate in interplanetary space through adiabatic cooling."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle detection)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specifically mentioned for wavelengths as the instrument measures particle energies.
- **Physical Observable**: Proton fluxes in the energy range of 1.11–1.98 MeV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Thus, this explains why no clearly enhancement of 1.11–1.98 MeV protons was seen by STEREO-A/SEPT."
- **Additional Comments**: SEPT data help in understanding the propagation and dissipation of lower energy SEPs in the heliosphere.
