## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates how aerodynamic drag acting on coronal mass ejections (CMEs) contributes to the global energetics of solar flares. Two analytical CME kinematic models – a constant-acceleration model and an aerodynamic drag model – are forward‐fitted to height‐time profiles obtained from LASCO/SOHO white‐light coronagraph data. The study utilizes 14,316 CME events observed over the first 8 years (2010–2017) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) era. In addition, supplementary data from AIA/SDO (EUV imaging), GOES (soft X-ray detection), and in‐situ instruments onboard WIND, ACE, and SOHO/CELIAS/MTOF/PM (for ICME arrival times) help correlate CME start times, measure flare-associated acceleration, and validate predictions of CME transit times to Earth. HMI/SDO datasets are also referenced for complementary magnetic field information.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. LASCO/SOHO (C2 and C3)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) onboard SOHO is used to capture the height–time profiles of CMEs in white light. The study exclusively utilizes data from the C2 and C3 coronagraphs since LASCO/C1 was disabled.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "From the LASCO/SOHO data archive, only C2 and C3 data have been used for uniformity, because LASCO/C1 has been disabled in June 1998."  
   - "we fit the analytical aerodynamic drag model ... to the height-time proﬁles r(t) of LASCO/SOHO data in 14,316 CME events observed during the ﬁrst 8 years (2010-2017) of the SDO era."
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Observations during 2010–2017
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "observed during the ﬁrst 8 years (2010-2017) of the SDO era"
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (coronagraph imaging based on Thomson scattering)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: Although not explicitly stated, LASCO observations are performed in white light.
- **Physical Observable**: Height–time profiles r(t), CME leading-edge velocities, and accelerations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The observed height-time proﬁles r(t) from LASCO data" are used to fit the dynamical models.
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO provides CME observations across a range of heliocentric distances (approximately 3–32 R⊙), making it ideal for analyzing CME propagation in the corona and the inner heliosphere.

### 2. AIA/SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO supplies crucial Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations that complement the white-light data from LASCO. AIA enables the detection of EUV dimming and other coronal changes that act as time markers for the initiation and early acceleration of CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "ensuring EUV coverage with AIA"  
   - "Another time marker of CME starting times is the EUV dimming, which has been measured with large statistics using AIA data."
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: SDO Era
- **Time Range**:  
   - Primarily 2010 – 2017 (SDO operational era); with a subset related to flare observations spanning the first 7 years (2010–2016).  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a subset of 576 M and X-class GOES ﬂare events that have been observed during the ﬁrst 7 years of the SDO mission (2010-2016)"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths (typical AIA bands, though exact wavelengths are not specified in the text)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "ensuring EUV coverage with AIA"
- **Physical Observable**: EUV dimming used to mark CME start times and infer flare-associated acceleration processes.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Another time marker of CME starting times is the EUV dimming, which has been measured with large statistics using AIA data."
- **Additional Comments**: AIA provides high-cadence imaging essential for resolving the rapid early acceleration (and associated dimming) in the low corona.

### 3. GOES
- **General Comments**:
   - The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) instruments record soft X-ray flux and are employed to determine flare start times. These timings are essential for correlating the initiation of flare energy release with the corresponding CME onset.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "we compare now these measurements with other data sets based on ... GOES data."  
   - "a subset of 576 M and X-class GOES ﬂare events" is analyzed to compare GOES flare start times with the extrapolated LASCO CME start times.
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare Observations during 2010–2016
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2016  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a subset of 576 M and X-class GOES ﬂare events that have been observed during the ﬁrst 7 years of the SDO mission (2010-2016)"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-rays (typically in the 1–8 Å range, although the exact band is not stated)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "soft X-ray emission (detected with GOES)"
- **Physical Observable**: Flare start times and soft X-ray flux profiles that provide timing benchmarks for CME initiation.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "... the GOES ﬂare start reference times tGOESs ..." and discussion of the time delay between GOES and LASCO extrapolated CME times.
- **Additional Comments**: GOES data are pivotal for establishing the near-simultaneity of flare and CME onset events as well as for evaluating the association rates between flares and CMEs.

### 4. WIND, ACE, and SOHO/CELIAS/MTOF/PM (In-Situ Instruments)
- **General Comments**:
   - These in-situ instruments enable the monitoring of the solar wind and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) near Earth. They provide critical arrival time and plasma/field measurements which are compared with the modeled CME transit times derived from LASCO data.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "Using data acquired with the instruments onboard WIND, ACE, SOHO/CELIAS/MTOF/PM, we obtain timing information for the arrival times at Earth from the ICME catalog"  
   - "the ICME catalog ... contains ICME observations during 1996-2018."
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: In-Situ Measurements
- **Time Range**:  
   - Catalog Time Range: 1996 – 2018  
   - Focused Study Period (SDO+LASCO era): 2010 – 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "During the SDO+LASCO era (2010-2017) ...", and "the ICME catalog ... contains ICME observations during 1996-2018"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (these instruments measure particles and fields in situ rather than electromagnetic wavelengths)
- **Physical Observable**: CME arrival times (shock or sudden commencement timing) at Earth, solar wind speeds, and plasma parameters.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we predict the arrival times τpred ... and compare these with the observed ICME propagation times τobs at Earth."
- **Additional Comments**: A subset of 11 ICME events from these instruments are used to validate the aerodynamic drag model predictions, with the paper reporting an overall arrival time prediction accuracy of approximately 23%.

### 5. HMI/SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO is briefly mentioned as part of the additional data sets used for comparison. While detailed observational parameters from HMI are not elaborated in the paper, HMI typically provides magnetic field measurements that can be complementary to the CME and flare analyses.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "we compare now these measurements with other data sets based on HMI/SDO, AIA/SDO, and GOES data."
        
#### Data Collection Period 1: SDO Era
- **Time Range**: Presumably 2010 onward, consistent with the SDO mission operational period.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified (HMI observes in the visible continuum and uses spectral lines for magnetic field inference)
- **Physical Observable**: Mainly photospheric magnetic field and helioseismic data; however, specific physical observables are not detailed in this particular study.
- **Additional Comments**: HMI is included to underline the multi-instrument approach for a comprehensive analysis though its specific role in the CME energetics application is secondary to that of AIA and GOES.
