## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the instability of high‐mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves propagating in a spinning solar macrospicule in the context of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI). The authors model the macrospicule as a weakly twisted, rotating cylindrical magnetic flux tube embedded in a less dense and cool coronal plasma. Detailed observational parameters—such as the axial velocity, rotational speed, width, height, and lifetime of the macrospicule—are taken from various past observations. The study relies heavily on previously acquired data from multiple space‐based instruments spanning several observation intervals and wavelength bands. The instruments provided critical measurements of spectral lines, imaging in extreme ultraviolet (EUV), and high‐resolution spectroscopy, with specific observational time ranges and wavelengths that play an important role in matching the theoretical instability conditions with solar observations.
