## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the structure of the heliosheath using direct measurements of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes from the High energy Suprathermal Time Of Flight sensor (HSTOF) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) over specific intervals from 1996 to 2010. The study directly analyzes ENA fluxes of hydrogen and helium measured by HSTOF in defined ecliptic sectors and during quiet periods when ion fluxes are low. These fluxes are compared with the energetic ion spectra obtained by Voyager 1’s Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) instrument for the time when Voyager 1 was traversing the inner heliosheath (2004–2009). The aim is to compare the regions and characteristics of the heliosheath observed by SOHO/HSTOF and Voyager 1, using actual data from both instruments as the basis of their analysis and derived results.

## Instrumentation Details

### High energy Suprathermal Time Of Flight sensor (HSTOF) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - HSTOF is the principal instrument providing data for ENA flux measurements analyzed in this paper; it directly measures energetic neutral hydrogen and helium atoms in well-defined energy intervals and ecliptic sectors during periods between 1996 and 2010. Its data form the basis for comparison with Voyager 1 measurements and are used to derive new heliosheath properties.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "From the year 1996 until now, High energy Suprathermal Time Of Flight sensor (HSTOF) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) has been measuring the heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENA) ﬂux between ±17◦from the ecliptic plane."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Main epochs of HSTOF ENA data analysis (quiet solar wind times)
- **Time Range**: 1996–2010, with specific attention to 1996–1997, 1996–2005, 1998–2006, 2006–2008, 2008–2010
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We present the HSTOF hydrogen and helium ENA ﬂuxes averaged over selected time intervals between the years 1996 and 2010."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We compared the HSTOF ENA ﬂux data from the forward and ﬂank sectors of the heliosphere observed in various time periods between the years 1996 and 2010..."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The ENA observations by HSTOF are only possible during quiet times when the ambient energetic ion ﬂuxes are low (Hilchenbach et al. 1998, 2001). In consequence, the HSTOF ENA data come predominantly from the periods near the solar minima: the years 1996−1997 (during the year 1998 the contact with SOHO was lost for a time) and the years 2008−2010 (for which the forward and tail sectors cannot be observed)."

- **Wavelength(s)**: Hydrogen (58–88 keV); Helium (28–58 keV/nucleon)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The instrument HSTOF (Hovestadt et al. 1995), which is a part of the experiment Charge, Element and Isotope Analysis System (CELIAS) on board SOHO, measures hydrogen (58−88 keV) and helium (28−58 keV n−1) ENA ﬂuxes within ±17◦from the ecliptic."
- **Physical Observable**: ENA fluxes (hydrogen and helium) in distinct ecliptic longitude sectors (forward, flanks, tail)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Aims. We use HSTOF ENA data and Voyager 1 energetic ion spectrum to compare the regions of the heliosheath observed by HSTOF and Voyager 1."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The ENA fluxes measured during the latter period are signiﬁcantly lower than for the years 1996−1997 (Czechowski et al. 2012)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The data sets are partitioned according to heliospheric sector, and analyses specifically target intervals of minimal background from solar energetic particles, to ensure clean ENA signal attribution to heliosheath sources.

### Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) instrument on board Voyager 1
- **General Comments**:
  - The Voyager 1 LECP instrument's measurements of energetic ions in the inner heliosheath (post-termination shock) are directly used for comparing predicted ENA flux with HSTOF observations and for modeling source region thickness.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Throughout this paper, we use a simple ﬁt (Hsieh et al. 2010) to the Voyager 1 LECP ion spectrum in the inner heliosheath (i.e., between the termination shock and heliopause) Voyager 1 LECP observations refer to the ions with Z ≥1 and energies >40 keV."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Voyager 1 in the inner heliosheath (termination shock to heliopause)
- **Time Range**: 2004 day-of-year 249 – 2009 day-of-year 105 (i.e., 2004-09-05 to 2009-04-15), extended for some calculations to 2012
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The ﬁt covers the period between 2004 DOY 249 and 2009 DOY 105. The ion ﬂux measured by Voyager 1 was fairly steady over this period except for transient eﬀects."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "From Voyager 1 LECP measurements between the termination shock and heliopause, we derive the ENA ﬂux (in the HSTOF energy range) from the Voyager 1 direction."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ions with energies >40 keV; modeled over 58–88 keV for comparison with HSTOF ENA
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Voyager 1 LECP observations refer to the ions with Z ≥1 and energies >40 keV."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For JZ≥1,V1 we use the same power-law ﬁt as in Hsieh et al. (2010), i.e., JZ≥1,V1 = AE−γ , where A = 183.5, γ = 1.6, E is in keV and J in (cm2 s sr keV)−1."
- **Physical Observable**: Fluxes of energetic ions (Z≥1, mainly protons and heavy ions) in the inner heliosheath, used to estimate ENA production and compare with SOHO/HSTOF ENA observations
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "From Voyager 1 LECP measurements between the termination shock and heliopause, we derive the ENA ﬂux (in the HSTOF energy range) from the Voyager 1 direction."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The Voyager 1 data are specifically used to model the ion source spectrum for ENA production, with results contextualized for direct comparison to HSTOF-derived ENA fluxes.
