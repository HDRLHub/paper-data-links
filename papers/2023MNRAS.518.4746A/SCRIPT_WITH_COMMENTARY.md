This script sets up the queries for the MDI and HMI instruments based on the specific requirements from the context. It uses the `Fido.search` function from SunPy to query the VSO for the specified time ranges, instruments, wavelengths, and physical observables. The results of these queries are printed, and the actual data download commands are commented out, as per the directive. This script ensures that the queries are aligned with the data used in the context and avoids any unnecessary complexity.
