## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the extremely widespread solar energetic particle (SEP) event of 26 Dec 2013, utilizing both remote-sensing and in-situ spacecraft data. The focus is on characterizing long-lasting injections of solar energetic electrons, analyzing observations from multiple well-separated spacecraft: STEREO-A, STEREO-B, SOHO, ACE, and Wind. The data collection includes energetic particle measurements (electrons, protons), solar wind plasma and magnetic fields, coronagraph and EUV imagery, and radio observations. Specific attention is given to the detailed timing (with precise UTC context), spectral information (e.g., electron and proton energy ranges), and multi-instrument corroboration, forming the foundation for the study's analysis of complex solar phenomena, CME interactions, and unusual SEP event morphology throughout 26 December 2013.
