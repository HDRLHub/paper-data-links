## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper presents a new method for estimating flare reconnection flux (RC flux) using post-eruption arcades (PEAs) observed in EUV wavelengths and the corresponding underlying photospheric magnetic field. This arcade method is contrasted with the classical flare ribbon method, which uses Hα or TRACE 1600 Å observations to measure flare ribbon areas. The study applies both methods to a set of 21 well-observed solar eruptions, all of which resulted in magnetic clouds (MCs) detected at Earth during Solar Cycle 23. The events were chosen for their proximity to disk center (within ±15° longitude), to ensure a reliable Sun-Earth association. The RC flux values derived from both arcade and ribbon techniques are compared, and their relationship with the poloidal fluxes of MCs at 1 AU (as measured in situ) is analyzed. For each event, the specific dates and times of both solar and interplanetary observations are clearly tied to the analysis, with full context for each instrument's usage.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - MDI line-of-sight magnetograms are used to quantify the photospheric magnetic field underlying either the post-eruption arcade areas (EUV polygon) or flare ribbon regions, providing the flux values essential for reconnection flux calculations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The outline of the cumulative ribbon areas are superposed over a magnetogram obtained by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et al., 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo et al., 1995) as shown in Figure 1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement of magnetic field underlying PEAs and flare ribbons during specific events
- **Time Range**:  
  - For 12 May 1997 event: "superposed on an MDI magnetogram obtained at 04:52 UT"
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The outline of the cumulative ribbon areas are superposed over a magnetogram obtained by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et al., 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo et al., 1995) as shown in Figure 1. … an MDI magnetogram obtained at 04:52 UT"
  - For 12 May 1997 event (arcade method): "an MDI magnetogram obtained at 16:04 UT"
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The polygon from panel (a) is superposed on an MDI magnetogram at 16:04 UT."
  - For all 21 events: "we superposed on a magnetogram obtained around the time of the PEA image"
    - **Supporting Quote**: "overlay the polygon on a magnetogram obtained around the time of the PEA image, and sum the absolute value of the photospheric magnetic flux in all the pixels within the polygon."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - MDI is a photospheric magnetograph observing the Ni I 6768 Å line (noted for completeness; not verbatim in this text).
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Photospheric magnetic field (line-of-sight component)
    - **Supporting Quote**: "sum the absolute value of the photospheric magnetic flux in all the pixels within the polygon."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - MDI magnetograms are always taken at times closely matched or interpolated with the EUV or ribbon imaging for each event.

### Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) aboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - EIT 195 Å (EUV) full-disk images are used to identify and demarcate post-eruption arcade areas, which are then overlaid onto MDI magnetograms to determine the total underlying magnetic flux for the RC flux calculation.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "In order to compute ФrA, we consider a 195 Å EUV image at 16:50 UT obtained by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudiniére et al., 1995) on board SOHO. By visual examination, we marked the edges of the PEA as a polygon..."

- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Post-eruption arcade (PEA) emission in the corona (EUV)
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The post-eruption arcade (PEA) technique to determine Фr makes use of the close relationship between flare ribbons and PEAs because the ribbons essentially mark the footprints of PEAs."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Arcade areas are demarcated via polygon tracing for subsequent flux calculation.

### Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE)
- **General Comments**:
  - TRACE UV images at 1600 Å are used to provide high-cadence and high-resolution observations of flare ribbons for some of the events, facilitating traditional ribbon-based RC flux calculation. TRACE 171 Å images are used for complementary PEA visualization.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Flare ribbons observed with TRACE at 1600 Å. Figure 3 shows an event with PEAs from SOHO/EIT 195 Å and TRACE 171 Å, while the ribbons are from TRACE 1600 Å."

- **Time Range**:  
  - For 14 July 2000 event: "71 of the 381 TRACE 1600 Å images available between 10:00 UT and 14:59 UT"
    - **Supporting Quote**: "We used 71 of the 381 TRACE 1600 Å images available between 10:00 UT and 14:59 UT to obtain the ribbon area as 5.64×1019 cm2."
  - For events listed in Table 2:  
    - "When we searched for ribbon observations in TRACE 1600 Å data, we found eight events (Nos. 19, 21, 32, 43, 45, 46, 49, and 53 noted with a superscript “T” in column 10). For event No. 43 there was only one frame in the rise phase, so the ribbon area is an underestimate. The remaining seven events had usable TRACE data."

### Wind and ACE spacecraft, 1-AU in situ measurements
- **General Comments**:
  - In situ plasma and magnetic field measurements at 1 AU are used to identify and characterize magnetic clouds (MCs) for each analyzed eruption, in order to derive the poloidal magnetic flux of each MC for correlation with the solar RC flux.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "the 12 May 1997 eruption, which resulted in a magnetic cloud (MC) detected by the Wind and Advance Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft (Gopalswamy et al., 2010)."
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The fitted parameters of the MCs are available online (http://wind.nasa.gov/mfi/mag_cloud_S1.html)."
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Of the 54 ICMEs, only 23 were MCs. For one of the MCs, there was no EIT observations. For another event, the arcade at the Sun was not well defined. Excluding these two events, we have listed the remaining 21 events in Table 1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic cloud detection at 1 AU following specific solar eruption events
- **Time Range**:  
  - For each event, MC dates are listed explicitly, e.g., "DateList1. MC 1997/05/15"

    - **Supporting Quote**: "the poloidal flux Фp of MCs computed from the Lundquist solution (Lepping et al., 1990) is listed in column 13. Of the many output parameters obtained by the flux rope fitting, we use the axial field strength (B0) and the flux rope radius (R0) at 1-AU to get the poloidal field of the MC"
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The MC parameters for these events were derived directly from Wind/ACE magnetic field/plasma data (1 AU).

### Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT)
- **General Comments**:
  - SXT images are used for visualizing the PEA during some events in soft X-rays, confirming arcade structure and, where appropriate, for identifying the spatial extent of arcades for polygon demarcation.
