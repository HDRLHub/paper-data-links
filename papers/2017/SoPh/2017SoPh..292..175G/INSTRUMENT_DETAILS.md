## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the rearrangements of open magnetic flux and the formation of polar coronal holes (PCHs) during Solar Cycle 24. The authors develop and apply a method of synoptic map assimilation to analyze global changes in the Sun’s magnetic fields and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission distributions. Their approach utilizes direct observational data from multiple solar observatories, including synoptic maps of the radial component of the magnetic field and coronal hole (CH) distributions covering Carrington Rotations (CRs) 1910–2190 (approximately 1996.42–2017.40 years). The study draws upon synoptic and daily data from the National Solar Observatory (NSO) Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope (KPVT), the SOLIS Vector Spectro-magnetograph (SOLIS/VSM), the Global Oscillation Network Group (NSO/GONG), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SoHO/EIT), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), with a focus on Fe I 8688 Å, Fe I 6302.5 Å, Ni I 6768 Å, He I 10830 Å, and Fe XII 193/195 Å lines. The analysis integrates time-latitude behavior, data assimilation, and various image-processing techniques to derive physical observables such as open magnetic field distributions and CH locations integral to the study’s findings.
