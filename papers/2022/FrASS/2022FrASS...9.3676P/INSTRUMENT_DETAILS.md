# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the initiation and interplanetary evolution of a stealthy streamer-blowout coronal mass ejection (SBO-CME) observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at approximately 0.5 AU. The study utilizes a combination of remote-sensing and in-situ observations to analyze the CME's formation, launch, and interaction with the heliospheric magnetic field and plasma sheet structures. The SBO-CME was preceded by consecutive eruptions, suggesting a multi-stage sympathetic breakout scenario. The paper estimates that 18 ± 11% of the CME’s azimuthal magnetic flux was eroded through magnetic reconnection, starting after the CME reached a heliospheric distance of about 0.35 AU from the Sun.
