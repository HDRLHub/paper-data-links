1. # Portable Auroral Imager (PAI) on a Ground-Based Facility in Churchill, MB  
   - **General Comments**:
      - This is an intensified, narrow field-of-view (FOV) CCD-based TV camera used to capture auroral images. It was manually pointed during observations and mounted on a tripod at a ground location near Churchill, Manitoba.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The images used in this analysis were taken from an intensified, narrow field-of-view (FOV) CCD-based TV camera known as the Portable Auroral Imager (PAI) (Trondsen & Cogger, 1997).”
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: Auroral Imaging on March 15, 2002  
      - **Time Range**: Approximately 6:40 – 8:40 UT on March 15, 2002 (corresponding to 0:06 to 2:06 magnetic local time).  
         - **Supporting Quote**: “They were taken at 30 frames-per-second (fps) and span from approximately 6:40 to 8:40 universal time (UT) or 0:06 to 2:06 magnetic local time (MLT) on March 15, 2002.”
      - **Wavelength(s)**:  
         - Although the camera captured “white-light” images without additional spectral breakdown, it was equipped with a Wratten 89B IR filter having a cutoff wavelength of 650 nm.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “...equipped with a 25 mm lens in addition to a Wratten 89B IR filter with a cutoff wavelength of 650 nm.”
      - **Physical Observable**:  
         - The instrument recorded the brightness and spatial structure of diffuse aurora and related auroral features (e.g., the diﬀuse auroral eraser phenomenon).
         - **Supporting Quote**: “...in the first image the aurora begins as a diﬀuse background. In the second image a diﬀuse auroral arc appears in the form of a brighter stripe...”
      - **Additional Comments**:  
         - The camera’s setup resulted in a 30.9° by 23.2° field-of-view and a pixel resolution of 88 m by 88 m at an altitude of 105 km.

2. # NASA/GSFC OMNI Data Set (incorporating WIND, ACE, and other spacecraft)  
   - **General Comments**:
      - This database compiles solar wind parameters and magnetic field data from several spacecraft. In this study, the authors used it to obtain solar wind speed and accompanying magnetospheric parameters.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “The solar wind speed as extracted from NASA/GSFC’s OMNI data set through OMNIWeb...”
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Wind and Magnetic Conditions during the Event  
      - **Time Range**: Data corresponding to the night of March 15, 2002 (covering the period of the auroral observations).  
         - **Supporting Quote**: “...on March 15, 2002.” (Implied by context as the conditions are discussed in relation to that night’s auroral events.)
      - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
      - **Physical Observable**:  
         - Parameters such as solar wind speed (340–360 km/s), Bz (0 to 6 nT), KP index (< 2), and Dst index (> −20 nT) were derived from this database.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “...Bz ranged between 0 and 6 nT, the KP index was < 2, and the Dst index was > −20 nT.”
      - **Additional Comments**:  
         - The OMNI data set integrates measurements from multiple spacecraft (e.g., WIND and ACE), allowing for a comprehensive view of the solar wind conditions during the observing campaign.

3. # SuperMAG Ground-Based Magnetometers  
   - **General Comments**:
      - SuperMAG is a network of over 300 ground-based magnetometers that measure magnetic field components in three directions. In this study, data from select magnetometers in and around Churchill, as well as from stations in Greenland and Svalbard, were analyzed.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “SuperMAG is a database of over 300 magnetometers, each of which measures magnetic fields in 3 directions (Gjerloev, 2009, 2012).”
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: Ground Magnetometer Observations on March 15, 2002  
      - **Time Range**: During the night of March 15, 2002.  
         - **Supporting Quote**: “We looked at data from several stations during the night of March 15, 2002.”
      - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
      - **Physical Observable**:  
         - They provided measurements of the magnetic field in three spatial directions, with the highest fidelity configuration yielding a 1-minute resolution.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “Data from Churchill (FCC) and surrounding magnetometers (IQA, SKT)... The highest ﬁdelity option was 1 minute, so we were unable to see any higher frequency modulations.”
      - **Additional Comments**:  
         - While most stations showed no major perturbations, magnetometers from the north-east coast of Greenland and Svalbard did record small wave-like fluctuations.
