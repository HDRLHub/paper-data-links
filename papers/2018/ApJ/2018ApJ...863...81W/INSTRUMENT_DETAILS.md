## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a solar eruption on 2015 November 4 that originated from the peripheral diffusive polarities of active region AR 12443. Observations from multiple spaceborne platforms were utilized to capture the formation and eruption of a flux rope as well as the associated geomagnetic impact measured near the Earth. The study combines high-cadence extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging to reveal helical structures in the corona, high-resolution magnetograms to track the evolution of converging and canceling photospheric magnetic fields, and coronagraph as well as in situ data to track the CME propagation and its interplanetary effects. Specific observation intervals, such as EUV imaging around 13:20–13:33 UT for the eruption and LASCO C2 observations at 14:48 UT, and ACE in situ measurements with a shock arrival at 17:34 UT on November 6, are integral in correlating solar surface processes with near-Earth space weather events.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides both line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field data and vector magnetograms (via the SHARP data product) with high cadence. It is critical for mapping the magnetic field evolution that includes converging motions, flux cancellation, and magnetic shear associated with the formation of the flux rope.

   - "The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board SDO provided high temporal resolution full disk line of sight (LOS) magnetic field data with a 45 s cadence and 0”.5 original pixel size and photospheric vector magnetograms from the data product, called Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs; Bobra et al. 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2014)..."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic Field and Flow Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Multiple intervals including a snapshot at 13:22:57 UT, and an averaged flow map from 07:00 UT to 12:00 UT on November 4, 2015
      - **Supporting Quote**: 
         - "Figure 5 shows the flow map averaged from 07:00 UT to 12:00 UT, which presents obvious converging motions..."
         - and "HMI LOS magnetogram at 13:22:57 UT" (inferred from context).
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms measure magnetic field intensities rather than specific wavelengths)
   - **Physical Observable**:
      - Photospheric magnetic field strength, direction, and evolution including flux cancellation and converging flows.
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - "the evolution of the unsigned magnetic flux shows decreasing trend confirming the converging and cancelling processes..."
   - **Additional Comments**:
      - The high-resolution data (0”.5 pixel size, 45 s cadence) was fundamental for applying tracking techniques (e.g., DAVE4VM) to derive the velocity fields along the polarity inversion line (PIL).

### 3. LASCO C2 (and C3) Coronagraphs
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO C2 (and C3) onboard the SOHO spacecraft monitored the CME as it emerged and evolved beyond the solar limb. These coronagraphs capture white-light images of the CME structure.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Soon after, a halo CME started emerging from LASCO C2 at 14:48 UT as shown in Figure 1b."
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME Emergence and Propagation**
   - **Time Range**: The CME is observed beginning at 14:48 UT on November 4, 2015

   - **Additional Comments**:
      - LASCO C2/C3 data provided critical context for linking the low-corona EUV observations with the large-scale CME dynamics.
