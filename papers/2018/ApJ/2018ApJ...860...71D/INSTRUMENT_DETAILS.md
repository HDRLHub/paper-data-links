## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents an analytical diffusion–expansion model (ForbMod) designed to explain Forbush decreases (FDs) caused by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) with flux rope (FR) structures. It develops an analytical solution based on the gradual, perpendicular diffusion of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) into the FR while accounting for the self‐similar CME expansion. A case study of a 2014 May 30 FD is used, with the CME remotely observed by several coronagraphs and in situ FD measurements obtained by spacecraft and ground–based detectors. The work compares its model with results from previous observational studies and discusses the interplay of diffusion and expansion using data collected over several time intervals during CME propagation from the Sun to Earth.
