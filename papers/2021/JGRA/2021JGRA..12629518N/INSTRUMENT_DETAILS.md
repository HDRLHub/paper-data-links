## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a multipoint, multiscale study of fast flows and dipolarization front dynamics in the near‐Earth magnetotail preceding a weak substorm on 8 September 2018. Two spacecraft constellations – Cluster and MMS – were used to capture simultaneous in situ observations of plasma flow, magnetic field reconfigurations, current sheet changes, and electron acceleration. The study highlights the detection of a dipolarization front (DF) by both missions (MMS at ~14:01:02 UT and Cluster at ~14:01:12 UT), current sheet thickening followed by rapid thinning, and distinct flow reversals which are examined via high‐resolution measurements of field‐aligned currents and plasma moments. Detailed gradients in the magnetic field and electric field variations, including Hall effects in the dipolarizing flux bundle region, are used to deduce the spatial structure and time evolution of these transient events.
