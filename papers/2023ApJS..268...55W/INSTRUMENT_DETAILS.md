## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the development of a live, homogeneous database of solar active regions (ARs) using synoptic magnetograms from the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI instruments. The primary research objective is to automatically detect and calibrate ARs from 1996 onwards to understand and predict solar cycle behaviors. The paper details a method that enhances the detection of ARs by excluding decayed and unipolar regions and is compatible with any available synoptic magnetograms. The AR flux and area are calibrated using co-temporal data from both instruments, and the database's reliability is verified against other databases. The study provides basic parameters like location, area, and flux of identified ARs, which are crucial for quantifying their impact on solar activity over long periods.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI is used to obtain full-disk magnetograms which are crucial for constructing synoptic maps used in AR detection. The instrument's data contributes to understanding the distribution and evolution of solar magnetic fields.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full observation period for constructing synoptic maps
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – May 2010
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: Data gaps exist due to SOHO spacecraft malfunctions, specifically during Carrington Rotations (CRs) 1938-1940, and partially in CRs 1909, 1910, 1937, 1941-1946, 1956, 1986, 2004, 2005, 2011, 2015, 2052, and 2086.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI continues the observation of solar magnetic fields with high-resolution synoptic magnetograms, extending the data range provided by SOHO/MDI and enhancing the long-term study of solar activity.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full observation period for constructing synoptic maps
- **Time Range**: June 2010 – December 2022
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Solar magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data starts immediately after the end of MDI data, ensuring a continuous observation period for the study.
