## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies the long-term behavior of the sunspot penumbra to umbra area ratio using two independent datasets. The primary data source is the Kodaikanal white-light digital archive spanning 1923–2011 that covers eight solar cycles (Cycles 16–23). In addition, the study validates its automated umbra extraction technique—based on the Otsu thresholding method—using continuum images from the SOHO/MDI instrument acquired between 1996 and 2010. The analysis focuses on extracting distinct features from sunspots (umbra versus penumbra) and comparing these with previous measurements to understand solar cycle variability.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Kodaikanal White-light Full Disk Imager at Kodaikanal Solar Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument provided the long-term white-light full disk images used in the study. The dataset is digitized and calibrated, and it served as the primary resource for detecting sunspots and isolating the umbra using an automated Otsu thresholding technique.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "In this study, we have used the newly digitized and calibrated white-light full disk images (Figure 1a) from Kodaikanal Solar Observatory." 
  - "We study the long-term behaviour of sunspot penumbra to umbra area ratio by analyzing the recently digitized Kodaikanal white-light data (1923-2011)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sunspot Observation over Multiple Solar Cycles
- **Time Range**: 1923 – 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "digitized Kodaikanal white-light data (1923-2011)" and "a total of 8 solar cycle (Cycles 16-23) data of Kodaikanal white-light digitized archive (1923-2011)"  
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (Visible wavelengths)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Sunspots... appear dark when observed in visible wavelengths" and the use of "white-light full disk images" implies observations in the visible continuum.
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot umbral and penumbral areas  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we compute the penumbra to umbra area ratio as: Ratio = q = AW/AU"  
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The data from this instrument has been processed using a semi-automated detection algorithm and further refined with an adaptive thresholding method based on Otsu’s technique.

### 2. SOHO/MDI Continuum Imager on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The SOHO/MDI instrument provided space-based continuum images that were used to validate the umbra detection method developed for the Kodaikanal data set. The dataset includes nearly daily images, and the analysis was performed for the period 1996–2010.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "We analyse SOHO/MDI (Scherrer et al., 1995) continuum images from 1996 to 2010 with a frequency of one image per day."  
  - "To check the robustness of our umbra detection technique, we analysed SOHO/MDI continuum images."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sunspot Observation for Continuum Imaging
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2010  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "continuum images from SOHO/MDI from 1996 to 2010"  
- **Wavelength(s)**: Continuum (White-light, visible wavelengths)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: Although specific wavelengths are not mentioned, the term "continuum images" indicates the use of a broad white-light band from the visible spectrum.
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot umbral and whole spot areas leading to the determination of the penumbra to umbra area ratio  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we detect the sunspots using the same Sunspot Tracking and Recognition Algorithm (STARA)... The detected spots are then fed to the Otsu algorithm for umbra detection."  
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - While the absolute values from MDI had to be scaled slightly (by adding a constant factor) due to the presence of bright pixels near spot boundaries, the overall trends in the area ratios match those from the Kodaikanal data.
