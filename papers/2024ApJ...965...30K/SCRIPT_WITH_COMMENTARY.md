This script sets up a query for the SWAN instrument on the SOHO spacecraft, specifically targeting the Solar Lyα line at 1215.6 Å, which is relevant to the study of helioglow intensity variations. The query covers the entire operational period of SWAN from its start date to the present. The results of the query are printed, and the actual data download command is commented out, as per the directive.
