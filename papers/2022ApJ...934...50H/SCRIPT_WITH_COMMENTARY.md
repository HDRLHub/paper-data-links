### Explanation:
1. **Time Ranges**: The script defines specific time ranges for the Wind and VEX spacecraft based on the observation periods mentioned in the paper. These time ranges are crucial for retrieving the relevant data for the magnetic cloud event.
2. **Instrument Specification**: The queries specify the instruments (`WIND` for the Wind spacecraft and `VEX` for the Venus Express spacecraft). This is essential as the data needed is specific to the instruments that recorded the magnetic field and plasma parameters.
3. **Query Execution**: The `Fido.search` function is used to construct and execute the queries based on the defined attributes.
4. **Result Display**: The script prints out the results of the queries to provide an overview of the available data for the specified time ranges and instruments.
5. **Data Download**: The lines for downloading the data (`Fido.fetch`) are commented out to prevent automatic execution, allowing for manual activation if data download is desired.

This script is tailored to the context provided, focusing solely on the data relevant to the study's needs without straying into unnecessary details or data types.
