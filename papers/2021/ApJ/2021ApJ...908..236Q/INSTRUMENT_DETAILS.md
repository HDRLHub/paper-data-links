## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates Forbush decreases (Fds) in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity in association with interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) during the ground‐level enhancement event (GLE59) of 14 July 2000. Using numerical simulations based on the focused transport equation, the authors reproduce the observed two‐step decrease in cosmic ray intensity. The study emphasizes the roles of the sheath region and the magnetic cloud (MC) – distinguished by their different magnetic turbulence levels and background magnetic fields – in producing a rapid decrease followed by a prolonged recovery phase. Observational data from ground‐based neutron monitors and in situ measurements from a spacecraft are used to constrain and compare with the simulation outcomes.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Oulu Neutron Monitor (NM)
- **General Comments**:
  - This ground‐based detector continuously records the cosmic ray count rate. In the context of the paper, it is used to observe the normalized intensity of galactic cosmic rays during the GLE59 event and to resolve the two‐step decrease linked with the passage of the sheath region and magnetic cloud.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "Panel (a) is the normalized count rate from the Oulu neutron monitor (NM)."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Sheath-related Decrease
- **Time Range**: Approximately 19:00 UT on 15 July 2000 – 21:00 UT on 15 July 2000  
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "An ICME behind the second shock was observed at the Earth with start and end times 19:00 UT on 15 July and 8:00 UT on 17 July indicated by the two red vertical lines."  
    - (In conjunction with the following observation) "The ejecta is believed to be a MC ... with boundaries at 21:00 UT 15 July ...", which implies that the time immediately preceding the MC (i.e., the sheath) is captured by the NM as a distinct step in the decrease.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Normalized cosmic ray intensity (count rate).
- **Additional Comments**: The observed rapid drop to about 0.97 in normalized intensity coincides with the arrival of the shock and the sheath region at the Earth.

#### Data Collection Period 2: MC-related Decrease
- **Time Range**: Approximately 21:00 UT on 15 July 2000 – 10:00 UT on 16 July 2000  
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "The ejecta is believed to be a MC (Richardson & Cane 2010) with boundaries at 21:00 UT 15 July and 10:00 UT on 16 July denoted by the two blue vertical lines."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Normalized cosmic ray intensity (count rate).
- **Additional Comments**: The second, deeper step decrease to nearly 0.9 in cosmic ray intensity is observed when the MC's leading edge arrives, with recovery occurring gradually over several days thereafter.

### 2. Wind Spacecraft – In Situ Magnetic Field Instrumentation
- **General Comments**:
  - The Wind spacecraft provides in situ measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Its magnetometer data – specifically the intensity, polar angle, and azimuthal angle of the IMF in Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinates – are used to identify dynamic features such as the impulsive magnetic field enhancement in the sheath region and the background field enhancement associated with the MC.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "Panels (b), (c) and (d) present the intensity, polar angle, and azimuthal angle of interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) in GSE angular coordinates from the Wind spacecraft, respectively."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Sheath-related Measurements
- **Time Range**: Approximately 19:00 UT on 15 July 2000 – 21:00 UT on 15 July 2000  
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "Panel (b) exhibits that the sheath region between the ICME shock and ICME’s leading edge had an impulsive magnetic ﬁeld enhancement right behind the ICME shock."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field intensity and its directional (polar and azimuthal) measurements.
- **Additional Comments**: The in situ break in the IMF data provided by Wind is correlated with the onset of the first step decrease observed by the NM.

#### Data Collection Period 2: MC-related Measurements
- **Time Range**: Approximately 21:00 UT on 15 July 2000 – 10:00 UT on 16 July 2000  
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "The background magnetic ﬁeld enhanced again when the ICME arrived at the Earth and the enhancement lasted until the MC left the Earth."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field intensity and directional angles, reflecting the structured enhancement in the MC.
- **Additional Comments**: The Wind data, covering the period of the MC passage, support the simulation’s inference that a distinct MC structure is responsible for the second step in the Fd profile.
