## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the properties and poleward migration of Polar Crown Filaments (PCFs) over the past four solar cycles (cycles 21 to 24). It utilizes full-disk Hα observations spanning from 1973 to early 2018, obtained from two major ground‐based observatories, along with magnetograms from several spaceborne instruments that provide measurements of the polar magnetic fields. The Hα data are sourced in two formats – digitized 35‑mm film data (1973–1996) and digital CCD data (1997–2018) – ensuring a long-term homogeneous record of PCFs. The magnetograms from the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP), the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are used for tracing the evolution of the polar magnetic fields. These observational elements, including the specified time ranges and instrument details, are integral to the findings regarding migration rates, N-S asymmetries, and correlations with magnetic field reversals during different solar cycles.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Hα Observations by Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory (KSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - KSO provided full-disk Hα images that are used to identify and track the evolution of Polar Crown Filaments (PCFs) over several decades. The observations include two distinct data types: digitized 35‑mm film images and digital CCD images.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In this study, we investigate PCFs using full disk Hα data from 1973 to early 2018, recorded by Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory (KSO) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018 and in 35 mm film (digitized) from 1973 to 1996.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Film Data Observations
- **Time Range**: 1973 to 1996  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...recorded by Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory (KSO) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018 and in 35 mm film (digitized) from 1973 to 1996.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα (Hydrogen-alpha)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “KSO and BBSO have long history in Hα observations, which are favorable data sets for filament detection because of the suitable formation temperature of about 10000 K.”
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk images capturing Polar Crown Filaments  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “PCFs are identified manually because their segmented shape and close-to-limb location were not handled well by automatical detections in several previous studies.”
- **Additional Comments**: The film data, despite being non-linear, provides adequate contrast for identifying the filaments due to their prominent appearance in Hα images.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Digital Data Observations
- **Time Range**: 1997 to 2018  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...recorded by Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory (KSO) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα  
   - **Supporting Quote**: Same as above, Hα observations are used due to the temperature sensitivity (formation temperature ~10000 K).
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk Hα images used for tracking the positions and evolution of PCFs  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “PCFs usually appear on the disk for several weeks or months, we used the daily images instead of the high cadence 1-min data.”
- **Additional Comments**: The digital data are stored in the FITS format, which allows for direct registration to heliographic coordinates, and they benefit from corrections for dark and flat fields.

### 2. Hα Observations by Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - BBSO is the second source of full-disk Hα images used in this study. Its data complement those from KSO, forming a continuous record of PCFs over the spanning period.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...recorded by Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory (KSO) and Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), in digital form from 1997 to 2018 and in 35 mm film (digitized) from 1973 to 1996.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Film Data Observations
- **Time Range**: 1973 to 1996  
   - **Supporting Quote**: Same quote as above that indicates the film data period, which applies jointly for observations from both observatories.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...Hα data...”
- **Physical Observable**: Images of Polar Crown Filaments  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “PCFs are identified manually...”
- **Additional Comments**: The film data from BBSO are digitized for scientific analysis, following similar processing protocols as KSO’s film data.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Digital Data Observations
- **Time Range**: 1997 to 2018  
   - **Supporting Quote**: The same statement that digital data are available from 1997 to 2018.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα  
   - **Supporting Quote**: As above for Hα observations.
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk Hα images that capture the spatial positions and morphology of PCFs.  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “PCFs usually appear on the disk for several weeks or months, we used the daily images...”
- **Additional Comments**: BBSO’s digital images are available in a common format (FITS), allowing precise registration to heliographic coordinates.

### 3. Magnetograms from NSO/KP (National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument suite involves the 512-Channel Magnetograph and Spectromagnetograph used to generate synoptic charts of the Sun’s magnetic field. It provides measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field, which are crucial for linking the evolution of PCFs with polar magnetic field reversals.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The magnetograms are obtained by the 512-Channel Magnetograph and Spectromagnetograph at the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP)...”
   
#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Starting from February 1975 (Carrington rotation No. 1625 onward)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “NSO/KP provides synoptic chats starting from 1975 February (Carrington rotations No. 1625) in FITS format.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated  
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight magnetic field strength near the north and south poles  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The averaged magnetic ﬁeld strength, in the direction of line-of-sight (LOS), near the north and south poles can be measured from these synoptic maps.”
- **Additional Comments**: The synoptic charts from NSO/KP serve as a reference for the polar magnetic field conditions that correlate with the PCF migrations.

### 4. Magnetograms from MDI on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard SOHO is used to obtain magnetograms that yield measurements of the radial polar magnetic fields. These magnetograms have a high cadence and complement the ground-based NSO/KP observations.

   - **Supporting Quote**: While a specific date range isn’t given for MDI data, it is used in conjunction with other instruments to provide polar field measurements.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms measuring magnetic fields)  
- **Physical Observable**: Radial component of the polar magnetic fields (converted from line-of-sight measurements)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For MDI and HMI data, the radial polar ﬁelds are provided, in a cadence as high as 720 s.”
- **Additional Comments**: The cadence of the MDI observations is as high as 720 s, which enables detailed tracking of the magnetic field evolution during the observation periods.

### 5. Magnetograms from HMI on board SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO provides high-quality magnetograms with measurements of the radial polar magnetic fields, particularly above 50° latitude. HMI data are instrumental in correlating the PCF migrations with the polar magnetic field changes.
