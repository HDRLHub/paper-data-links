## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a multiwavelength, stereoscopic study of the 1 May 2013 solar flare and its accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME). Observations from several space-based platforms—spanning X-rays, EUV, and radio wavelengths—help disentangle thermal from non‐thermal emission and reveal the dynamics in the high corona and chromospheric footpoints. Detailed imaging spectroscopy (using RHESSI and Mars Odyssey/HEND) and EUV imaging (from SDO/AIA and the two STEREO spacecraft) are combined with radio measurements (from Nobeyama Radioheliograph) and complementary soft X‑ray data (from GOES and LASCO) to characterize the event’s geometry, timing, energy spectra, and plasma properties. The paper focuses on key time periods around the flare peak (approximately 02:32 UT), when well‐defined thermal (4–8 keV) and non‐thermal (13–30 keV) X‑ray sources were observed, and uses stereoscopic views to constrain the CME geometry and filament eruption.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI provided high‐resolution X‑ray imaging spectroscopy of both thermal and non‑thermal emissions. It was essential for isolating coronal X‑ray sources (free from contaminating footpoint emission) because the flare was partially occulted from Earth.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The RHESSI 10–30 keV peak occurred at 02:32:28UT and the 4–8 keV peak was slightly delayed at 02:34:15UT …” and “RHESSI imaging … showed both thermal and non‑thermal sources.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Thermal X‑ray Emission
- **Time Range**: The thermal source was observed over a duration of approximately 5.5 minutes starting slightly after 02:32 UT (with details of centroid motion noted from about 02:32 UT onward).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “After 2:20UT, RHESSI detected a second fainter source above the limb … The thermal source was visible for 5.5 minutes …”
- **Wavelength(s)**: X‑rays in the 4–8 keV energy band.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For reference we made an image of the thermal source in the further restricted 6–8 keV energy range…”
- **Physical Observable**: Thermal plasma emission properties (temperature, emission measure, source size, and density).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Fitting a single temperature model gave the temperature and emission measure … peaking around 11 MK and with derived density around 10^9 cm^−3.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Non‑thermal X‑ray Emission
- **Time Range**: A distinct non‑thermal burst was imaged by integrating over 02:32:03–02:33:21 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… we reconstructed a single image averaged over the duration of the non‑thermal burst (02:32:03–02:33:21UT).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: X‑rays in the 13–30 keV band (with non‑thermal emission dominating above 13 keV).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “From the RHESSI spectral analysis … emissions above 13 keV were purely non‑thermal.”
- **Physical Observable**: The spatial extent, brightness, and spectral index of the non‑thermal (accelerated electron) source.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The non‑thermal source was clearly outside the CME core … with a FWHM of 110±30".”

### 2. SDO/AIA (Solar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging Assembly)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA provided high‑resolution EUV imaging in multiple wavelength channels. Although the hot thermal X‑ray source seen by RHESSI was not directly observed in some AIA filters (due to delayed ionization), AIA images in filters such as 131 Å, 304 Å, 193 Å, and 94 Å were used to capture the multi‑thermal structure of the CME and evolving plasma features.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Emissions below ∼10 keV revealed a hot, extended (11 MK …) thermal source … which was not detected in SDO/AIA’s 131 Å filter.”
  
#### Data Collection Period: EUV Imaging During the Flare
- **Time Range**: The EUV observations correspond to the flare period around the main event (∼02:30 UT to post‑flare phases, with pre‑flare increases and post‑flare loop development noted, e.g., candidate loops at 03:00 UT).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “EUV views from the occulted perspectives … showed varying amounts of increase in the hour leading up to the flare … Post‑flare loops were slow to emerge, with the first candidates being seen at 03:00UT by STEREO‑A.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å, 304 Å, 193 Å, and 94 Å.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… the hot peak in AIA 131Å’s response function …” and “… when the observed radio contours were overlaid on those from AIA’s 50,000 K 304 Å channel …”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV brightness, morphology of coronal loops, and signatures of CME structure.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In this event, cold and hot X‑ray source appeared at slightly lower altitude …” (by comparison with the AIA 304 Å images showing the expanding bubble).

### 3. STEREO-A (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Ahead)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO-A provided an occulted perspective of the flare which allowed viewing of plasma above the flaring region that was not visible from Earth. Its EUV observations captured the erupting filament structures and early post-flare phenomena.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “STEREO-A saw the flare as occulted by 27° behind STEREO-A’s east limb … and shortly after the flare peak, STEREO-A presented a beautiful view of an erupting filament …”
  
#### Data Collection Period: Filament Eruption and Post‑flare Loops
- **Time Range**: Observations began shortly after the flare peak (around 02:32 UT) and continued into the post‑flare phase (with first candidate post‑flare loops seen at approximately 03:00 UT).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Shortly after the flare peak, STEREO-A presented a beautiful view …” and “Post‑flare loops were slow to emerge, with the first candidates being seen at 03:00UT by STEREO-A.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV channels (specific wavelengths are not explicitly detailed, but typical STEREO/SECCHI channels are used).
- **Physical Observable**: Filament eruption morphology and the evolution of post‑flare loops.

### 4. STEREO-B (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory – Behind)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO-B’s SECCHI instrument provided a full‑disk view of the active region and flare from a vantage point where it was not occulted. Its images were used for flare magnitude estimation and for observing evolving coronal structures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The active region that produced the May 1, 2013 flare was fully visible to STEREO‑B’s SECCHI …” and “… the 286" length of the saturated portion of the peak STEREO‑B image at 02:30:57UT gave a flare class of M7.”
  
#### Data Collection Period: Flare Magnitude Estimation
- **Time Range**: A key saturated image was recorded at 02:30:57 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Following the method of Chertok et al. (2015), the 286" length of the saturated portion of the peak STEREO‑B image at 02:30:57UT gave a flare class of M7.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV (exact channel not stated but consistent with SECCHI imaging).
- **Physical Observable**: Saturation length used to estimate the flare’s soft X‑ray class.

### 5. Mars Odyssey HEND (High Energy Neutron Detector)

### 6. Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - NoRH provided radio imaging of the event at microwave frequencies (17 and 34 GHz) with high time resolution, capturing a bubble of cold thermal material expanding over the limb.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Imaging at 17 GHz using data from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) showed much stronger emissions … Ten‑second cadence images, made at both 17 and 34 GHz …”
  
#### Data Collection Period: Microwave Observations During the Flare
- **Time Range**: While explicit UT times are not given, the NoRH observations were made concurrently with the flare and subsequent expansion phases, overlapping the X‑ray and EUV observations during the main event.
