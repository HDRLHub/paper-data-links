Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to construct queries for the SWICS instrument on board the ACE satellite and the OMNI dataset. The SWICS instrument has two distinct data collection periods, one before and one after hardware degradation. The OMNI dataset provides one-hourly helium and hydrogen ratios but does not specify a time range. We will use the provided time ranges and instruments to construct our queries.
