## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates solar coronal jets in the polar coronal holes that extend from the solar surface to several solar radii. The authors combine ground‐based white-light eclipse imaging with spaceborne extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray observations, as well as coronagraph data, to track the evolution of jets and assess whether ordinary polar jets can ultimately escape as part of the solar wind. The study uses a multi-site eclipse observation covering a 70‐minute period (approximately from 17:18 UT to 18:28 UT on 2017 August 21) and compares these data to complementary observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Hinode, and the LASCO C2 coronagraph onboard SOHO. Detailed time stamps (e.g., start, peak, and subsequent observation times) as well as wavelengths (e.g., 211 Å, 193 Å) and physical observables (white-light brightness changes, EUV intensity, soft X-ray fluxes) are used for the analysis.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. White-Light Eclipse Observations (Ground-based)
- **General Comments**:
   - These observations were performed during the total solar eclipse on 2017 August 21 by a collaboration of professionals and amateurs using small refractor telescopes coupled with single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras. The composite white-light images cover the corona from just above the solar limb out to several solar radii. The flexibility in exposure times allowed creation of wide dynamic range images that capture both the low-corona and high-altitude details.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “At the total solar eclipse on 2017 August 21, professionals and amateurs in Japan collaboratively performed a multi-site observation program… The observations were done with small refractor telescopes and single lens reflex cameras, which covers up to several solar radii of the white-light corona.”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: Multi-site Eclipse Imaging**
   - **Time Range**: 17:18 UT to 18:28 UT on 2017 August 21  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The data covers a time period of about 70 minutes… Table 1 summarizes the eclipse observations” and the details in Table 1 list observation times from 17:18 UT (Salem, Oregon) through 18:28 UT (Nashville, Tennessee).
   - **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light)  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “In the time-series white-light images taken at the eclipse…” 
   - **Physical Observable**: The brightness and structural evolution of the solar corona including changes due to jet brightenings and darkenings.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The composite images... are calibrated so that we could find the changes in the corona during the observations.”
   - **Additional Comments**: The different observing sites (with instruments such as Nikon D810a, Canon EOS6D, Nikon D500, Canon EOS5DmkII, etc.) ensured that the evolution of jets could be tracked continuously, compensating for periodical weather gaps.

### 2. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA provides high-cadence, full-Sun EUV images of the low corona with a spatial sampling of 0.6″ per pixel (in full resolution) and also in a reduced “synoptic series” (2.4″ pixel⁻¹). It observes in various UV–EUV wavelengths sensitive to different temperature ranges (from 0.05 MK to 20 MK). It was crucial in identifying the onset and evolution of the EUV jets that are later seen as white-light jets during the eclipse.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The AIA of the SDO takes full-Sun images including the low corona up to about 1.2 R⊙ every 12 s with the spatial sampling of 0″.6 pixel−1 using various filters in the UV–EUV wavelengths…”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: EUV Jet Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Approximate observations span from 16:00 UT to 19:00 UT on 2017 August 21, with jet events clearly noted between 16:43 UT and 18:01 UT.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “We checked the 211 Å and 193 Å images taken with the AIA around the eclipse time, 16:00–19:00 UT…” and specific jets have start and peak times such as 16:43 UT (Jet 1 start) and 18:01 UT (Jet 5 peak).
   - **Wavelength(s)**: EUV filters at 211 Å and 193 Å  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “…the corresponding EUV jets for all the eclipse jets on the images taken with the 211 Å filter (… and/or the 193 Å filter).”
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity enhancements corresponding to jet brightenings that are indicative of heated plasma and jet dynamics.
     - **Supporting Quote**: “…the EUV jets, which have different durations, we visually determined the ‘peak time’… representing the time when the EUV jets were observed.”
   - **Additional Comments**: The high cadence (every 12 s, with synoptic series every 2 minutes) allowed detailed tracking of the onset, evolution, and decay of the jets.

### 3. X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - The XRT obtains soft X-ray images of the solar corona with a field of view covering the full Sun, enabling the detection of jet activity in X-rays. It is used as a standard tool to detect coronal jets and to compare their occurrence in soft X-rays with the EUV and eclipse observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…the soft X-ray observation has been a standard method to detect coronal jets, and therefore, we checked the data taken with the X-Ray Telescope (XRT; Golub et al. 2007) on board Hinode.”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: Soft X-ray Imaging**
   - **Time Range**: Partial high-resolution images were taken until 16:38 UT, and then full-Sun images with a reduced resolution were taken from 17:10 UT onward on 2017 August 21.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “However, until 16:38 UT the XRT were taking partial images around the north pole with the full resolution… then it took the full-Sun images with a reduced resolution (… ) at 16:43 UT and from 17:10 UT on.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-rays (using the “Al-poly” filter for extended temperature sensitivity)  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “…we checked the images taken with the ‘Al-poly’ filter…”
   - **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray brightness enhancements of jets, used to gauge the energization and thermal properties of the jet plasma.
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The soft X-ray jets plotted on a soft X-ray image… and brightness values measured on the soft X-ray images…”
   - **Additional Comments**: Although the XRT coverage was limited both temporally and spatially (with a gap just before the eclipse), it provided an independent means of confirming jet occurrences particularly for the more energetic events.

### 4. LASCO C2 Coronagraph on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 coronagraph is designed to image the solar corona in white light from about 2 R⊙ up to 6 R⊙. It provides a complementary view to the eclipse observations by extending the field of view farther out into the corona. Its use in the study helps track the later phases of jets that extend to high altitudes.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Jets are also checked in the images taken with the LASCO C2 coronagraph of the SOHO. The field of view of the LASCO C2 covers up to 6 R⊙…”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: Coronagraph Imaging of Jets**
   - **Time Range**: Observations with LASCO C2 during the eclipse period have reference times in the study; for example, reference images at 17:48 UT (for Jet 5), 17:24 UT (for Jet 6) and subsequent images up to nearly 19:12 UT are mentioned.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “…the C2 diﬀerence images, whose reference is the image at 17:24 UT… at 18:12 UT, about one hour later than the peak time of the EUV jet…”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging by means of Thomson scattering; the instrument observes the K-corona structure.
     - **Supporting Quote**: “…the white-light corona extending farther than the eclipse image” and “The brightness of the K+F corona…”
   - **Physical Observable**: The spatial extension and brightness distribution of the white-light corona including the jet structures.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The extension of the length of the jet on the eclipse images gives the velocity… and the LASCO C2 images also show a brightening.”
   - **Additional Comments**: Although the occulting disk in LASCO C2 prevents viewing the inner corona (below ~2 R⊙), the instrument is essential for confirming the high-altitude propagation and expansion of jets as they merge into the solar wind.
