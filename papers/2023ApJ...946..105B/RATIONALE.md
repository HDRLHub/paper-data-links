produce the script. We need to focus on querying data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board NASAâ€™s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for specific time periods. Given the context, the data required is the photospheric magnetic field across several specific time ranges (April of even-numbered years from 2012 to 2020). We will use the `a.Instrument("HMI")` and `a.Physobs("LOS_magnetic_field")` attributes for the query. The time ranges will be constructed for each April of the specified years. Since the exact wavelength isn't specified, we will not include a wavelength attribute in our query. The script will be structured to query each of these periods separately and display the results.
