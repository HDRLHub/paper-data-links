## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how a weak, “stealth” coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 2016 October 8–9 produced an unexpectedly intense geomagnetic storm at Earth. The study combines remote sensing observations from multiple spaceborne instruments and in situ measurements to track the CME’s evolution from the low corona to 1 au. Key instruments include SDO/AIA for EUV imaging of the corona, STEREO A (with its COR2, HI1, and HI2 imagers) for multi-angle coronagraph observations and time–elongation mapping, SOHO/LASCO for white-light coronagraph images, and Wind for in situ solar wind and magnetic field measurements at Earth. The paper also uses data from the ground-based GONG network (acknowledged in the paper) and employs modeling (PFSS, ENLIL, and a Grad–Shafranov reconstruction) in understanding the CME propagation and its geo-effectiveness.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:

   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "PFSS extrapolation of global coronal magnetic ﬁelds mapped onto the AIA 211 ˚A image at 22:36 UT on 2016 October 8."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 211 Å (extreme ultraviolet)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "AIA 211 ˚A image"
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission from the solar corona to identify coronal holes and dimming regions (related to stealth CME source investigation).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "The open magnetic ﬁeld lines together with the AIA image suggest that there are mainly two coronal holes near the solar equator."

### 2. STEREO A Instruments on board the STEREO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO A provided multiple vantage point observations of the CME. Its suite of instruments (COR2, HI1, and HI2) delivered coronagraph images and heliospheric imager data, which were critical in tracking the CME’s evolution from 2016 October 8 to 9 and constructing time–elongation maps to derive kinematics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Tracing back to the Sun, we ﬁnd a CME observed by STEREO A and SOHO simultaneously during October 8 to 9."  
   - "STEREO A was 142.9◦ east of the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.96 au from the Sun, and caught a sided view of this CME in the western part of COR2."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coronagraph Observations with COR2
- **Time Range**: Observations during October 8 to October 9, 2016  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "It was ﬁrst seen in the northeastern sector of SOHO/LASCO and evolved into a halo CME on October 9." (implying simultaneous STEREO A observations capture this evolution)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible coronagraph imaging)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - (Implicit from usage of coronagraph images; no explicit wavelength is given in the text.)
- **Physical Observable**: Scattered white light from coronal electrons (to determine CME morphology, direction, and kinematics) via the GCS modeling.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "The GCS model can determine the direction of propagation, ﬂux rope orientation and height based on the coronagraph images."
- **Additional Comments**: The COR2 instrument onboard STEREO A, with a field of view of 0.7–4◦ around the Sun, provided crucial imaging of the CME’s early evolution.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Heliospheric Imaging with HI1 and HI2
- **Time Range**: During the CME’s propagation phase after October 8–9 up until its predicted arrival near Earth (tracked continuously in the time–elongation map)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "By stacking the running-difference images of COR2, HI1, and HI2 within a slit along the ecliptic plane, we obtain the time-elongation map."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (continuation of broadband observations for heliospheric imaging)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - (The text does not specify a particular wavelength, it only describes the white-light imaging characteristics of HI1 and HI2.)
- **Physical Observable**: The time evolution of the CME’s leading edge as tracked by changes in elongation angle; used to derive radial distance and speed profiles via the HM approximation.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "The CME kinematics from HM approximation within 100 R⊙ are shown in Figure 5."
- **Additional Comments**: HI1 and HI2 have larger fields of view (20° square for HI1 and 70° for HI2) which allow tracking the CME over a large distance in interplanetary space.

### 3. SOHO/LASCO on board the SOHO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/LASCO provided white-light coronagraph images that were used to initially identify the CME. Its observations, in combination with those from STEREO A, allowed the application of the GCS model to retrieve the CME’s three-dimensional structure.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "It was ﬁrst seen in the northeastern sector of SOHO/LASCO and evolved into a halo CME on October 9."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Coronagraph Imaging
- **Time Range**: October 8–9, 2016  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Tracing back to the Sun, we ﬁnd a CME observed by STEREO A and SOHO simultaneously during October 8 to 9."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light observations (broadband coronagraph imaging)  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - (The observations are described in the context of white-light coronagraph images; no specific wavelength is provided.)
- **Physical Observable**: Intensity of scattered sunlight from coronal free electrons used to detect and characterize the CME.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "The GCS model ﬁts the CME observations from the two vantage points very well..."
- **Additional Comments**: SOHO/LASCO (specifically seen in C2 images as mentioned in Figure 1) was instrumental in determining the CME’s evolution and morphology in the low corona.

### 4. Wind (In Situ Measurements) near Earth
- **General Comments**:
   - Wind spacecraft provided in situ measurements of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters at 1 au. These observations were key to identifying the shock, the sheath region, and the magnetic cloud (ICME) associated with the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 7 shows the in situ measurements at Wind."  
   - "A shock passed Wind around 21:15 UT on October 12..."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Shock and Sheath Observations
- **Time Range**: Shock arrival at approximately 21:15 UT on October 12, 2016  
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "A shock passed Wind around 21:15 UT on October 12..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ plasma and magnetic field detectors measure physical quantities directly, not at specific wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Plasma density, bulk speed, proton temperature, magnetic field strength and its components (including the southward magnetic field that contributed to the geomagnetic storm).
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Typical signatures of magnetic cloud are observed, such as depressed proton temperatures, enhanced magnetic ﬁelds, and long-lasting smooth rotation of the ﬁeld components."  
     - "The average speed in the sheath between the shock and ejecta is about 437 km s–1..."
- **Additional Comments**: The in situ data provided the basis for the Grad–Shafranov reconstruction to analyze the ICME flux-rope structure, underpinning the explanation for the unexpected geo-effectiveness.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Magnetic Cloud and Flux Rope Interval
- **Time Range**: During the main ICME interval detected from October 12 to October 14, 2016  
   - **Supporting Quote**:

- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Enhanced magnetic fields (with a maximum inside the ICME up to 25 nT and a southward component reaching –21 nT) and flux rope structure details.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Within the ICME, the magnetic ﬁeld strength is as high as 25 nT while the southward field component reaches –21 nT."  
     - "Figure 8 gives the reconstruction results, which show how the magnetic ﬁeld features control the geomagnetic storm activity."
- **Additional Comments**: The in situ observations allowed the identification of the compression region where the CME was bracketed by slow and fast solar winds, leading to an unusually enhanced magnetic field.
