1. IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - IRIS is the primary instrument for UV burst studies in this paper. It provides both high‐resolution slit spectra and simultaneous slit‐jaw images (e.g., the 1400 Å channel) that reveal intense, compact, transient brightenings (“IRIS bombs”).  
     - Its spectral capability (e.g. viewing the Si IV doublet at 1393.76 and 1402.77 Å) gives details of line broadening, Doppler shifts, and line–profile morphology.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “The IBs were identified by Peter et al. (2014) from a 140×170 arcsec² IRIS raster scan taken on 2013 September 24 during 11:44–12:04 UT.”  
   - **Data Collection Periods**:  
     - **Data Collection Period 1: IRIS Raster Scan of an Active Region**

       - **Supporting Quote**: “The IBs were identified … from a 140×170 arcsec² IRIS raster scan taken on 2013 September 24 during 11:44–12:04 UT.”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily observations in the Si IV lines at 1393.76 and 1402.77 Å (with contributions sometimes from the continuum in the 1400 Å slit–jaw images).  
       - **Physical Observable**: Spectral line profiles (intensity, Doppler shifts, and broadening) that diagnose UV bursts and evidence of magnetic reconnection.  
     - **Data Collection Period 2: Sit-and-Stare and High Cadence Imaging**  
       - **Time Range(s)**:  
         - A sit‐and‐stare observation on October 23, 2013 between 00:41 and 00:51 UT (see Figure 5).  
         - A rapid–cadence dataset beginning at 09:08 UT on October 16, 2016, with the fastest cadence (1.7 seconds) in the SJI 1400 Å channel (see discussion regarding flickering light curves in Figure 3).  
       - **Supporting Quote**: “One data–set beginning at 09:08 UT on 2016 October 16 that has this cadence for the SJI 1400 Å channel and contains bursts.”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Again, the 1400 Å band dominated by Si IV emission.  
       - **Physical Observable**: Temporal variability (“flickering”) of burst intensities and profile evolution over a time span that in one example extended for 36 minutes (as in the burst of October 24, 2014).

       - **Time Range**: For example, a burst observed on October 24, 2014 around 23:02 UT with a total lifetime of 36 minutes (with sub‐bursts repeating roughly every 7 seconds).  
       - **Supporting Quote**: “The burst image drifted through the IRIS slit during the observation, and the full lifetime derived from SJI images was 36 minutes.”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Si IV λ1402.8 (and nearby Si IV 1393.76 seen in absorption blends).  
       - **Physical Observable**: Evolution of Si IV profiles (line broadening related to non-thermal speeds) and complex absorption features that indicate cool material along the line of sight.
