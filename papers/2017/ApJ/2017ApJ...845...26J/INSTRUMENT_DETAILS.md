## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates a large-scale, ejective solar eruption that occurred on 2014 December 18 from active region NOAA 12241, resulting in a three-ribbon flare (two parallel ribbons plus a quasi-circular ribbon). The investigation utilizes multiwavelength imaging and magnetic field data primarily from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) instruments—AIA and HMI—alongside soft X-ray and hard X-ray observations from GOES and RHESSI, respectively. The event is placed in context with precise observational time period: data spans before, during, and after the flare onset, with critical activity from about 21:30 UT on 2014-12-18 through to ~02:00 UT on 2014-12-19. The primary observables are flare ribbon development, flux rope formation and eruption, and associated CME. The findings critically depend on direct analysis of AIA EUV/UV/visible images, RHESSI X-ray imaging, HMI magnetograms, and GOES X-ray time profiles during specified intervals.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/AIA provided multiwavelength imaging data (EUV, UV, visible) essential for tracking the eruption's morphology, the development of flare ribbons, flux rope evolution, and related dynamics, specifically for the 2014-12-18 event from AR NOAA 12241.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "For the present work we have examined AIA observations at all available EUV channels: 304, 131, 171, 193, 211, 335, and 94 ˚A, and also in UV at 1600 and 1700 ˚A, and in visible light at 4500 ˚A."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Main Eruptive Event and Flare Morphology
- **Time Range**: 2014-12-18 21:30 UT – 2014-12-19 02:00 UT (flare evolution, with detailed frames from 21:30 UT on 2014 December 18)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "The background image is a SDO/AIA 304 ˚A full disk image from 21:30:07 UT on 2014 December 18 (Fig- ure 1(a))."

    - "SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A images show that the parallel ribbons began no latter than 21:38 UT, and they were essentially fully developed by ∼21:50 UT. The circular ribbon on the other hand did not start until ∼21:52 UT, and was not fully developed prior to ∼21:55 UT."

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/HMI provided high-cadence, full-disk line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms used for mapping the evolving magnetic topology at the flare site, identifying polarity inversion lines, footpoints of loops, regions of flux cancellation, and the magnetic context for ribbons and flux rope anchors.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) is another instrument on board SDO. It provides line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld maps of the whole face of the Sun with a temporal cadence of 45 s and with pixel size of 0.5′′."

    - "Inspection of the SDO/HMI photospheric magnetic ﬁeld movie (see animation accompa- nying Figure 5) of the area shows rapid evolution, with continuous ﬂux cancellation and shearing motions; in particular, the red-circled area in Figure 5(f) shows cancelation occur- ring in the hours prior to the onset of ﬂaring, with an episode of cancelation between the positive-polarity patch with adjacent negative-polarity ﬂux starting at about 20:15 UT."

### Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
- **General Comments**:
  - RHESSI provided hard X-ray imaging (including at high energies such as 25-50 keV), which was used to pinpoint the flare energy release, footpoint brightenings, and the evolution of X-ray sources relative to the flare ribbons and ribbons timing; image reconstruction used the PIXON algorithm with ~20 s integration.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "For observing the X-ray-coronal and footpoint sources during the ﬂare we use data from the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002), where we used the PIXON algorithm for image reconstruction with an integration time of around 20 s."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare Hard X-ray Imaging of Ribbons
- **Time Range**: 2014-12-18 21:41 UT – 2014-12-18 22:10 UT (during ribbon development, throughout flare rise and peak)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "The green contours in panel (c) image the RHESSI X-ray intensity in the energy range 25-50 keV, generated with the PIXON algorithm. The contour levels are 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the peak intensity, and the integration time is 20 s."
    - "Moreover, we also observed RHESSI 25–50 keV X-ray source on one of the two ribbons (see green contours in Figure 8(c))."
    - "The RHESSI X–ray sources have also been observed during this phase in the region between the parallel ribbons (see Figures 8(a)–(c))."
- **Wavelength(s)**: X-rays, specifically 3–6 keV, 6–12 keV, 12–25 keV, 25–50 keV
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "the RHESSI X-ray proﬁles at 3-6 keV (pink), 6-12 keV (red), 12-25 keV (green), and 25-50 (blue) keV are overplotted."
    - "The green contours in panel (c) image the RHESSI X-ray intensity in the energy range 25-50 keV"
- **Physical Observable**: Hard X-ray emission at flare footpoints and loop tops (flare energy release, timing and site of electron precipitation correlating with flare ribbons)
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "Moreover, we also observed RHESSI 25–50 keV X-ray source on one of the two ribbons (see green contours in Figure 8(c)). These observations are consistent with the standard ﬂare model, with runaway tether-cutting reconnection occurring below the erupting ﬂux rope and with charged particles accelerated at the reconnection site and ﬂowing downward along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and striking the lower chromosphere to emit hard X-rays and heat the ﬂare ribbons."

### Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/LASCO imaging was used to verify the occurrence of the associated CME and its evolution into a halo CME following the 18 December 2014 event, despite data gaps.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "Figure 13 shows a SOHO/LASCO white light coronagraph image of the CME at 01:04:42 UT on 2014 December 19. Unfortunately, due to a data gap, only a few images are available and so the CME was not observed at full cadence."

  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "Unfortunately, due to a data gap, only a few images are available and so the CME was not observed at full cadence."
