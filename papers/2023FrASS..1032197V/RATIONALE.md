produce the script. We need to construct a query that fetches data from the K-Coronagraph (K-Cor) at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) focusing on the specific time range and the physical observables related to CME kinematics. Given the context, we will query for the entire available time range from November 2014 to September 2022, and since the physical observable directly related to CME kinematics isn't specified in the VSO interface, we will focus on the intensity data which is available. The script will be structured to reflect these requirements clearly and concisely.
