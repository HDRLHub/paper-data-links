## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the observations of the sunskirting asteroid (3200) Phaethon, which is known for its anomalous brightening and the production of an antisunward tail near each perihelion passage. These phenomena were previously attributed to the ejection of micron-sized dust grains. However, recent observations using the STEREO HI1 and SOHO LASCO coronagraphs during the 2022 apparition suggest that the brightening and tail are due to the release of sodium atoms, which resonantly fluoresce at specific wavelengths. The paper analyzes data collected over 18 apparitions from 1997 to 2022, demonstrating that the observed brightening is consistent with sodium emission rather than dust, using photometric colors, tail morphology, and light curve patterns as evidence.

## Instrumentation Details

### STEREO-A HI1 and STEREO-B HI1
- **General Comments**:
   - The Heliospheric Imagers (HI1) on the twin STEREO spacecraft are used to observe Phaethon near perihelion. These instruments have a fixed bandpass filter, which has degraded over time, increasing sensitivity to sodium D line emission.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of Phaethon's activity near perihelion
- **Time Range**: Multiple periods from 1997 to 2022, specific dates vary by apparition
- **Wavelength(s)**: 615–740 nm (nominal preflight values, actual sensitivity includes sodium D lines due to filter degradation)
- **Physical Observable**: Sodium D line emission, indicated by anomalous brightening and tail formation
- **Additional Comments**: Used updated photometric calibrations and subtracted field stars for enhanced sensitivity. Observations include both STEREO-A and STEREO-B until the latter ceased operations in 2014.

### SOHO LASCO C2 and C3
- **General Comments**:
   - The Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraphs (C2 and C3) on SOHO are used to observe Phaethon's activity near the Sun. These instruments can use different bandpass filters and have observed thousands of objects near the Sun.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed observations during the 2022 apparition
- **Time Range**: May 13–17, 2022
- **Wavelength(s)**: C2 and C3 Orange filters (540–620 nm), C3 Clear filter (530–840 nm), and special observations with Blue filters blocking sodium D emission
- **Physical Observable**: Sodium D line emission, analyzed through photometric bandpasses
- **Additional Comments**: Special observing sequences were scheduled to capture high-resolution data during Phaethon's peak activity period. The observations confirmed the presence of sodium rather than dust in the tail.
