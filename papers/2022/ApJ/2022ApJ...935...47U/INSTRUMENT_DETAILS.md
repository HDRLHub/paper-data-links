## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a new methodology called Keplerian Optical Dynamics Analysis (KODA) for analyzing the dynamics of dense, cool material in the solar corona. The study focuses on the prominence eruption of June 7, 2011, observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The research aims to track the motion of plasma blobs and evaluate the forces acting on them, particularly the magnetic forces. The study provides quantitative estimates of magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob masses and energies during the eruption.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA instrument on SDO was used to capture images of the solar corona in multiple wavelengths. The study specifically utilized the 193 Å channel for its high contrast and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, which facilitated the tracking of falling prominence material.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For this study, we analyzed a sequence of 193 Å solar coronal images obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) spacecraft covering the time interval between 05:40 UT and 08:00 UT on 2011 June 7."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Initial Eruption and Rising Phase
- **Time Range**: 05:40 UT – 06:22 UT on June 7, 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For this study, we analyzed a sequence of 193 Å solar coronal images obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) spacecraft covering the time interval between 05:40 UT and 08:00 UT on 2011 June 7."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To track the falling prominence material, we opted to use 193 Å SDO/AIA images due to their high contrast and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, which enabled us to obtain well-defined determinations of the shape and position of the falling prominence pieces."
- **Physical Observable**: Dynamics of rising prominence material, magnetic forces
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetic pressure and energy are strongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while the dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the subsequent falling phases."
- **Additional Comments**: The initial phase involved the prominence material rising and interacting with the coronal magnetic field, leading to significant magnetic forces.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Falling Phase
- **Time Range**: 06:22 UT – 08:00 UT on June 7, 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The M2.5 flare that occurred during the studied time period as part of the eruption was of sufficient magnitude to trigger an onboard flare observation mode from 06:22 UT to 07:57 UT, in which the AIA instrument alternates between normal 2-s exposures and adaptive exposures as short as 0.12 s."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To track the falling prominence material, we opted to use 193 Å SDO/AIA images due to their high contrast and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, which enabled us to obtain well-defined determinations of the shape and position of the falling prominence pieces."
- **Physical Observable**: Dynamics of falling prominence material, magnetic forces
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the subsequent falling phases."
- **Additional Comments**: This phase involved the prominence material falling back to the solar surface, with the AIA instrument capturing images at a 12-s cadence, alternating between normal and reduced exposures.
