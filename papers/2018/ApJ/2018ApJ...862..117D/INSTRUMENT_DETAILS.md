# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a series of solar dynamic events observed on 18 July 2014 using multiple instruments. A small bipolar active region (NOAA 12119) emerged within a pre‐existing negative polarity area encircled by a circular, quiescent filament. Within eight hours of the onset of flux emergence, observations captured a partial splitting of the filament and two consecutive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study utilizes high-cadence extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, photospheric magnetic field measurements, and coronagraph observations to identify the timing of bright loops, reconnection signatures, flare loops, and the CMEs. In parallel, the authors use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to reproduce the reconnection processes and subsequent filament-splitting and eruptions. The observational time stamps are critical for linking the formation and evolution of the reconnection sites with the initiation of eruptions.

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA is an extreme ultraviolet imager used to capture high-resolution images of the solar corona. It provides observations in multiple EUV wavelengths that reveal plasma structures, reconnection-related brightenings, and flare loops.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) were used to identify structures and connectivities...” (Section 2.1)

#### Data Collection Period 1: Early Interaction and Reconnection Signatures
- **Time Range**: 05:12 UT, 18 July 2014
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “As the new ﬂux started to emerge, it immediately began to interact with the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld, as is apparent from the formation of bright loops in the AIA 171 ˚A images as early as 05:12 UT.” (Section 2.2)
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å 
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Shown are HMI magnetograms (left) and AIA 171 ˚A images (right)…” (Figure 1 caption)
- **Physical Observable**: Bright loops and emerging connectivities indicative of magnetic reconnection.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Bright streaks … suggesting new magnetic connectivities” (Section 2.2)

#### Data Collection Period 2: Pre- and Post-Eruption Imaging of Flare Loops
- **Time Range**: Images captured at ~07:04 UT (pre-eruption stage) and at 08:59 UT (post-eruption stage) on 18 July 2014
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Before the ﬁrst eruption, at 07:04 UT on 18 July 2014…” (Figure 4, panels a–c) and “Shortly after the ﬁrst eruption, at 08:59 UT. The ﬂare loops produced by the eruption can be clearly seen in AIA 171 and 193 ˚A images…” (Section 2.3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å and 193 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…ﬂare loops produced by this eruption can be clearly seen in AIA 171 and 193 ˚A images…” (Section 2.3)
- **Physical Observable**: Flare loops, arcade brightening, and signatures of post-reconnection relaxation.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “The bright loops seen in Figure 4(c) before the eruption are interpreted as these small loops...” (Section 2.3)

### 2. Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field measurements and magnetograms used to study the evolution of the emerging bipole and its interaction with the pre-existing magnetic field.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “…photospheric line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld measurements, provided by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) were used to calculate the magnetic ﬂux of the emerging bipole.” (Section 2.1)
  
#### Data Collection Period: Magnetic Field Observations
- **Time Range**: 
   - 03:30 UT on 18 July 2014 (initial magnetogram showing the quiescent filament) and an observer’s view rotated to 05:55 UT on 18 July 2014.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “The quiescent ﬁlament (shown in Figure 1(b) at 03:30 UT on 18 July 2014)…” (Section 2.2) and “All images shown in Figs. 1 and 4 below were rotated to the observer’s view at 05:55 UT on July 18…” (Section 2.1)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided; HMI typically observes in the visible spectrum (Fe I 6173 Å), though this detail is not mentioned in the text.
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field distribution and flux evolution.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...were used to calculate the magnetic ﬂux of the emerging bipole.” (Section 2.1)

### 3. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) C2 on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO C2 is a white-light coronagraph used to detect and monitor CMEs as they propagate through the solar corona. It fields observations that capture the outer extensions of eruptive events.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The CME associated with this eruption is ﬁrst seen in data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) C2 on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) at ≈09:35.” (Section 2.3)

#### Data Collection Period 1: First Eruption CME Observation
- **Time Range**: ≈09:35 UT on 18 July 2014
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “The CME associated with this eruption is ﬁrst seen in data from the … LASCO C2 on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) at ≈09:35.” (Section 2.3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light images (typical coronagraph observations)
- **Physical Observable**: Propagation of the CME ejecta as it enters the coronagraph’s field of view.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...CME … first seen … in data from LASCO C2…” (Section 2.3)

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “The CME associated with the second eruption enters the LASCO C2 ﬁeld of view at ≈11:50 UT.” (Section 2.4)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light images
- **Physical Observable**: CME kinematics and evolution; noted to be faster, possibly due to reduced overlying coronal magnetic tension.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “It appears to travel faster than the ﬁrst eruption, which may be due to a removal of some of the overlying coronal ﬁeld by the ﬁrst eruption.” (Section 2.4)
