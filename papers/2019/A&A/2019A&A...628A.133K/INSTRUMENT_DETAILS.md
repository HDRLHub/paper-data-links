## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper develops a theoretical model for the damping of linear standing slow magnetoacoustic waves in solar coronal loops. In the model the authors include the effects of field‐aligned thermal conduction together with a wave-induced misbalance between radiative cooling and an unspecified heating mechanism. They compare the theoretically derived damping (and even amplification) of the oscillations with properties of waves detected in the solar corona. In particular, the paper focuses on those oscillations that were initially detected by the SoHO/SUMER instrument (often called “SUMER oscillations”) and subsequently studied in a number of observational works. The analysis is used to constrain the dependence of the coronal heating function on the local plasma density and temperature.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SoHO/SUMER
- **General Comments**:
   - This ultraviolet spectrometer on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) was the first to detect standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in coronal loops. These “SUMER oscillations” are identified via rapidly decaying periodic Doppler shifts in coronal emission lines.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Standing slow waves are usually refereed to as SUMER oscillations, after the instrument used in their ﬁrst detection (SoHO/SUMER, see Wang et al. 2002) and interpretation (Ofman & Wang 2002). SUMER oscillations still remain a subject of intensive studies."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of Non‑flaring Fan Loops
- **Time Range**: 
   - Wave period ~27 minutes and damping time ~45 minutes.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "For example, standing slow waves in non‑flaring fan loops, with the periods of 27 min, damping time about 45 min, and the phase speed corresponding to the plasma temperature of about 0.6 MK, have been studied by Pant et al. (2017)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - Ultraviolet coronal emission lines (as used by SoHO/SUMER).
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "detected as rapidly decaying periodic Doppler shifts of coronal emission lines" (context from the discussion on SUMER oscillations).
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Doppler shifts and line-integrated intensity variations which serve as proxies for the plasma dynamics in the coronal loops.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These characteristics form the observational basis for what is now known as SUMER oscillations.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Observations Associated with Different Thermal Conditions
- **Time Range**:
   - For plasma temperatures associated with SUMER oscillations:
     - At 6.3 MK: characteristic heating/cooling times τ₁ ≈ 37 min and τ₂ ≈ 12 min.
     - At 8.9 MK: characteristic heating/cooling times τ₁ ≈ 65 min and τ₂ ≈ 19 min.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "For example, for the temperatures associated with SUMER oscillations, 6.3 MK and 8.9 MK, we obtain τ₁ ≈37 min and τ₂ ≈12 min, and τ₁ ≈65 min and τ₂ ≈19 min, respectively, for a = −0.5 and b = −3."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Although not explicitly re‐stated for this collection period, the instrument continues to record ultraviolet coronal emission lines.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The measured periods and damping rates of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in coronal loops.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These time scales are used in the theoretical model to assess the impact of the misbalance between radiative cooling and heating on the damping rates. Their values are compared with the observed behaviour of SUMER oscillations in the solar corona.
