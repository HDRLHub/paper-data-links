# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission from coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using spectro-polarimetric radio imaging. It highlights the challenges and recent advancements in imaging low flux density GS emissions near the Sun, which have significantly higher flux densities. The study utilizes the high dynamic range imaging capabilities of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to overcome these challenges. The paper discusses the use of polarimetric imaging to break degeneracies in GS models, which is crucial for accurately estimating CME plasma parameters such as magnetic field strength and the distribution of non-thermal electrons. The observations were conducted on May 4, 2014, focusing on a CME event observed by multiple instruments including the MWA and STEREO-B spacecraft.

## Instrumentation Details

### Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MWA is utilized for its high dynamic range imaging capabilities, which are essential for detecting the faint GS emissions from CMEs in the presence of the much brighter solar emissions.
