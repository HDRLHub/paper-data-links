This script constructs queries to the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for the ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and SOHO-LASCO observations based on the specified time ranges. It prints the results of the queries, which can be used to verify the availability of the data. The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out to prevent execution, as per the directive.
