# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates two partial solar eruptions—one confined and one successful—that are the result of vertical splitting in filament-hosting magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) involving internal reconnection. The research examines the impulsive onset of eruptions, delayed reconnection in the confined event, and associated phenomena such as EUV brightenings, hard X-ray sources, and flare ribbons. The study utilizes high-resolution, high-cadence, multi-wavelength imaging and magnetic field data to analyze the eruptions. Main observation and analysis periods are SOL2014-12-24T02:30 and SOL2015-11-04T13:31, with supporting datasets covering precursors and aftermaths of eruptions. Results are based on direct analysis of data from SDO/AIA, SDO/HMI, GONG and other Hα facilities, RHESSI, Fermi, LASCO, and solar radio instruments.
