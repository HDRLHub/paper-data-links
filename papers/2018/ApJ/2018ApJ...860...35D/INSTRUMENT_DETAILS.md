## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a compound solar eruption from NOAA AR 11429 on 2012 March 10. The eruption involved two consecutively destabilized magnetic structures (referred to as hot-channel structures A and B in a double-decker configuration) that produced two peaks during the impulsive phase of an M8.5-class flare. The study employs full-disk, multi-wavelength, and multi-viewpoint observations to track both the evolution of the pre-eruptive configuration and the eruption dynamics. Key data were obtained using instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (both imaging and magnetic field observations), as well as complementary coronagraph and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) instruments on STEREO, and white-light as well as X-ray imagers from SOHO and GOES. The data collection spans from 2012 March 9, 04:00 UT to March 10, 19:00 UT for SDO observations, with additional targeted observations of the eruption and associated coronal mass ejection (CME).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides full-disk images of the Sun with high cadence (12 s) and high spatial resolution (1.2 arcsec). It simultaneously images the solar atmosphere in 10 different passbands, covering a wide temperature range (60,000 K to 20 MK). This instrument is key for tracing the evolution of coronal structures, such as the hot-channel structures observed in the EUV.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides both line-of-sight and full vector magnetic field data, critical to studying the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field and diagnosing the formation of non-potential structures such as flux ropes.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The HMI provides line-of-sight magnetic field observations at a cadence of 45 s and full vector magnetic data at a cadence of 720 s."

   - Magnetic field vectors and line-of-sight magnetic flux evolution that provide insight into the shearing motions, flux cancellation, and magnetic configuration changes pre-eruption.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - HMI data were also instrumental for the NLFFF (nonlinear force-free field) extrapolation used to model the coronal magnetic field structure.

### 3. Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO-A
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI, part of the SECCHI suite, provides EUV imaging from a vantage point different from SDO, allowing for stereoscopic analysis. It helped determine the three-dimensional geometry and vertical separation of the filament structures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "We also used imaging from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al. (2004))..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: 2012 March 10, approximately 16:31:32 – 2012 March 10, 18:08:32
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The sequence starts on 2012 March 10, 16:31:32 and ends on 2012 March 10, 18:08:32." (from Figure 8 caption)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - EUVI observations in 171 Å are mentioned in the figure descriptions.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The upper three panels show the ﬁlaments at diﬀerent time in STEREO-A EUVI 171 ˚A."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - EUV imaging capturing the filament/prominence structures and their spatial disposition (e.g., the vertical separation of ~12 Mm between the two filaments).
- **Additional Comments**:
   - STEREO-A’s view was critical because AR 11429 was behind the limb for STEREO-B, making STEREO-A the only STEREO source to provide a clear perspective on the double-decker configuration.
