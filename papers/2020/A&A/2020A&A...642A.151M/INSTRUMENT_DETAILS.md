## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates moving solar radio bursts observed during two interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on 22 May 2013. The paper combines radio imaging and dynamic spectra with white‐light and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from multiple space‐ and ground‐based instruments. Detailed timing information—from the earliest radio snapshots at around 12:50 UT through composite dynamic spectra showing burst evolution into the later phases of the eruption—is used to link the radio emission (observed at different frequencies) to the evolving CME structure as revealed by coronagraphs and EUV imagers. Three distinct radio sources (labelled Source 1, Source 2, and Source 3) are identified using imaging from the Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) and corroborated with fine-structured features in dynamic spectra from instruments such as ORFEES and NDA. Additional imaging by spacecraft including SDO, PROBA2, SOHO, and STEREO (using instruments such as AIA, SWAP, LASCO, EUVI, and COR1/2) provides a complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the CME evolution and its interaction with a preceding CME, which is central to understanding the acceleration of electron beams responsible for the observed radio bursts.
