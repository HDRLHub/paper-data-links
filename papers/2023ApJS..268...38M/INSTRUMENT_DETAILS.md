## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on connecting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to their source regions, creating a CME source region (CSR) catalogue, and examining the influence of these source regions on various statistical properties of CMEs. The study spans from 1998 to 2017, covering solar cycles 23 and 24, and categorizes 3327 CMEs into three source region types: Active Regions (ARs), Prominence Eruptions (PEs), and Active Prominences (APs). The paper also explores the distribution of CME speeds, latitudinal deflections, and the East-West asymmetry in source region longitudes, highlighting how these factors are influenced by the source regions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EIT is used to identify the source regions of CMEs by capturing images of the solar disk in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of CME source regions
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar disk features associated with CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: EIT data were crucial for the initial identification of source regions in the CSR catalogue.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides high-resolution images of the solar atmosphere in multiple EUV wavelengths, aiding in detailed analysis of CME source regions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed imaging of CME source regions
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple EUV channels
- **Physical Observable**: Solar atmospheric features linked to CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: AIA data were used alongside EIT to enhance the accuracy of source region identification.

### COR-1, COR-2, and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments provide complementary data from different viewpoints, helping to track CMEs and their source regions across a broader spatial context.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Multi-viewpoint observation of CMEs and their source regions
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV and white light (COR-1 and COR-2)
- **Physical Observable**: CME propagation and source region dynamics
- **Additional Comments**: The combination of COR-1, COR-2, and EUVI was essential for understanding the 3D structure and propagation characteristics of CMEs, especially during the STEREO era starting in 2006.

### Additional Instruments and Data Sources
- **General Comments**:
   - The study also utilized data from the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) CME catalogue, which includes observations primarily from the LASCO coronagraph on SOHO. This catalogue provided the foundational data for selecting CME events and linking them to source regions identified using the instruments listed above.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Compilation of CME data for catalogue creation
- **Time Range**: 1998 – 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily visible light (coronagraphic)
- **Physical Observable**: CMEs in the coronagraph field of view
- **Additional Comments**: The CDAW catalogue was instrumental in providing a comprehensive list of CMEs, which were then analyzed in conjunction with EUV and multi-viewpoint data to create the CSR catalogue.
