## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the observations of the solar corona beyond 2 R⊙ using the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. The primary focus is on the Full Sun Imager (FSI) channel, which provides wide field-of-view EUV diagnostics of the solar atmosphere. The FSI operates in two narrowbands centered on 17.4 nm and 30.4 nm, capturing the morphology and dynamics of the solar atmosphere. The paper details the use of an occulting disk to minimize instrumental stray light, enabling the detection of signals up to 7 R⊙. Comparisons with other instruments like LASCO and Metis are made to highlight morphological similarities and differences in the observed emissions.
