produce the script. We need to focus on querying data from the ACE and Wind spacecraft instruments as mentioned in the context. The key instruments are EPAM, MAG, SWEPAM on ACE, and SST on Wind. We will construct queries for each instrument based on the specific time ranges and physical observables detailed in the context. Since the exact time of the shock crossing is not provided, we will use the general time range of 24 hours before the shock as mentioned. The physical observables include particle fluxes, magnetic field components, and solar wind conditions. We will ensure the script is clear, well-commented, and adheres strictly to the provided details.
