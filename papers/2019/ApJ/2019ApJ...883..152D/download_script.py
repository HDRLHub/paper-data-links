This script uses SunPy's VSO client to search for LASCO coronagraph data from SOHO.
In the context of the paper, data from LASCO C2 and C3 on April 30, 2011 are required.
The paper uses LASCO C2 for a face‚Äêon total brightness observation at 16:23:04 UT,
and LASCO C3 for a similar total brightness observation at 16:17:04 UT.
Since the VSO interface only lists SOHO/LASCO detectors (C1, C2, C3),
we restrict our queries to LASCO C2 and LASCO C3, with the time ranges as specified.
Note: The actual downloading step is commented out.

# Note: In the scientific paper, polarized brightness (pB) sequences were also used
# for LASCO C2. However, as the VSO interface does not differentiate pB observations
# for LASCO data, and the primary search parameters are time and instrument, we have 
# restricted the queries to the total brightness datasets.
# 
# If pB data were available in the interface, an additional query for pB images
# (e.g., by specifying a different a.Physobs or a custom attribute) would follow the same pattern.

# files_c2 = Fido.fetch(query_c2)
