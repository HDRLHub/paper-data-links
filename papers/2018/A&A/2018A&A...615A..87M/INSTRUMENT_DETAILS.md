## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the relationship between solar magnetic structures, particularly in quiet Sun regions, and the chromospheric emission characterized by the S-index. The research objectives include deriving empirical relations for reconstructing the solar S-index from surface magnetic features across activity levels, vital for modeling and comparing solar and stellar activity impacts on radial velocity measurements and exoplanet detectability. The primary data sources integrated for analysis are full-disk magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the SOHO spacecraft (covering 21 April 1996 to 31 December 2010), alongside chromospheric Ca II emission time series from the Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak Observatories. The study aligns these datasets over specific, overlapping daily intervals (notably a 1584-day period), calibrates them to a unified S-index, and reconstructs the chromospheric emission as a function of observed solar magnetic conditions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The MDI instrument provided full-disk photospheric magnetograms essential to quantify solar magnetic flux, filling factors of active structures, and temporal evolution over the solar cycle, forming the basis for magnetic-proxy–to–S-index relationships analyzed in this paper.
- **Supporting Quote**: "we used full-disk magnetograms provided the Michelson Doppler imaging (MDI) on board the SOHO spacecraft (Scherrer et al. 1995). In this paper we consider the 5 min averaged magnetograms and select one image per day when available, i.e., 4181 images obtained between 21 April 1996 and 30 December 2010."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Daily full-disk magnetograms for magnetic structure analysis
- **Time Range**: 1996-04-21 – 2010-12-30
  - **Supporting Quote**: "4181 images obtained between 21 April 1996 and 30 December 2010."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Photospheric magnetic field (Ni I 6768 Å line)
  - **Supporting Quote**: No explicit wavelength stated in the provided text, but MDI operates at "Ni I 6768 Å" as per instrument design (not claimed by user).
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field strength (line-of-sight), used to derive filling factors, average field strength, and distribution of quiet/active regions.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We extracted averages from the absolute value of the magnetic field for various pixel selections in the following section."
- **Additional Comments**: The analysis included magnetogram noise correction and separation of quiet Sun, network, and plage regions.

#### Data Collection Period 2: 1-minute cadence magnetograms for robustness/tests
- **Time Range**: 1996-04-21 – 2010-12-31
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We also performed the same analysis on 1 min magnetograms (4755 images between 21 April 1996 and 31 December 2010) to check for the robustness of the results. This gives similar results, although they are naturally shifted toward slightly larger averaged magnetic fields (because of the larger noise level)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: (See above—Ni I 6768 Å; not repeated in text for this subset.)
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field, tested for robustness of feature detection and noise effects.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We also performed the same analysis on 1 min magnetograms (4755 images between 21 April 1996 and 31 December 2010) to check for the robustness of the results."
- **Additional Comments**: Used to assess time-averaging impact on noise and magnetic field measurements.

### Synoptic Ca II HK Index Measurements at Sacramento Peak Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - The Sacramento Peak Observatory Ca II index formed the main chromospheric emission timeseries, providing daily records suitable for detailed correlation and calibration with magnetic diagnostics, and forming the core of the solar S-index reconstruction in this study.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this section, we use the Ca-index that is obtained almost daily at the Sacramento Peak Observatory because significantly more points are available compared to the Kitt Peak observations."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Chromospheric Ca II emission index measurements, daily
- **Time Range**: 1996–2010 (specific overlap with MDI: 1584 days within this period)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "This joint analysis of the 5 min magnetograms and Sacramento Peak indexes can be performed for 1584 days. We focused on this time series in the following subsection."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ca II K line (3933.7 Å) chromospheric emission (specific line in standard solar S-index practice, but not explicitly stated here)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In this section, we use the Ca-index that is obtained almost daily at the Sacramento Peak Observatory"
- **Physical Observable**: Line-core intensity ratio (Ca II index), empirically calibrated into the Mount Wilson S-index, representative of chromospheric emission and correlated with magnetic activity.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We first calibrated the Sacramento Peak index into a Kitt Peak Ca index as carried out by White et al. (1998) and obtained the following law based on 481 common observing days... We could then use the conversion from the Kitt Peak Ca-index to the Mount Wilson S-index derived by Radick et al. (1998)... In this section we use data obtained between 1996 and 2010, which covers the temporal range for which we are able to estimate full-disk magnetic fluxes. Both equations 1 and 2 are used to convert the Sacramento Peak Ca-index into S."
- **Additional Comments**: Frequent sampling enabled comprehensive joint magnetic-emission analysis.

### Synoptic Ca II HK Index Measurements at Kitt Peak Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided an independent chromospheric emission dataset contemporaneous with MDI time series and Sacramento Peak observations, used for cross-calibration and validation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We analyzed a long time series of Michelson Doppler imaging (MDI) magnetograms jointly with chromospheric emission time series obtained at Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Chromospheric Ca II emission index measurements
- **Time Range**: 1996–2010 (precise days contemporaneous with MDI and Sacramento Peak datasets for comparison/minima analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We add the Kitt Peak Ca index whenever available, also converted into a Mount Wilson S-index. The time series are smoothed at different timescales using a running mean: 28 days, 3 months, and 1 year."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Ca II K line (3933.7 Å) chromospheric emission
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We add the Kitt Peak Ca index whenever available, also converted into a Mount Wilson S-index."
- **Physical Observable**: Ca II K index, empirically mapped to the Mount Wilson S-index to enable direct comparison with magnetic proxies and Sacramento Peak results.
  - **Supporting Quote**: (see above)
- **Additional Comments**: Used for robust assessment of solar minima chromospheric emission levels and to cross-check the calibration of the Sacramento Peak time series.
