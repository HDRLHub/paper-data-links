1. Wind 3DP low‐energy electrostatic analyzer (on board the Wind spacecraft)
   - Observational Role: Provided the high‐quality measurements of electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) used for multiparameter fits, which are central to quantifying the electron heat flux.
   - Time Range: Data were acquired between 1995 and 2000.
   - Details: 
     • The instrument measured electron distributions at 1 AU.
     • Its data set (15,314 measurements overall, with a high‐quality subset of 2,840) was used for detailed multi‐parameter fits with bi-Maxwellian, bi-kappa, and bi-self-similar fitting functions.
     • These fits enabled subsequent computation of third-order (heat flux partition fractions α∥ and α⊥) and fourth-order moment parameters (η∥ and η⊥) relevant for the theoretical modeling of electron heat flux in the solar wind.
   - Supporting Quote: “Wilson et al. (2019a) performed multi-parameter ﬁts to a set of 15,314 electron VDF measurements made at 1 AU, between 1995 and 2000, with the Wind spacecraft’s 3DP low-energy electrostatic analyzer.”

2. Ulysses SWOOPS (Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun) instrument (on board the Ulysses spacecraft)
   - Observational Role: Provided examples of multi-component VDF fits—used to benchmark and compare heat flux values derived from fluid moment models.
   - Time Range: Data used in the study were from days 288 and 365 of the year 2002.
   - Details:
     • This instrument produced fits that used drifting bi-Maxwellians and generalized anisotropic κ distributions.
     • The VDFs from SWOOPS helped illustrate cases with large normalized heat flux values (e.g., models showing qr/q0 of 0.2003 and 0.3201), and were compared with the analytic treatments.
   - Supporting Quote: “Scherer et al. (2021) provided two examples of multicomponent VDF ﬁts made with data from the Ulysses SWOOPS (Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun) instrument, from days 288 and 365 of the year 2002.”
