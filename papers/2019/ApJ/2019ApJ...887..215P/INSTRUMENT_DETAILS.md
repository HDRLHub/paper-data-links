## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a nonlinear mean‐field dynamo model of the solar interior that reproduces the observed cyclic variations in the global magnetic field, differential rotation, and meridional circulation of the Sun. Central to the study is the explanation of the extended 22‐year pattern of solar torsional oscillations—variations in the angular velocity that propagate from high latitudes toward the equator. Model predictions are compared with observational data to validate features such as the overlap of subsequent magnetic cycles in time–latitude diagrams and the associated zonal flow accelerations. The observations, which include detailed time–latitude diagrams of the radial magnetic field and zonal velocities, are instrumental in confirming the model’s capability to recreate the extended solar cycle dynamics observed over the past two solar cycles (approximately from 2000 to 2015).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SoHO/MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument was used to obtain full-disk Doppler and magnetic field measurements which capture the evolution of the solar surface phenomena such as the radial magnetic field and the torsional oscillations (zonal velocity patterns). Its data are crucial for constructing time–latitude diagrams that reveal the long-term (extended) solar cycle dynamics.

- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The SoHO/MDI data are used in conjunction with those from SDO/HMI to validate the extended cyclic evolution predicted by the model.

### 2. SDO/HMI on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI provides high-resolution Doppler and magnetogram data. It complements the observations from SoHO/MDI by furnishing additional detailed measurements of the solar radial magnetic field and the torsional (zonal) oscillation patterns, which are critical for the analysis of the extended 22-year cycle.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of Solar Magnetic and Velocity Fields
- **Time Range**: Approximately 2000 – 2015  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - The figures display time markers “2000, 2005, 2010, 2015,” indicating that the observational dataset (including HMI data) covers these years.
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
   - Not specified in the provided context.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - There is no mention of specific wavelength information for HMI in the text.
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Observables include measurements of the solar radial magnetic field and the associated zonal oscillation velocity (torsional oscillations).

- **Additional Comments**:  
   - Although the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) began its observing mission in 2010, the combined observational analysis in the paper presents a merged dataset from SoHO/MDI and SDO/HMI, covering a prolonged period (roughly 2000–2015) that is essential for examining the extended solar cycle phenomena.
