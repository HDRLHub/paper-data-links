## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study investigates plasma characteristics in six coronal dimming events associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The research employs Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis using high-cadence imaging data, specifically from the six EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The time ranges for direct data analysis span 12-hour intervals per event, covering a broad spectrum of CME and flare classes and their evolution. Observational data are used to derive emission measure, electron density, and temperature maps, leading to the main findings: rapid and strong density decreases in core dimming regions, more gradual changes in secondary dimmings, and the temporal behaviour of these features. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) LOS magnetograms (also on SDO) are used to add context in identifying the magnetic environment of dimming regions, but only AIA EUV data are used for direct plasma diagnostics and DEM inversion. Data collection periods, wavelengths, and regions of observation are tied closely to the start and recovery phases of the associated solar flares for each event.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field context in relation to the location of dimming regions. NOT used for coronal plasma parameter reconstructions, only context for interpreting locations/magnetic polarity.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We also compared the detected dimming region with photospheric magnetic ﬁeld maps as shown in Figure 2. These are LOS magnetic ﬁeld data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) onboard SDO."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Contextual magnetic field mapping for all six events
- **Time Range**: Matched to near-start times of each EUV event (e.g., 2011-09-06T22:22 UT, 2011-09-06T22:52 UT, etc., for different events)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "SDO/HMI LOS magnetic ﬁeld data (scaled to ±100 G) for the event on 06 September 2011 at a timestep close to the start of the ﬂare."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric LOS magnetic field, used to locate core versus secondary dimming region magnetic polarities.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "These are LOS magnetic ﬁeld data ... The core dimming regions (left panel) are localized, and do not show much expansion through the progress of the event. They occur in pairs of opposite polarity within the active region where the magnetic ﬁeld density is high."
- **Additional Comments**: Not used for actual DEM or plasma parameter inversion; solely for contextual region identification.
