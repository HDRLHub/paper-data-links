## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the frequency stability of solar oscillations above the acoustic cut-off frequency, known as pseudomodes, and their variation with solar activity. The study utilizes data from three instruments: Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO), Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies (GOLF), and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). The data spans over two solar cycles (1996–2021), and the analysis focuses on two frequency ranges: 5600–6800 µHz and 5600–7800 µHz. The study finds that pseudomode frequency variations are in anti-phase with the solar cycle for GONG data, while no significant variation is observed for VIRGO and GOLF data.

## Instrumentation Details

### VIRGO on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - VIRGO comprises three Sun photometers (SPMs) measuring solar spectral irradiance at three wavelengths: 402 nm (blue), 500 nm (green), and 862 nm (red). The data is used to study the temporal variation of pseudomode frequencies through the solar cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The VIRGO instrument, on SoHO, comprises three Sun photometers (SPMs) for measuring the solar spectral irradiance at three independent wavelengths: 402 nm (blue), 500 nm (green), and 862 nm (red)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period
- **Time Range**: 1 April 1996 – 30 March 2014
   - **Supporting Quote**: "This study uses the freely available data, which extend from 1 April 1996 to 30 March 2014 and have a temporal cadence of 60 s."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 402 nm, 500 nm, 862 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The VIRGO instrument, on SoHO, comprises three Sun photometers (SPMs) for measuring the solar spectral irradiance at three independent wavelengths: 402 nm (blue), 500 nm (green), and 862 nm (red)."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "The VIRGO instrument, on SoHO, comprises three Sun photometers (SPMs) for measuring the solar spectral irradiance at three independent wavelengths: 402 nm (blue), 500 nm (green), and 862 nm (red)."
- **Additional Comments**: The data was split into 100-day segments with a 50-day overlap for analysis.

### GOLF on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - GOLF is a resonant scatter spectrophotometer measuring line-of-sight velocities using the sodium doublet. The data is used to study the temporal variation of pseudomode frequencies through the solar cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**: "GOLF is a resonant scatter spectrophotometer, which is also aboard SoHO. It measured line-of-sight velocities using the sodium doublet."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period
- **Time Range**: 11 April 1996 – 10 April 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "GOLF started observing in January 1996, but due to malfunctions, continuous observations began not until April 1996... GOLF observations have a cadence of 20 s. Data are processed in the manner described in García et al. (2005) and recently have been recalibrated by Appourchaux et al. (2018)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Sodium doublet
   - **Supporting Quote**: "It measured line-of-sight velocities using the sodium doublet."
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight velocities
   - **Supporting Quote**: "It measured line-of-sight velocities using the sodium doublet."
- **Additional Comments**: The data was split into 100-day segments with a 50-day overlap for analysis. The instrument's mode of operation and voltage applied to detectors were changed several times.

### GONG Network
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG is a network of six sites around Earth that constantly observe the Sun with velocity imagers. The data is used to study the temporal variation of pseudomode frequencies through the solar cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) is a network of six sites around Earth that aims to constantly observe the Sun with velocity imagers."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period
- **Time Range**: 16 June 2001 – 15 May 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We use the gap-filled network-merged 36-day GONG month time series (mrvmt) from the online GONG archive... covering 16 June 2001 to 15 May 2021."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar oscillations
   - **Supporting Quote**: "GONG data can be used to study the oscillations above the acoustic cut-off frequency."
- **Additional Comments**: The data was split into 100-day segments with a 50-day overlap for analysis. The response function peaks at a height of about 200 km above the solar surface.
