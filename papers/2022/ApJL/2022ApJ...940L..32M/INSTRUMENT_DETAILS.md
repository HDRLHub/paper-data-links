## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the observation of the nascent dynamic solar wind structure at 2.6 solar radii using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio telescopes. The study aims to understand the oscillation and propagation of the solar wind by analyzing frequency fluctuations (FF) of spacecraft signals from China's Tianwen-1 (TIW) and ESA's Mars Express (MEX). The observations were conducted on October 9, 2021, during a coronal mass ejection (CME) event. The data were collected from multiple radio telescopes, and the study employs cross-correlation analysis to estimate solar wind velocity variations along radial and tangential directions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used to monitor large-scale solar wind from 1.5 to 32 solar radii. It provides crucial data for studying the solar corona and the dynamics of CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In order to monitor the large scale solar wind from 1.5 to 32 Rs, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the on board Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instruments were launched in 1995 to the Lagrange L1 to study the solar corona (Brueckner et al. 1995; Doming et al. 1995)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Observation
- **Time Range**: October 9, 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CME was a halo in SOHO LASCO C2 and C3. The associated eruption followed the M1.6 class flare from AR 2882 and was characterized by significant dimming, an EUV wave and post-eruptive arcades seen mostly to the West from AR 2882 in SDO AIA 193, 304, 171 and in EUVI A 195 starting at 2021-10-09T06:33Z."
