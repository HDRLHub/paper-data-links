1. Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
   - **General Comments**:  
     The MWA is described in the paper as “a low‐frequency radio interferometer in Western Australia with an instantaneous bandwidth of 30.72 MHz that can be flexibly distributed from 80 to 300 MHz.” It is the primary instrument used to image type III solar radio bursts. Its data allow the authors to extract dynamic spectra, source positions, and flux densities.

   - **Data Collection Periods**:
     - **Data Collection Period 1 (2014-10-14 event)**:
       - **Time Range**: The dynamic spectra and imaging indicate a start time of “2014/10/14 03:03:30 UT” with burst features clearly evolving around 03:05–03:06 UT.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         “Start time = 2014/10/14 03:03:30 … (see Figure 2 showing the dynamic spectra for the 2014-10-14 event)”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Observations are made in multiple frequency channels covering approximately 80, 89, 98, 108, 120, 132, 145, 161, 179, 196, 217, and 240 MHz.  
       - **Physical Observable**: Radio flux density and spatially resolved source positions of type III bursts.
       - **Additional Comments**: High time resolution (0.5 s cadence) and detailed imaging allow determination of electron beam speeds and density profiles.
     - **Data Collection Period 2 (2015-09-23 event)**:
       - **Time Range**: The paper notes “Start time = 2015/09/23 03:07:45 UT” with dynamic spectral segments extending to around 03:12 UT.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         “Start time = 2015/09/23 03:07:45 … (Figure 3 shows the dynamic spectra for the 2015-09-23 event)”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Same frequency channels as above (80–240 MHz).  
       - **Physical Observable**: Imaging of coherent radio burst emission to derive density gradients and electron beam speeds.
     - **Data Collection Period 3 (2015-10-27 event)**:
       - **Time Range**: For the 2015-10-27 event, the observations begin at “2015/10/27 02:54:09 UT” with subsequent burst features noted around “02:55:30 UT” up to about “02:55:50 UT.”  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         “Start time = 2015/10/27 02:54:09 … and Start time = 2015/10/27 02:55:30 … (see Figure 3)”  
       - **Wavelength(s)**: Again the instrument covers channels from 80 to 240 MHz.  
       - **Physical Observable**: Imaging the spatial progression of type III burst contours to extract height and density information.

2. SOHO LASCO C2 Coronagraph
   - **General Comments**:  
     The LASCO C2 coronagraph, onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), provides white light images of the corona. It is used in the paper to supply context by revealing the large‐scale coronal structures (streamers) associated with the radio bursts.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “The white light images were produced by the Large Angle and Spectrometric C2 Coronagraph (LASCO C2; Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)…”
   - **Time Range**:  
     Although no precise UT range is given for LASCO C2 images, it is noted that:
     - LASCO C2 has an observing cadence of 20 minutes.
     - For instance, in one overlay (Figure 4) the nearest image in time to the radio burst for the 2015-09-23 event is marked as “03:12:09 UT.”
     - For the 2015-10-27 event, the paper mentions that a coronal mass ejection (CME) “passed the C2 occulting disk around 20-min prior to the type III burst.”
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors**:  
     As a coronagraph, LASCO C2 observes visible white light scattered by coronal electrons.
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     The instrument maps the brightness of the corona (white light emission) to reveal structures such as streamers and the leading edge of CMEs.

3. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) – Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
   - **General Comments**:  
     The AIA on SDO is an EUV imager used to capture the fine-scale coronal structure. In this paper, the AIA 171 Å channel is utilized because it clearly delineates the magnetic structures along which the type III beams are expected to travel.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “The EUV data come from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We use the 171 Å AIA channel, which is dominated by Fe IX emission produced by plasma at around 0.63 MK…”
   - **Time Range**:  
     AIA images are taken at a high cadence (12 s), but for the purposes of this paper they are averaged over 10 minutes (50 images) to cover the periods during and immediately after the radio bursts.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors**:  
     – Wavelength: 171 Å (EUV).  
     – Detector: EUV imager sensitive to Fe IX emission.
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     Observes the distribution and evolution of the coronal plasma and magnetic structures.

4. STEREO-A – Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI)
   - **General Comments**:  
     The EUVI onboard the STEREO-A spacecraft provides additional context for coronal activity. It is specifically mentioned in the paper in connection with the 2015-10-27 event, where EUVI images helped establish that the CME originated from an active region occulted from the AIA perspective.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “Inspection of images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Howard et al., 2008) onboard the STEREO-A spacecraft shows that the CME originated from a large active region close to the east limb…”
   - **Time Range**:  
     No precise time stamps are provided for the EUVI data in the text; however, its use is linked to the 2015-10-27 event, providing context around the time of that type III burst.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors**:  
     Observes in the extreme ultraviolet; specific channels are not detailed in the provided context.
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     Captures EUV emissions that reveal the source and evolution of the CME associated with the radio burst.

5. Learmonth and Culgoora Solar Radio Spectrographs
   - **General Comments**:  
     These ground‐based solar radio spectrographs are used (via NOAA event reports) to identify and verify burst periods during the MWA observing runs. They complement the MWA observations by providing continuous spectral coverage at frequencies that overlap with the low- and high-frequency ends of the MWA’s range.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “Burst periods during MWA observing runs were identified using the daily National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) solar event reports based on observations from the Learmonth (Guidice et al., 1981; Kennewell and Steward, 2003) and Culgoora (Prestage et al., 1994) solar radio spectrographs…”
   - **Time Range**:  
     Specific time stamps for these spectrograph observations are not provided; they are referenced in a statistical sense over the observing periods in 2014 and 2015 to corroborate the MWA-selected events.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors**:  
     They cover parts of the solar radio spectrum that complement the MWA frequency range.
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     Used to monitor type III radio burst activity and help select isolated events with coherent frequency drifts.
