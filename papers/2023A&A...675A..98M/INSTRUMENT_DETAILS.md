## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates a type II solar radio burst that occurred without an associated coronal mass ejection (CME). Using a combination of radio imaging from the Nançay Radioheliograph and observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the study explores the origins of this type II burst. The burst is linked to a C-class solar flare and is characterized by its location above the flaring region and ahead of disturbed coronal loops observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images. The absence of a visible CME suggests that the shock wave responsible for the type II burst may have been generated by the flare itself or by bulk plasma motions related to a failed eruption. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the event, including the dynamics of the EUV front, the radio emission characteristics, and the coronal conditions during the burst.

## Instrumentation Details

### Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Nançay Radioheliograph was crucial for imaging the radio emission from the type II burst at specific frequencies, providing insights into the spatial characteristics and movement of the radio sources associated with the burst.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Imaging of type II burst
- **Time Range**: Specific time not provided in the context
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The harmonic lane of the type II burst is observed in images from the Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) at 150 and 173 MHz with a cadence of 0.25 s."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Radio wavelengths corresponding to 150 and 173 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Both split bands of the harmonic lane can be imaged at these two frequencies."
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emission from type II solar radio burst
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The elliptical Gaussian was fitted to radio contours with values over 107 K in brightness temperature which includes most of the extent of the radio sources observed."
- **Additional Comments**: The NRH provided detailed imaging that helped in analyzing the movement and spatial distribution of the radio burst sources.

### Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SDO was used to observe the associated flare and the disturbed coronal loops in EUV images, which were crucial for understanding the context and environment of the type II burst.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of flare and coronal loops
- **Time Range**: Specific time not provided in the context
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The flare and the associated active region can also be observed in EUV images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The type II radio sources are located on the western solar limb (for a full evolution of the radio bursts and the flare, see Movies 1 and 2 accompanying this paper)."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV images of the flare and disturbed coronal loops
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In the AIA 211 Å channel, also in running difference images, a faint EUV front or wave is observed propagating towards the limb."
- **Additional Comments**: SDO's observations were integral in linking the radio observations with solar surface phenomena.

### Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO provided additional viewpoints for observing the flare and potential associated phenomena, such as disturbed loops and faint features beyond the solar limb.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of disturbed loops and faint features
- **Time Range**: Specific time not provided in the context
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At 13:35 UT, a set of disturbed loops are visible outside the solar limb in EUVI 195 Å images."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light and EUV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "After this time, COR1A shows a faint feature first appearing in its field-of-view at 13:50 UT that does not propagate further into the outer corona beyond ∼2.3 R⊙."
- **Physical Observable**: Disturbed loops and faint moving features beyond the solar limb
   - **Supporting Quote**: "This feature eventually disappears from the running difference images at 14:25 UT."
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO's observations complemented those from SDO and NRH, providing a more comprehensive view of the event from different perspectives.
