## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents an integrated catalog of solar energetic particle (SEP) events spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. The catalog is based on data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, specifically focusing on integral proton flux measurements. The study aims to provide a homogenized dataset by correlating and integrating three existing catalogs: PSEP, CDAW-SEP, and NOAA-SEP. The catalog includes metadata on physical parameters and observables related to source solar eruptions, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The dataset is intended to support machine learning and statistical analysis for space weather prediction.

## Instrumentation Details

### Space Environment Monitor (SEM) on board GOES
- **General Comments**:
   - The SEM is a key instrument on the GOES satellites, used to monitor the near-Earth space environment. It includes detectors for measuring solar activity and in-situ radiation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The GOES series carries various instruments, including the Space Environment Monitor (SEM, Grubb 1975)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General monitoring of solar activity and in-situ radiation
- **Time Range**: 1986 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The database comprises of 341 SEP events, extending from 1986 to 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar activity and in-situ radiation environment
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The GOES satellites record the solar activity and the in-situ radiation environment."
- **Additional Comments**: The SEM includes various detectors, such as the Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS) and the Energetic Proton, Electron, and Alpha Detector (EPEAD).

### Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS) on board GOES-5 to GOES-12
- **General Comments**:
   - The EPS is a constituent detector of the SEM, used for measuring energetic particles in several energy bands.
- **Supporting Quote**: "One of its constituent detectors is called the Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS, Onsager et al. 1996) on GOES-5 to 12."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement of energetic particles
- **Time Range**: 1986 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We utilize the integral proton fluxes measured on board GOES 05–15 that are archived on the NOAA website."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Proton channels with characteristic energies from a few to several hundred MeVs
   - **Supporting Quote**: "There are seven proton channels in the EPS/EPEAD taking in-situ differential measurements with characteristic energies spanning from a few up to several hundreds of megaelectron volts (MeVs)."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton fluxes
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The time intensities of particle fluxes are used to define and characterize SEP events."
- **Additional Comments**: The EPS data were cross-calibrated with other instruments to ensure accuracy.

### Energetic Proton, Electron, and Alpha Detector (EPEAD) on board GOES-13 to GOES-15
- **General Comments**:
   - The EPEAD is an advanced version of the EPS, used for measuring energetic protons, electrons, and alpha particles.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The twin EPS system on GOES-13 to 15 is called the Energetic Proton, Electron, and Alpha Detector (EPEAD)."

- **Additional Comments**: The EPEAD data were inspected for differences in enhancements between the “East” and “West” channels.

### GOES Primary and Secondary Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES satellites operate in pairs, with one designated as the primary and the other as the secondary. Both satellites make parallel measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**: "NOAA classifies the two GOES satellites making parallel measurements as the 'primary' and the 'secondary' one."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Parallel measurements of solar activity and in-situ radiation
- **Time Range**: 1986 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Over the three SCs from 1986 to 2017, eleven different GOES satellites have been launched and commissioned."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar activity and in-situ radiation environment
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The GOES satellites record the solar activity and the in-situ radiation environment."
- **Additional Comments**: The primary and secondary instruments were cross-verified to ensure data accuracy.

### GOES Proton Channels (P1 to P7)
- **General Comments**:
   - The proton channels on GOES satellites measure integral proton fluxes in different energy bands.
- **Supporting Quote**: "These channels are binned to seven nominal integral energies: P1 (>1 MeV), P2 (>5 MeV), P3 (>10 MeV), P4 (>30 MeV), P5 (>50 MeV), P6 (>60 MeV), and P7 (>100 MeV)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement of proton fluxes
