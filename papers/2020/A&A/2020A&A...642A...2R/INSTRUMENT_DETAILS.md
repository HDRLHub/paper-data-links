1. PHI (Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager) on board Solar Orbiter  
   - General Comments:  
     - PHI is one of the primary remote‐sensing instruments onboard Solar Orbiter. In its high‐resolution configuration (PHI/HRT), it is designed to obtain photospheric vector magnetograms. Its unique off‐ecliptic viewing angle (when Solar Orbiter is located 180° from the Sun–Earth line) also helps resolve the 180° ambiguity inherent in single–vantage–point observations.  
     - Supporting Quote: “For the first time, the Solar Orbiter’s PHI instrument (Solanki et al. 2020) will provide surface magnetic ﬁeld measurements from outside the Sun–Earth line and from outside the ecliptic plane.”  
   - Data Collection Period (RS Mode):  
     - Time Range: Operates during Solar Orbiter remote sensing windows – typically three 10–day windows per orbit.  
       - Supporting Quote: “RS instruments … observing during three 10–day windows per orbit…”
     - Additional Comment: As a remote‐sensing instrument, PHI contributes to targeting via Very Short Term Planning (VSTP); its measurements will be compared with Earth–based HMI magnetograms to resolve ambiguities.
