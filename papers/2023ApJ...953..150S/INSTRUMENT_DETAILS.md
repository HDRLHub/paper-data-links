## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of the 'Cartwheel' coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on April 9, 2008. The research involves reconstructing the 3D path of the CME and modeling its behavior using magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. The study highlights the CME's interaction with a coronal hole and a pseudostreamer, which influenced its trajectory through magnetic forces. The paper utilizes data from multiple spacecraft and applies various reconstruction techniques to analyze the CME's deflection and the forces acting upon it. The findings contribute to understanding the complex dynamics of CMEs and their interactions with surrounding magnetic structures.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The EIT was used to observe the source region of the CME in the EUV spectrum, providing crucial data for the initial 3D trajectory reconstruction of the CME.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the source region and initial CME trajectory
- **Time Range**: Data used from before April 9, 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We use Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI, Scherrer et al. 1995) data for the days before 2008 April 09 and apply the PFSS model to reconstruct the magnetic field over the solar surface."
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUV 195 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At that time, the STEREO spacecraft were separated by ∼ 24◦ from Earth. We use the data provided by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT, Delaboudinière et al. 1995), the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (SOHO/LASCO, Brueckner et al. 1995), the wavelet-enhanced images from Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (STEREO/EUVI, Howard et al. 2008), and COR1 coronagraphs from STEREO spacecraft to reconstruct the trajectory of the prominence and CME."
- **Physical Observable**: Initial position and trajectory of the CME
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Since the source region was located near the western limb of STEREO-A (STA), we reconstruct the initial 3D trajectory from SOHO/EIT 195 and STA/EUVI 195 Å channels."
- **Additional Comments**: The observations were crucial for establishing the conditions before the eruption and for the initial phase of the trajectory reconstruction.

### Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI was instrumental in providing high-resolution images of the CME from multiple viewpoints, which were essential for the 3D reconstruction of the CME's trajectory.

#### Data Collection Period 1: High-resolution imaging of the CME
- **Time Range**: April 9, 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The 2008 April 09 event was observed on the west limb by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and STEREO spacecraft."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å, 195 Å, and 304 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "When the prominence appears in the STEREO-B field-of-view (FOV), we track the ejected material in the 171, 195 and 304 Å channels, from both STEREO spacecraft to ensure we are following the same features and cover the broader time range with high cadence."
- **Physical Observable**: CME trajectory and prominence features
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For the 171 and 195 Å filters we follow the apex of the cold material prominence. In the 304 Å filter and COR1 images, we track the main axis of the prominence, measuring multiple positions each time."
- **Additional Comments**: The detailed tracking across different wavelengths allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the CME's evolution in the low corona.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO was used to observe the CME as it moved further away from the Sun, providing vital data for understanding the CME's evolution in the outer corona.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of CME in the outer corona
- **Time Range**: April 9, 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The 2008 April 09 event was observed on the west limb by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and STEREO spacecraft."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Finally, we track the prominence in white-light images from STEREO/COR1 while it is bright and compact."
- **Physical Observable**: CME structure and trajectory in the outer corona
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In addition, we reconstruct the CME from the EUV 195 Å and white-light images from the three viewpoints (SOHO, STA, and STB)."
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO's observations were crucial for tracking the CME beyond the field of view of the EUVI instruments, providing a complete picture of the CME's trajectory.

These instruments, along with the detailed methodologies employed for data collection and analysis, were critical in reconstructing the trajectory of the 'Cartwheel CME' and understanding the magnetic interactions that influenced its path.
