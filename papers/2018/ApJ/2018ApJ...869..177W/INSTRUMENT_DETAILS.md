## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates sympathetic solar eruptions involving an X1.8-class flare, a failed filament eruption, and a successful filament eruption. The study utilizes multi-wavelength extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and coronagraph observations to track flare evolution, loop dynamics, coronal dimming, and magnetic reconnection signatures. Observations are centered on December 20, 2014, with key time markers such as the flare start at 00:11 UT and peak at 00:28 UT, followed by later dynamical phenomena (e.g., loop expansions and contractions from about 00:37 UT to 01:00 UT). The paper also employs magnetic field reconstructions using PFSS models and HMI data to understand the overlying corona and infer the magnetic configurations that lead to the sympathetic behavior.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA provides high resolution (1.5″) and high cadence (12 s) full-disk images up to 1.28 R⊙ in multiple passbands. Its wide temperature coverage allows observations of hot active-region plasma as well as cooler emission from the quiet corona and chromosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "In this study we mainly used EUV images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2011) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). AIA provides high resolution (1.5′′) and high cadence (12 s) full-disk images up to 1.28 R⊙ at multiple passbands."

#### Data Collection Period 1: X1.8-class Flare Imaging
- **Time Range**: 2014 December 20, 00:11 UT – 00:28 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "The X1.8-class ﬂare starts at 00:11 UT and peaks at 00:28 UT on 2014 December 20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified directly for flare imaging, though AIA’s EUV channels (e.g., 131 Å) are later used to image related dynamic phenomena.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "Among them, 131, 94, and 335˚A are usually sensitive to hot plasma in active regions..."
- **Physical Observable**: Flare emission and associated rapid brightness changes on the solar disk.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - [Context indicates the use of EUV images to track flare-associated structures and dynamics.]

#### Data Collection Period 2: Hot Loop Expansion and Reconnection Signatures (131˚A Channel)
- **Time Range**: Beginning at approximately 00:37 UT and tracked through observations at 00:40 UT, 00:44 UT, and 00:49 UT (up to the time of F3’s eruption)
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "In tandem to the extension of the serpentine ribbon toward F3, a loop overlying F2 appears at about 00:37 UT in 131˚A, apparently rising and expanding, as demonstrated by the snapshots in Figure 7(a–c) ... at 00:40:20 UT can its southern footpoint be identiﬁed..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "In AIA 131˚A, an expanding bubble-like structure can be seen to erupt southwestward from AR 12242..."
- **Physical Observable**: The rising and expanding hot loop, indicating plasma heated to about ∼10 MK.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "This loop is diﬀuse and only visible in 131˚A, suggesting that it is heated to as hot as ∼10 MK."
- **Additional Comments**: The hot loop’s evolution is linked with the process of slipping-like magnetic reconnection, and its appearance provides evidence of energy release and restructuring of overlying magnetic flux.

#### Data Collection Period 3: Cold Loop Contraction and Coronal Dimming (171˚A, 193˚A, 211˚A)
- **Time Range**: Observations captured at approximately 00:51 UT, 00:57 UT, and 01:00 UT during F3’s eruption phase.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "In contrast to the hot loop, a bundle of large-scale cold loops in 171˚A overlying both F2 and F3 are observed to contract toward F3 when F3 begins to erupt... with the white, red and green dotted curves delineating the loop shape at 00:51, 00:57, and 01:00 UT, respectively."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å primarily; complementary dimming is also observed in 193 Å and 211 Å.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "Visible in base-diﬀerence images of all three AIA passbands sensitive to the quiet corona, i.e., 171, 193, and 211˚A, the dimming indicates mass evacuation."
- **Physical Observable**: Contraction of coronal loops (interpreted as a 'coronal implosion') and coronal dimming signaling mass evacuation.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "the cold loop contraction and hot loop expansion during about 00:40–01:00 UT are also associated with coronal dimming..."
- **Additional Comments**: These dynamic features are used to infer the impact of magnetic reconnection on the overlying field and demonstrate energy redistribution during the eruption process.

### 2. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES provides continuous monitoring of the solar soft X-ray flux, which is crucial for determining flare timings and energetics.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "With the soft X-ray 1–8 ˚A ﬂux given by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES; Figure 2a)..."
  
#### Data Collection Period: Flare Monitoring
- **Time Range**: 2014 December 20, 00:11 UT – 00:28 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "The X1.8-class ﬂare starts at 00:11 UT and peaks at 00:28 UT on 2014 December 20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å (soft X-rays)
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "soft X-ray 1–8 ˚A ﬂux given by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite..."
- **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray emission intensity from the solar flare.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - [The text implies the use of GOES soft X-ray flux as a reference for timing and the energy evolution of the X-class flare.]

### 3. Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO provides white-light coronagraph images capable of detecting and tracking coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "Employing the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we identiﬁed both the earlier CME associated with the X-class ﬂare (Figure 1e) and the later one resulting from the successful ﬁlament eruption (Figure 1f, see also Figure 2a)."
  
#### Data Collection Period: CME Observation
- **Time Range**: Observations are associated with events occurring around the flare and filament eruptions on 2014 December 20. The earlier CME is linked to the X-class flare (post 00:28 UT) and a subsequent CME trailing that associated with the successful filament eruption (around the time of F3’s eruption, approximately between 00:40–01:00 UT).
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "the two CMEs occur well within the temporo-spatial range ... the later one resulting from the successful ﬁlament eruption."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging (not specified in wavelength units, as is typical for coronagraph observations)
- **Physical Observable**: The spatial development and height evolution of CME structures.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "their corresponding CMEs are observed by LASCO C2 in e) and f)..."
- **Additional Comments**: Although exact time stamps are not provided beyond the context of the flare and filament timelines, LASCO observations are used to corroborate the CME association with the sympathetic eruptions.

### 4. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI provides full-disk magnetograms and vector magnetic field data which are essential for reconstructing the coronal field and calculating the decay index of magnetic fields above filaments.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "we also calculated F1’s decay index in a potential ﬁeld based only on Bz of the active region, provided by hmi.sharp cea data series from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2011; Scherrer et al. 2012) on-board SDO..."
  
#### Data Collection Period: Pre-flare Magnetic Field Mapping
- **Time Range**: The data used corresponds to a pre-flare period as part of the PFSS modeling, with the synoptic map updated every 6 hours. (Exact dates/times are not explicitly stated.)
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "the lower boundary of the PFSS model, i.e., the synoptic map of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, is updated every 6 hours..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetogram data measuring the line-of-sight or vector magnetic field).
- **Physical Observable**: The photospheric magnetic field (Bz) and its distribution used to reconstruct and model the coronal field.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "calculated the decay index, n = −d ln B/d ln h, right above the three ﬁlaments by manually picking points along each ﬁlament visible in 304˚A." (while the 304˚A images come from AIA, the magnetic field reconstruction relies on HMI data)
- **Additional Comments**: HMI data are critical for distinguishing the magnetic field contributions of the active region and the surrounding quiet Sun, thereby affecting the modeling of filament stability.
