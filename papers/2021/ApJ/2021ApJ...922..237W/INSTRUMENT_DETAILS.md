## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on GRB 210121A – a gamma‐ray burst detected by multiple missions – and presents a detailed temporal and spectral analysis using data from several high–energy observatories. Key observational inputs include trigger times, multi–wavelength light curves, and time–resolved spectra from a variety of detectors. The study combines data from small CubeSat missions as well as well–established instruments (e.g., Fermi/GBM, HXMT/HE, and GECAM) to constrain properties such as the GRB duration (T90 ≃ 13.31 s), spectral indices, peak energy, and to test theoretical models (photosphere vs synchrotron). The paper also uses interplanetary triangulation (via Konus–Wind annuli) for localization and reports a candidate host galaxy based on optical follow–up imaging with LCOGT.
