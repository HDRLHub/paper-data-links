## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on analyzing the variations in the timing of the Sun's polar magnetic field reversals through observations and surface flux transport (SFT) simulations. It examines solar magnetograms from four different instruments over the last four solar cycles to interpret the polar field observations accurately and determine the reversal times. The study highlights the absence of triple (multipolar) reversals in Cycles 21 – 24, variations in the time interval between reversals in different hemispheres, and the interval between a reversal and the beginning of a cycle. The paper also discusses the impact of 'anomalous' bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) on the timing of reversals, using SFT simulations to understand the cycle-to-cycle variations.
