## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the evolution of magnetic fields and energy release processes during three homologous eruptive solar flares of increasing intensities (M2.0, M2.6, and X1.0) from NOAA active region 12017 on March 28-29, 2014. The study utilizes multi-wavelength and multi-instrument data, including EUV observations, magnetograms, and coronal magnetic field modeling, to explore the build-up and explosive release of magnetic energy and the formation of magnetic flux ropes. The analysis reveals the role of photospheric magnetic field variations and coronal changes in triggering these flares, suggesting a tether-cutting mechanism as the plausible trigger. The paper also discusses the coupling between the rapidly evolving photospheric and coronal magnetic fields, leading to the build-up of free energy and resulting in the homologous flares.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA was used for EUV imaging and analysis, providing crucial data on the chromosphere, transition region, and corona of the Sun.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the chromosphere and transition region
- **Time Range**: Continuous observation during the flares on 2014 March 28–29
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For our analysis, we use the EUV 304 ˚A [log(T) ≈4.7] and 193 ˚A [log(T) ≈6.2, 7.3] observations."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 ˚A, 193 ˚A
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The 304 ˚A images provide information of the chromosphere and transition region of the Sun, while the 193 ˚A images are used to analyze the corona and hot flare plasma."
- **Physical Observable**: Chromosphere and transition region structures, coronal loops, and flare plasma
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The EUV images at 171 and 193 ˚A readily suggest the existence of large coronal loops connecting the leading and trailing parts of the AR."

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provided data for investigating the evolution of the photosphere through line-of-sight magnetogram and continuum observations.
