## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a broadband X‑ray spectroscopic analysis of bursts from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, with a focus on comparing 24 bursts observed simultaneously by NASA’s NICER and Fermi/GBM with a unique FRB-associated X‑ray burst (FRB-X). The study spans observations during an active burst storm phase on April 28, 2020, where NICER recorded over 200 X‑ray bursts during a ~19‑minute observation, and Fermi/GBM monitored a subset of 24 bright bursts. In addition, the FRB‑X was detected by several other instruments (INTEGRAL, KONUS‑WIND, HXMT) and radio telescopes (CHIME, STARE2) approximately 13 hours after the NICER observation, providing a basis for detailed spectral and temporal comparisons that help establish the magnetar as the origin of fast radio bursts.

### 1. NICER X‑ray Timing Instrument on board the International Space Station (ISS)
- **General Comments**:
  - NICER is a non‑imaging X‑ray timing instrument operating in the 0.2–12 keV energy band. It utilizes 56 coaligned X‑ray concentrating optics paired with Focal Plane Module (FPM) detectors (52 currently active) and is optimized for capturing low‑background X‑ray burst data.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “We observed SGR J1935+2154 with the NICER X‑ray Timing Instrument (0.2–12 keV) onboard the International Space Station on April 28, from 00:40:58 UTC until 00:59:36 UTC (~19 minutes)...”

    - **Supporting Quote**: “NICER observed SGR J1935+2154 on April 28th 2020 with several uninterrupted snapshots. The first covers the period from 00:40:58 UTC until 00:59:36 UTC, or approximately 19 minutes.”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: 0.2–12 keV
    - **Supporting Quote**: “NICER ... is sensitive to photon energies in the range of 0.2–12 keV...”

### 2. Fermi Gamma‑ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi Gamma‑ray Space Telescope
- **General Comments**:
  - GBM is equipped with 12 Sodium-Iodide (NaI) detectors and 2 Bismuth Germanate (BGO) detectors, covering a broad energy range from 8 keV up to 30 MeV. It continuously monitors the sky and can capture high‑energy burst emissions.

  - **Additional Comments**: Due to a higher background than NICER, GBM data provided a complementary high‑energy view, and its continuous time‑tagged event (CTTE) data with 2 microsecond time resolution enabled the detection of the same bursts seen by NICER.

### 3. INTEGRAL
- **General Comments**:
  - INTEGRAL is a spaceborne observatory designed to detect high‑energy emissions, and it was one of the three missions that detected the unique FRB‑associated X‑ray burst (FRB‑X).

    - **Supporting Quote**: “...a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) was detected with the CHIME and STARE2 radio telescopes, though no persistent pulsed radio emission was observed in subsequent observations by FAST. The FRB‑associated X‑ray burst (FRB‑X) was detected by the INTEGRAL, KONUS‑WIND, and HXMT missions; NICER and GBM were not observing the source during that time.”
  - **Wavelength(s)**: High‑energy X‑rays; specific range not detailed but implied to extend into the hard X‑ray band.

    - **Supporting Quote**: “...the FRB‑X burst... exhibiting a much higher cutoff energy and a significantly steeper PL component.”

### 8. FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope)
- **General Comments**:
  - FAST is a sensitive radio telescope used for follow‑up observations of the FRB event. It did not detect any persistent pulsed radio emission following the FRB despite its high sensitivity.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “...though no persistent pulsed radio emission was observed in subsequent observations by FAST.”
  
- **Data Collection Period 1: Follow‑up Observations**
  - **Time Range**: The context does not provide a specific time range for FAST observations; it refers to “subsequent observations.”
