## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper conducts a detailed comparative analysis of multiple sunspot catalogues—the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD), the SDO/HMI Debrecen Data (HMIDD), and the SOHO/MDI Debrecen Data, along with a rederived Greenwich catalogue (GPD) based on digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) images. The main research objective is to assess systematic differences in sunspot area measurements resulting from image quality, instrument characteristics, and cataloguing practices by direct, statistical comparison of sunspot areas (whole spot, umbra, and total area) extracted from these different data sources. The study focuses on overlapping periods, particularly 2012 for comparisons involving space-based and ground-based instruments, and 1974–1976 for comparative analysis involving the Greenwich and Debrecen catalogues. Observations from the SDO/HMI (Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager), SOHO/MDI (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager), ground-based Gyula and Debrecen observatories, and digitized RGO images form the core data for analyses. The paper describes precisely how data from each instrument form the basis for statistical evaluation and cross-calibration and underpins the quantitative results.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The SDO/HMI provides magnetic and white-light images that are directly used to compile the SDO/HMI Debrecen Data (HMIDD) and are a primary basis for comparison with ground-based (DPD) and SOHO/MDI sunspot catalogues for the year 2012.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The SDO/HMI Debrecen Data (HMIDD) uses the magnetic and white-light images taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson & Chamberlin 2012)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Comparative analysis for 2012 against DPD
- **Time Range**: 2012-01-01 – 2012-12-31 (Year 2012; co-temporal HMI and DPD image pairs)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "2087 images taken in 2012 in Gyula were used. The HMI catalogue was based on the HMI quasi-continuum and the magnetic images that were near co-temporal with the DPD ones."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly stated, but "white-light" and "magnetic" channels
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The SDO/HMI Debrecen Data (HMIDD) uses the magnetic and white-light images taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson & Chamberlin 2012)."
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot area (whole spot and umbra), feature number, position (heliographic coordinates), and temporal evolution in sunspot statistics
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Comparing sunspot areas measured in almost co-temporal (below 1 min apart) HMI and DPD images provides an excellent possibility for studying how the seeing affects the measured area of the sunspots."

### Gyula Observatory and Debrecen Observatory (Ground-based telescopes for DPD)
- **General Comments**:
  - Ground-based white-light solar images taken in Gyula and Debrecen are the primary data source for the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) catalogue, especially for the year 2012, which is directly compared to SDO/HMI data.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) are mainly based on solar images taken in Gyula and Debrecen observatories (Gy˝ori, Baranyi & Ludm´any 2011; Baranyi, Gy˝ori & Ludm´any 2016)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Comparative analysis for 2012 against SDO/HMI
- **Time Range**: 2012-01-01 – 2012-12-31 (Year 2012)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For the DPD catalogue, all 2087 images taken in 2012 in Gyula were used."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light photographic images
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) are mainly based on solar images taken in Gyula and Debrecen observatories..."
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot area (total, umbra), feature numbers, heliographic positions
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The area and position data of sunspots are widely used to study various aspects of solar activity, e.g. emergence, growth, and decay of spots..."

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
  - MDI's white-light and magnetic images are directly used in the SOHO/MDI Debrecen Data (SDD) catalogue, which is compared with DPD and HMI-based catalogues in areas with overlapping time periods (explicitly referenced in methodological and calibration contexts).
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The SOHO/MDI Debrecen data (SDD) are based on the magnetic and white-light images taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Scherrer et al. 1995) with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Used for catalogue overlap/inter-calibration (exact dates not strictly defined, but contextually during SOHO MDIs operational period and specifically for tabled comparisons)
- **Time Range**: Referenced in comparisons with DPD and HMI, contextually 2000–2002 for alignment checks
  - **Supporting Quote**: "As a counter check, we determined the rotation angle between the DPD and the MDI images for 2000, 2001 and 2002."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light and magnetic
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The SOHO/MDI Debrecen data (SDD) are based on the magnetic and white-light images taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Scherrer et al. 1995) with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument."
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot area, position, alignment
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We found that the MDI images are rotated by 0.197◦relative to the DPD ones."

### Digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) Photoheliograms
- **General Comments**:
  - RGO photographic plates for 1974–1976 were digitized and directly analyzed to create the Greenwich Photoheliographic Data (GPD) catalogue, which was then cross-compared against revised DPD catalogues for those years.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "...the Greenwich Photoheliographic Data, from the digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory images for 1974–76."

#### Data Collection Period 1: 1974–01–01 to 1976–12–31 (1974, 1975, 1976)
- **Time Range**: 1974-01-01 – 1976-12-31 (RGO image-based sunspot analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Greenwich Photoheliographic Data, from the digitized Royal Greenwich Observatory images for 1974–76."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (photographic observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the RGO photographic images are 19 cm in diameter, while the DPD ones are only 10 cm in diameter. The emulsion type and its gamma are probably different between the two sets of images."
- **Physical Observable**: Sunspot area, feature number, heliographic positions
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The GPR daily total corrected sunspot areas are about 2.5 per cent smaller than those of the DPDr."
