produce the script. We need to construct queries for downloading data from the SDO/HMI, SOHO/MDI, and BBSO Hα observations. Given the specific time ranges and wavelengths mentioned in the context, we will focus on these parameters to tailor our queries. For SDO/HMI, we're interested in the full disk Doppler velocities, LOS magnetograms, and continuum proxy images at 6173 Å from May 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017. For SOHO/MDI, the focus is on full disk LOS magnetograms during the overlapping period with HMI, which is from May 1, 2010, to April 11, 2011. Lastly, for BBSO Hα observations, we aim to retrieve full disk observations at 6563 Å from May 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017. Given these requirements, we will construct our queries accordingly.
