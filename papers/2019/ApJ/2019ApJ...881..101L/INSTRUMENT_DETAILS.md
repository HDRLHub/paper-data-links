## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a systematic comparison of various operational solar flare forecasting methods. The study examines the differences in implementation details—from the data used (and how they are treated), to the specifics of training, forecast production, and forecast issuance—and their impact on forecast performance. Many of the methods rely on observational data from modern instruments (such as SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA, and GOES) as well as backup observations (e.g., from GONG, PROBA2/SWAP, PROBA2/LYRA, STEREO/EUVI, and SOHO/MDI). Although the paper primarily focuses on the forecast evaluation metrics and the implementation nuances across the methods, several time ranges are mentioned in the context of training intervals and data usage. These include intervals such as 2012.10.22 – 2015.12.31 (for HMI near real-time data usage), 2006.09.01 – 2015.12.31 (for the GONG era), 2010.05.01 – 2015.12.31 (for HMI definitive data), and older intervals for SOHO/MDI data (e.g., 1996 – 2004 and 1996–2010). The paper thus leverages both modern and historical observations to operationally forecast solar flares while evaluating the impact of instrument selection and data quality on forecast performance.
