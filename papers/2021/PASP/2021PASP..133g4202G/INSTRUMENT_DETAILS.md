## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes the timing of soft gamma‐ray bursts (SGBs) from the magnetar SGR1935+2154 and investigates whether their burst times exhibit periodic windowed behavior (PWB). The study compares bursts recorded over several years (from 2014 through 2020) by a variety of high‐energy and radio instruments. In particular, it focuses on burst episodes detected in gamma‐ray bands by instruments that are part of the Interplanetary Network (IPN)—including those onboard Wind, Swift, Integral, Fermi, and Agile—as well as simultaneous detections of fast radio bursts (FRBs) by CHIME/FRB and STARE 2 during the event of 2020 April 28. The paper leverages the excellent time coverage provided by these instruments to evaluate periodicity in the SGB arrival times.
