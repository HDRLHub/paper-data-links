## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the formation and characteristics of solar spicules, which are plasma jets observed in the dynamic interface region between the visible solar surface and the hot corona. The study draws parallels between the behavior of spicules in the solar atmosphere and jets in polymeric fluids subjected to harmonic forcing. The research utilizes radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations with sub-surface convection to replicate the conditions on the Sun and compares these simulations with laboratory experiments on polymeric fluids. The primary data sources include synthetic emission from the simulations and observational data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). The study spans various time periods and frequencies to explore the conditions under which spicules form and their physical properties.

## Instrumentation Details

### Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)
- **General Comments**:
   - IRIS is used to observe spicules at the solar limb, particularly focusing on the Si IV 140 nm and Mg II k 279.6 nm lines, which correspond to plasma temperatures of approximately 80,000 K and 15,000 K, respectively.
- **Supporting Quote**: "A typical forest of observed jets is shown in Si IV 140 nm (plasma temperature ∼80000 K) images sampled at the solar limb by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph–IRIS."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of spicules at the solar limb
- **Time Range**: February 21, 2014, starting at 11:24:46 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We used a series of spicule image sequences obtained with the IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) at 11:24:46, on February 21, 2014."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Si IV 140 nm and Mg II k 279.6 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The investigated area is located in the south pole of the Sun with the center solar coordinates of xS = 7′′and yS = 969′′with a field-of-view (FOV) of 119′′×119′′. For our work, we analysed spicules observed with the transition region Si IV 140.0 nm (at T≈80000 K) and the chromospheric Mg II k 279.6 nm (at T≈15000 K) slit-jaw filtergrams with a 19 s cadence."
- **Physical Observable**: Spicule heights, velocities, and emission intensities
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The simulated spicule heights, as measured by synthetic emission peaked at a temperature of 15000 K (see Extended Data Fig. 3d), vary between 6 −24.6 megameters (Mm) with an average of 12.6 Mm and maximum upward velocities between 30 −85 km s−1, quantitatively agreeing with the statistics of observed spicules."

### Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA is used to map the lower solar corona, particularly focusing on the 17.1 nm filter, which corresponds to plasma temperatures of approximately 1 million K.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The computational results from one representative simulation run performed in a 2D box is visualized using synthetic emission from the plasma at a temperature of 80000 K (Fig. 2b, also see Supplementary Video 6), which portrays the upper chromosphere, and using the temperature response function of the 17.1 nm filter of the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), which maps the lower solar corona."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the lower solar corona
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated, but inferred to be concurrent with IRIS observations
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The computational results from one representative simulation run performed in a 2D box is visualized using synthetic emission from the plasma at a temperature of 80000 K (Fig. 2b, also see Supplementary Video 6), which portrays the upper chromosphere, and using the temperature response function of the 17.1 nm filter of the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), which maps the lower solar corona."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17.1 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A typical forest of observed jets is shown in Si IV 140 nm (plasma temperature ∼80000 K) images sampled at the solar limb by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph–IRIS (see Fig. 2a where an example spicule is denoted by the arrow labelled ‘S1’ and Extended Fig. 3a for a wider field of view). The simulated forest of spicules (panel b) qualitatively agrees well with the spicule forest from observations (panel a)."
- **Physical Observable**: Emission intensities and spicule structures
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The enhanced emission can be further seen in the time-distance maps of both observed and simulated spicules (Fig. 2a–c) whereas the shorter spicules do not have discernible emission at the tip."

### Pencil Code (Numerical Simulations)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Pencil Code is used for radiative MHD simulations to model the solar atmosphere and the formation of spicules under various conditions, including harmonic forcing and sub-surface convection.
- **Supporting Quote**: "To begin with, we perform an ensemble of 2-dimensional numerical experiments on the solar atmosphere using the Pencil code (see Methods), wherein a harmonic forcing is applied just below the photosphere."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Harmonic forcing simulations
- **Time Range**: Various frequencies and amplitudes, specific runs not explicitly dated
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We then observe only small-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortex plumes instead of jets, as shown in Fig. 1c. Interestingly, anisotropy created in an artificial manner by introducing a horizontal velocity damping at zero field also results in the reappearance of jets in the undamped vertical direction (see also Extended Data Fig. 2)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (numerical simulation)
- **Physical Observable**: Spicule formation, heights, velocities, and magnetic field effects
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The simulated spicule heights, as measured by synthetic emission peaked at a temperature of 15000 K (see Extended Data Fig. 3d), vary between 6 −24.6 megameters (Mm) with an average of 12.6 Mm and maximum upward velocities between 30 −85 km s−1, quantitatively agreeing with the statistics of observed spicules."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Sub-surface convection simulations
- **Time Range**: Various runs, specific times not explicitly dated
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In order to demonstrate the utility of this model for solar spicules, we introduce a solar-like convective layer below the photosphere. The computational results from one representative simulation run performed in a 2D box is visualized using synthetic emission from the plasma at a temperature of 80000 K (Fig. 2b, also see Supplementary Video 6), which portrays the upper chromosphere, and using the temperature response function of the 17.1 nm filter of the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), which maps the lower solar corona (Fig. 2c)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (numerical simulation)
- **Physical Observable**: Spicule formation, heights, velocities, and magnetic field effects
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The simulated spicule heights, as measured by synthetic emission peaked at a temperature of 15000 K (see Extended Data Fig. 3d), vary between 6 −24.6 megameters (Mm) with an average of 12.6 Mm and maximum upward velocities between 30 −85 km s−1, quantitatively agreeing with the statistics of observed spicules."

### Faraday Excitation Experiments (Laboratory)
- **General Comments**:
   - Laboratory experiments on polymeric fluids subjected to harmonic forcing to draw parallels with solar spicule formation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For comparison, we conduct a series of table-top experiments on a dilute polymeric solution of polyethylene oxide (PEO) excited using a speaker at low audio frequencies."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Harmonic forcing of polymeric fluids
- **Time Range**: Various frequencies and amplitudes, specific times not explicitly dated
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For forced vertical acceleration with a time dependence, A0 sin(2πf0t), the Amin at each f0, where the above forest of jets criteria is satisfied, is arrived at by carrying out a series of individual experiments by sampling the amplitude, A0, corresponding to each f0."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (laboratory experiment)
- **Physical Observable**: Jet formation, heights, and fluid dynamics
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The behaviour of the Amin −f0 curve in region R2 (see Fig. 1b) is similar in both cases. In the fluid, for low driving frequencies (i.e. < fs = 25 Hz or region R1), the acceleration threshold for jets shows a flattening w.r.t. f0."
