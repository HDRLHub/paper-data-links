produce the script. We need to construct a query that specifically targets the WISPR instrument on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) for the observation of small-scale eddy features in the wake of a CME. The context provided specifies the exact time range and the type of physical observable (intensity in white light), which corresponds to the capabilities of the WISPR instrument as listed in the VSO interface. Given the detailed time range and the specific nature of the observations, we can directly use these parameters to form our query.
