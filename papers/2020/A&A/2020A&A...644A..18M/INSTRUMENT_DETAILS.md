## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the differential rotation of the solar corona during a period of solar minimum preceding solar cycle 23. The authors analyze ultraviolet spectral line intensities from several prominent coronal lines over a 400‐day interval (from 1996 April 4 to 1997 May 15) to infer the latitudinal dependence of the coronal rotation rate. Two main analysis methods are employed: the generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram and a data‐adaptive multivariate technique called multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). The study uses observations collected with instruments sensitive to distinct UV wavelengths, and comparisons are made with Doppler and helioseismic measurements obtained by other instruments. These various datasets and measurement techniques provide complementary information on both the UV coronal emission and the rotation properties of the underlying solar layers.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - UVCS is an internally and externally occulted coronagraph that is equipped with two toric grating spectrometers (channels). It is designed to observe selected ultraviolet spectral lines in the solar corona.
   - It routinely operates in a synoptic observing mode. One channel is optimized for H i Lyα 1216 Å (the “LYA channel”), and the other is optimized for O vi measurements (the “OVI channel”), which also permits detection of second-order lines in the 492–540 Å spectral range.
   - Its setup allows the measurement of spectral line intensities that include contributions from both collisional excitation and resonant scattering processes.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The data were acquired by SOHO/UVCS, which is an internally and externally occulted coronagraph consisting of two toric grating spectrometers (channels) for the observation of spectral lines in the UV range... For this work, we considered data taken from both UVCS channels, that is, the LYA channel (optimized for line measurements of H i Lyα 1216 Å), and the OVI channel (optimized for measurements of O vi 1032 Å and O vi 1037 Å). This latter channel was also used for the detection of spectral lines in the 492 Å to 540 Å (second-order) spectral range.”

   - **Supporting Quote**: “In particular, we selected a 400-day observation period, from 1996 April 4 to 1997 May 15…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - O vi 1032 Å, O vi 1037 Å, Si xii 499 Å, Si xii 521 Å, and H i Lyα 1216 Å  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...a set of simultaneous 400-day long spectral line intensities of five different spectral lines: O vi 1032 Å, O vi 1037 Å, Si xii 499 Å, Si xii 521 Å, and H i Lyα 1216 Å, which are routinely observed by UVCS.”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Ultraviolet line intensities that trace both collisional and radiative processes occurring in the corona; these measurements are used to analyze coronal rotation through the modulation of emission due to stable, large-scale coronal structures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The rotation period of the extended corona can be conveniently measured by using observations of ultraviolet (UV) spectral lines that are sensitive to coronal activity.”

- **Additional Comments**:
   - The instrument’s daily synoptic observations and the configuration of its two channels allow simultaneous measurement of spectral lines formed at different temperatures, thereby enabling the study of various plasma components in the corona.

### 2. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO (Solar Oscillations Investigation – SOI/MDI)

   - Not explicitly stated; the instrument primarily measures Doppler shifts (e.g., in the visible band for the Fe i line, among others).

   - The helioseismic data acquired by MDI provide a reference for the rotational properties of solar interior layers, enabling comparison with the rotation inferred from UV coronal emissions.

### 3. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)

   - AIA is a multiwavelength imager that observes the solar corona in several extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels.
   - It is mentioned in the context of planned future investigations aimed at applying a similar multivariate, data-adaptive analysis to EUV observations. 

- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...we are planning a similar inquiry that will involve a multiwavelength study of the rotation of the inner corona as evinced by a data-adaptive, multivariate analysis of the intensity variations detected in all coronal extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on-board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012).”

### 4. Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) Telescope System
- **General Comments**:
   - The MWO telescope system has been used for obtaining doppler measurements of the Fe i spectral line at 5250 Å, which are essential for determining the differential rotation of the solar photosphere.
