1. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - HMI is used extensively to provide the solar surface magnetic field measurements. Its full-disk measurements are a key resource in inferring the positions of magnetic origination points (MOPs) and in applying the UBT (Ulrich‚ÄìBoyden‚ÄìTran) analysis that combines line‚Äêof‚Äêsight data with projection corrections.

     - ‚Äú...magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft‚Ä¶‚Äù  
   - **Data Collection Period**:  
     - **Time Range**: 2011/01/07 ‚Äì 2012/12/31  
       - **Supporting Quote**: ‚Äú...we use the derived data series from Ulrich and Tran (2016) available as described in section 4.6. This series begins 2011/01/07 so that the study period is from 2011/01/07 to the end of the MFI catalogue at 2012/12/31.‚Äù  
   - **Detector, Wavelength(s), and Physical Observable**:  
     - **Detector/Method**: Full-disk magnetograph that measures the line-of-sight magnetic field (with additional derivations used to estimate the east/west component through the UBT analysis).  
     - **Physical Observable**: The solar surface (photospheric) magnetic field‚Äîwhich is used to determine radial magnetic field components (Br), the transverse (east-west) field (Bùúô), and from these, an index proportional to the current helicity density (IH).

2. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - AIA is employed to capture detailed images of the solar atmosphere including the chromosphere, transition region, and the low corona. It provides multi-wavelength images that are used to identify moving loops, arches, and dimming associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - ‚ÄúNASA‚Äôs Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) carries two investigations that we use extensively‚Ä¶ These investigations are the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; ‚Ä¶) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2012). AIA provides images of the chromosphere, transition region, and the low corona using four telescopes with seven EUV channels and three longer wavelength channels. In our use of these images we designate them as AIA-XXX where XXX is the filter wavelength in √Ö.‚Äù  
   - **Data Collection Details**:  
     - **Time Range**: While an explicit start‚Äìend date is not separately given for AIA, its observations for this study align with the SDO operational period used here (i.e., during the 2011/01/07 to 2012/12/31 window defined by the HMI data).  
   - **Detector, Wavelength(s), and Physical Observable**:  
     - **Detector**: Four telescopes aboard SDO equipped with seven EUV channels and additional channels for longer wavelengths.  
     - **Wavelength(s)**: Specific filter designations such as AIA-171 (used to view cooler structures and track loop motion), AIA-335 (highlighting hotter features including flare channels), and AIA-193 are mentioned.  
     - **Physical Observable**: EUV brightness and dynamic changes (e.g., outward motion of loops, coronal dimming) used to identify the initiation and evolution of CMEs.

3. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)/C2 on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - LASCO/C2 is utilized to observe the corona in white light and is a primary tool for identifying CMEs as they leave the solar vicinity. The instrument provides imagery that captures halo and partial halo structures, which are essential candidates for those CMEs that eventually reach 1 AU near Earth.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - ‚ÄúWe also use the CDAW (Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop) catalogue maintained by the LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) team to identify the CMEs as they leave the vicinity of the sun. We primarily use images from the LASCO/C2 telescope, which is on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft.‚Äù  
   - **Data Collection Period**:  
     - **Time Range**: No distinct start and end dates are given for LASCO/C2 in this study. Its observations are used in a candidate selection process in conjunction with the timing of CME events derived from the MFI table and adjusted by CME ejection models.  
   - **Detector, Wavelength(s), and Physical Observable**:  
     - **Detector**: Coronagraph that images the solar corona in white light.  
     - **Physical Observable**: Visible light structures of CMEs (particularly halo or partial-halo events) as they propagate outward from the sun.

4. Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) on board NASA‚Äôs Wind Spacecraft  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - The MFI instrument, operated by the Magnetic Field Investigation team, is responsible for in situ measurements of magnetic clouds at 1 AU. The extensive ‚ÄúMFI table‚Äù lists magnetic cloud events with detailed properties (e.g., cloud start/end times, helicity, and magnetic field strength).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - ‚Äú...the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) team supporting NASA‚Äôs Wind spacecraft (Lepping et al., 1995) prepared an extensive listing of identified magnetic clouds and their properties covering the years 1995 to 2012‚Ä¶‚Äù  
   - **Data Collection Period**:  
     - **Time Range**: 1995 ‚Äì 2012 (with the present study restricting analysis to entries after the beginning of 2011)  
       - **Supporting Context**: ‚Äú...we could only analyze MFI entries after the beginning of 2011.‚Äù  
   - **Detector, Wavelength(s), and Physical Observable**:  
     - **Detector**: Magnetic field sensors on the Wind spacecraft that measure the vector magnetic field in interplanetary space.  
     - **Physical Observable**: The magnetic field of interplanetary magnetic clouds‚Äîincluding the helicity, orientation, and strength‚Äîwhich are used in conjunction with solar surface observations to predict cloud helicity.
