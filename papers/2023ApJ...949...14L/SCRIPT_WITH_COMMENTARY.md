### Explanation:
1. **Time Range**: The script uses the exact time range provided in the context, which is critical for ensuring that the data corresponds to Carrington Rotation 2002 during which the observations were made.
2. **Instruments and Physical Observables**: The script specifies queries for the Wind and ACE spacecraft. For Wind, it assumes a placeholder physical observable 'magnetic_field' that should be replaced with the actual observable name if different. For ACE, it uses 'ionic_composition' similarly.
3. **Query Execution**: The `Fido.search` function is used to construct the queries based on the specified parameters. The results are printed to verify the query details.
4. **Data Download**: The actual downloading of the data is commented out to prevent execution without user confirmation and to ensure that the script is used for query construction only as per the directive.

This script is tailored to the specific needs of the study as described in the context, focusing on the instruments and types of data relevant to the research on solar wind properties.
