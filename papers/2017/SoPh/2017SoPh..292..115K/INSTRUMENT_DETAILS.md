## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on the detection and analysis of solar neutrons associated with solar flares on March 5, 7, 9, and 13, 2012, using the fiber-type neutron monitor (FIB) component of the Neutron Monitor (NEM) on board the SEDA-AP instrument package attached to the International Space Station (ISS). The study provides time profiles of neutron emissions, with a primary focus on the event of March 5, 2012. The researchers analyze neutron arrival times, directions, and production times in the context of solar flare activity, with additional use of ultraviolet images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to correlate neutron data with solar surface magnetic activity. The SEDA-AP FIB provided the direct particle detection data, while the SDO provided contextual imaging at specific wavelengths to interpret acceleration scenarios.

## Instrumentation Details

### Fiber-type Neutron Monitor (FIB) on board SEDA-AP attached to the ISS
- **General Comments**:
  - The FIB detector was used to directly detect and measure the energy, arrival time, and direction of solar neutrons during several major solar flare events in March 2012, with specialized focus on the events of March 5, 2012.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this study, we present the time profiles of those neutrons and discuss the physics that may be related to a possible acceleration scenario for ions over the solar surface."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detection of solar neutrons during solar flares in March 2012
- **Time Range**: 2012-03-05, 2012-03-07, 2012-03-09, and 2012-03-13 (solar flare events); with detailed analysis for March 5, 2012, including ISS eclipse and sunshine periods (eclipsed from 03:47UT to 04:17UT; sunshine from 04:17UT to 05:17UT).
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Signals of solar neutrons were detected in the flare of March5 (X1.1), March 7 (X5.4), March 9 (M6.3), and March 13 (M7.9)."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The SEDA-AP was eclipsed from 03:47UT to 04:17UT, and passed through the sunshine region from 04:17UT to 05:17UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (neutrons observed in energy range 35–120 MeV)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The other a fiber-type neutron monitor (FIB), which can measure energies from 35 to 120 MeV. In this paper, the results of measurement by the FIB are reported."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar neutron arrival time, direction, and energy.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We report the details of the SEDA-AP instrument, as well as the result of neutron measurements, focusing especially on the interesting event of the solar flare on March 5, 2012."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The first distribution indicates a start time of 03:52UT and the second distribution starts at 04:38UT. Therefore, protons are accelerated into high energies instantaneously when electrons are accelerated and produce hard X-rays."
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument’s data were specifically analyzed for neutron energy and direction using two analysis methods (dynode sum and range method), with energy-dependent resolution and track reconstruction.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The energy resolution using dynode sum is under 39%, and that using the range of light is from 23% to 4% according to the energy range from 35 MeV to 100 MeV... Neutron energy is measured using the recoiled proton track inner FIB with the relation En = Ep/cosθ."

### Ultraviolet Telescope on board SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
  - Images from the SDO ultraviolet telescope were directly used to correlate neutron emission times with observable features (magnetic loop collisions, plasma events) at the solar surface, particularly at specific ultraviolet wavelengths.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We compare our data with the dynamical pictures of the flares obtained by the ultra-violet telescope of the space-based Solar Dynamics Observatory."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Ultraviolet photos corresponding to neutron production times
- **Time Range**: 2012-03-05, with critical time points at 03:52 UT and 04:38 UT (UV imaging contextually paired with solar neutron detections)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Then, at the corresponding times around 03:52 UT and 04:38 UT, we found typical features of the magnetic loops: collision by the rising loop and formation of an x-type crossing structure and another collision between two standing magnetic loops, forming an Upsilon-type (Υ) collision between the magnetic loops."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 nm (ultraviolet), and 314 nm (used for ~03:55 UT contextual analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The wavelength used in these pictures is 171 nm."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "According to the photograph taken at this time (03:55UT) by the SDO telescope with a wavelength of 314 nm, the x-type crossing structure between the two loops can be seen at the position (X= −770 arcsec, Y= 370 arcsec)."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar surface morphology (magnetic loop collisions, plasma eruptions)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "With the solar neutron production time having been obtained from our observations, we carefully investigated the photos taken by the ultraviolet telescope onboard the SDO satellite."
- **Additional Comments**: SDO ultraviolet images at specified wavelengths were used (not merely cited), with event-timed snapshots enabling physical correlation with neutron data.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Fig 8 represents the flight direction distribution of the measurement data... The left-hand side of Fig.8 shows the location of the first flare (03:52UT). The wavelength used in these pictures is 171 nm."
