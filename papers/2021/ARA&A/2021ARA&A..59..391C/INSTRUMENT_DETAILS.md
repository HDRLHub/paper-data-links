# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

This review paper presents multi-wavelength observations of classical novae and their shock‐powered emission. The paper discusses results from instruments spanning the gamma‐ray, X‑ray, optical, and radio bands. Below is a detailed list of the instruments mentioned in the paper along with their observed time ranges, wavelength/energy regimes, specific detectors, and the primary physical observables they measure.

- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** Approximately 0.1–10 GeV (gamma-rays).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Gamma-ray detections in novae typically last for several weeks.
  - Table S1 lists detection durations (e.g., ~17 days for V1324 Sco, ~22 days for V407 Cyg and V959 Mon, up to ~55 days for some events).
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - The Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects continuum gamma-ray emission.
  - Measures spectral properties (photon indices in the range ≈1.3–2.3 with possible exponential cutoffs around a few GeV) and luminosities (≈10^34–10^36 erg/s).
  - Provides high signal-to-noise gamma-ray light curves that are correlated with optical flares.

### 2. Swift-XRT on the Swift Observatory
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** 1–10 keV (soft to hard X-rays).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Hard X-ray emission becomes detectable roughly one month after the nova eruption.
  - Figure 11 shows Swift-XRT data (measurements and upper limits) spanning from about 30 days to several hundred days post-eruption.
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**

### 3. NuSTAR
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** 3–79 keV (hard X-rays).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - NuSTAR observations are reported concurrently with Fermi-LAT gamma-ray detections—typically during the early shock phase (generally within a few weeks after eruption).
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Provides sensitive measurements of hard X-ray emission.
  - Determines plasma temperatures (kT ≈6–11 keV) and assesses high absorbing column densities, helping to differentiate shock emission from the supersoft (burning) component.

### 4. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** Radio frequencies, approximately 1 GHz to 33 GHz.
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Multi-epoch radio observations capture both early non-thermal (synchrotron) and later thermal (free-free) emission.
  - Example: In nova V1324 Sco, the early radio maximum (non-thermal, synchrotron) occurs around day ~70, followed by a thermal maximum near one year after eruption.
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Measures radio flux densities, spectral indices, and brightness temperatures.
  - Provides imaging that reveals the structure and evolution of ejecta (differentiating between clumpy, shock-accelerated regions and smoother thermal regions).

### 5. European VLBI Network (EVN)
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** Radio wavelengths (via very long baseline interferometry).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Specific imaging sessions are noted on Day 91 and Day 113 (e.g., for nova V959 Mon) to study the high-resolution structure of synchrotron “knots.”
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Offers milliarcsecond-scale resolution to map fine details of the radio emission arising from shock interactions.
  - Allows determination of spatial locations and sizes of regions associated with particle acceleration.

### 7. Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** Optical wavelengths (typically using narrow-band filters such as Hα + [N II]).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Used for late-time imaging of nova ejecta; the paper mentions imaging typically in the range of approximately 5–50 years after eruption.
  - For example, eclipsing individual nova shells such as that of V842 Cen have been studied with HST.
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Provides extremely high spatial resolution optical images.
  - Reveals structural details of ejecta including clumpy, elliptical shells, bipolar outflows, and equatorial rings.

### 8. BRITE Constellation
- **Wavelength/Energy Range:** Optical (R-band photometry).
- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Utilized to capture high-cadence optical light curves during the shock phase.
  - For example, the optical light curve of V906 Car obtained by BRITE shows distinct flares that are correlated with gamma-ray peaks.
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Precisely measures optical brightness variations.
  - Detects rapid variations associated with shock-powered reprocessing of energy.

### 11. IceCube Neutrino Observatory

- **Time Ranges and Observational Context:**
  - Operates continuously; the paper refers to integration times over several weeks during which novae are expected to emit neutrinos if hadronic processes occur.
- **Detectors/Physical Observables:**
  - Sensitive to neutrinos produced from pion decay in hadronic shocks.
  - Although current sensitivities are several orders of magnitude above predicted nova neutrino fluxes, IceCube provides important upper limits and cross-checks for particle acceleration mechanisms.

**Additional Future Instrumentation Mentioned:**

These instruments collectively allow for a comprehensive, multi-epoch, and multi-wavelength investigation of nova eruptions and the physics of radiative shocks.
