## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates long- and mid-term temporal variations in the type of soft X-ray solar flares across Solar Cycles 21, 22, 23, and 24, with a focus on the proportion and parameters of short-duration (SDE) and long-duration (LDE) flares. The primary data source is soft X-ray observations from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), specifically in the 1–8 Å wavelength range, covering the period from 1976 through 2016. Flare temporal parameters (rise time, decay time, and duration) and class (C1.0–C9.9, ≥M1.0) were directly analyzed using tabular event lists and time profiles, with cycle phase breakdowns and Carrington rotation binning used to study variability and quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs) in flare types.

## Instrumentation Details

### X-ray Sensor (XRS) on board GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites)
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES X-ray Sensor data in the soft X-ray range (1–8 Å primarily, but also referencing 0.5–4 Å) form the foundation for the entire flare event analysis. These data provide temporal evolution (start, peak, end) for each event, from which rise time, decay time, and duration were derived. Data span portions of Solar Cycles 21, 22, 23, and 24, specifically from 1976 to 2016, with all major results based on direct event list and time-series analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) spacecraft in the 1 – 8 ˚A wavelength range for Solar Cycles 23, 24, and part of Cycles 21 and 22, we compare mean temporal parameters (rising, decay times, duration) and the proportion of impulsive short-duration events (SDE) and gradual long-duration events (LDE) among C- and ≥M1.0-class ﬂares."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Long- and mid-term flare analysis across solar cycles
- **Time Range**: 1976 – 2016 (covering portions of Solar Cycles 21, 22, 23, and 24)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The GOES spacecraft have provided continuous solar monitoring for more than 40 years, in particular, in the soft X-ray 0.5 – 4 ˚A and 1 – 8 ˚A wavelength ranges. These data are published by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) as the three-day plots and the ﬂare lists indicating their coordinates, class as well as the starting, maximum, and ending times.... This database has allowed us to analyze the temporal characteristics of the soft X-ray ﬂares of Cycles 21 – 24 in various combinations and representations."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1 – 8 Å (primary); also references 0.5 – 4 Å channel
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The GOES spacecraft have provided continuous solar monitoring for more than 40 years, in particular, in the soft X-ray 0.5 – 4 ˚A and 1 – 8 ˚A wavelength ranges."
- **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray flux from solar flares, with time-resolved measurements used to extract flare start time, maximum, end time, rise time, decay time, event duration, and flare classification (C1.0–C9.9, ≥M1.0, X-class)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In our analysis, we deal with just these temporal parameters which have been included in the IZMIRAN Database (Belov et al., 2005), in conjunction with many other solar and solar-terrestrial data. This database has allowed us to analyze the temporal characteristics of the soft X-ray ﬂares of Cycles 21 – 24 in various combinations and representations."
- **Additional Comments**: All temporal characteristics are based on the event definitions and timing criteria as specified in the NOAA user guide; flare lists and tabular event data are drawn from NOAA archives and the IZMIRAN Database.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "According to the NOAA user guide... the start of an X-ray ﬂare is deﬁned as the ﬁrst minute in a sequence of four minutes of steep monotonic increase in 1 – 8 ˚A ﬂux. The time of the ﬂare maximum is deﬁned as the minute of the peak one-minute averaged value X-ray ﬂux. The end time is the time when the ﬂux level decays to a point halfway (half peak) between the maximum ﬂux and the pre-ﬂare background level."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Detailed phase-specific and hemispheric analyses
- **Time Range**: Specific cycle phase ranges, e.g.:
    - Cycle 23: Ascending (1997–1999), Maximum (2000–2002.5), Declining (2002.6–2007)
    - Cycle 24: Ascending (2010–2011), Maximum (2012–2014.5), Declining (2014.6–2016)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For Cycles 23 and 24, respectively, the ascending phases covered during 1997 – 1999 and 2010 – 2011, the maximum phases included 2000 – 2002.5 and 2012 – 2014.5, and the declining phases covered 2002.6– 2007 and 2014.6– 2016."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1 – 8 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "the start of an X-ray ﬂare is deﬁned as the ﬁrst minute in a sequence of four minutes of steep monotonic increase in 1 – 8 ˚A ﬂux."
- **Physical Observable**: Distribution (fraction) of flare event types (SDE and LDE) by temporal parameters and flare class, including hemispheric occurrence
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In general, the data presented in Table 1 allow us to conclude that the relative number of the SDE ≥M1.0-class ﬂares in Cycle 24 exceeds that in Cycle 23 for all three temporal parameters during the maximum phase and for the decay parameter [dt2] during the ascending phase..."
- **Additional Comments**: Hemispheric assignment and statistics are directly analyzed from the event list data fields.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Now consider in Figure 5 the fraction of the SDE ≥M1.0- (a) and C-class (b) ﬂares with the duration dt <15 minutes occurred separately in the north (solid line) and south (dashed line) hemispheres."
