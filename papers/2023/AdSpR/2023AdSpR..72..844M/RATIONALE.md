produce the script. We need to construct queries that specifically target the observation of solar radio bursts using the CALLISTO spectrometer data from the Egypt-Alexandria station. Given the detailed context provided, we can focus on the specific time ranges and frequencies mentioned for the type II and type III radio bursts. Since the CALLISTO spectrometer is part of a global network, we will assume that the data can be accessed through a generic interface for solar radio observations, although specific access to CALLISTO data might not be directly available through SunPy's Fido. We will simulate the query process as if the data were accessible, focusing on the time and frequency ranges provided.
