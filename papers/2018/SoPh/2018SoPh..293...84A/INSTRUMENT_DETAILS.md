1. New-Tupi Cosmic Ray Detector  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - This ground‐based muon telescope is installed within the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region – specifically in Niterói, Brazil. It is designed to record the muon flux from three directions (vertical, east, and west) using coincidence detection between paired plastic scintillator detectors (150 × 75 × 5 cm³ each).
