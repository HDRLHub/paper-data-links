## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper presents a new reconstruction of total and spectral solar irradiance (TSI and SSI) covering 6000 BCE – 2015 CE using the CHRONOS model. The primary data sources directly analyzed in the research are satellite-era TSI composites (PMOD), sunspot number records (WDC-SILSO), magnetograms and continuum images from KP/512, KP/SPM, and SOHO/MDI, as well as solar modulation potential datasets derived from cosmogenic radionuclide measurements in ice cores. Solar UV spectral data from UARS/SUSIM and UARS/SOLSTICE are used to analyze SSI variability and validate model outputs. Observation periods explicitly include 1978–2015 (TSI composites, satellite UV), 1974–2010 (filling factor derivations), 1749–2016 (sunspot proxies), and long-term solar modulation potential reconstructions. The derived observations form the foundation for the irradiance reconstructions, model calibration, and direct verification of results.
