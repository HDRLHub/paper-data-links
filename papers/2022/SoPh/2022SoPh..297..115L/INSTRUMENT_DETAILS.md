## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of a moving Type IV radio burst observed on August 25, 2014, using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The research aims to provide insights into the emission mechanisms of Type IV radio bursts, which have been studied for over 50 years but remain not fully understood. The study combines LOFAR interferometric data with white light observations from SDO-AIA and SOHO/LASCO-C2 to track the propagation of the radio sources and understand their association with coronal structures. The paper also compares LOFAR data with Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH) imaging data and calculates the degree of circular polarization (DCP) at frequencies ranging from 20 to 180 MHz. The findings suggest that gyrosynchrotron emission is the most plausible mechanism for the Type IV burst, while coherent emissions like Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) instability may be responsible for small-scale fine structures.

## Instrumentation Details

### Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR)
- **General Comments**:
   - LOFAR is used to observe the moving Type IV radio burst with high resolution. It operates in the 10 MHz to 240 MHz frequency range and provides full Stokes parameters (I, Q, U, V).
- **Supporting Quote**: "We studied a moving type IV radio burst with fine structures (spike group) by using the high resolution capability of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) on Aug 25, 2014."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of the Type IV radio burst
- **Time Range**: August 25, 2014, 12:12 UT – 16:12 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On Aug 25, 2014, LOFAR had data from 12:12 UT until 16:12 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 10 MHz to 240 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LOFAR operates in the 10 MHz to 240 MHz frequency range with a frequency resolution of 12.5kHz."
- **Physical Observable**: Degree of circular polarization (DCP), brightness temperature (TB), and fine structures
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The degree of circular polarization (DCP) is calculated at frequencies in the range 20∼180 MHz using LOFAR data... The dynamic spectrum of LOFAR shows a large number of fine structures with duration of less than 1s and high brightness temperature (TB), i.e. 1012∼1013 K."
- **Additional Comments**: The study uses both Low Band Antenna (LBA) and High Band Antenna (HBA) for different frequency ranges.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Detailed analysis of fine structures
- **Time Range**: August 25, 2014, 15:20 UT – 15:21 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We plotted the TB profiles at 162 MHz and 122 MHz from 15:20 UT to 15:21 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 162 MHz and 122 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The intense bursts at 162 MHz reach about 6.5 × 1011 K, while the brightness temperature of the type IV background and the weaker fine structures fluctuates around 4 × 1011 K."
- **Physical Observable**: Brightness temperature (TB) of fine structures
   - **Supporting Quote**: "TB analysis showed that the most intense fine structures can exhibit a TB as high as 1013 K."
- **Additional Comments**: The fine structures observed include narrow-band drifting spikes and broadband pulses.

### Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - NRH is used for comparison with LOFAR data to validate the spatial resolution and positions of the radio sources.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We present a comparison of Nançay RadioHeliograph (NRH) and the first LOFAR imaging data of type IV radio burst."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Comparison with LOFAR data
- **Time Range**: August 25, 2014, until 15:23 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On Aug 25, 2014, LOFAR had data from 12:12 UT until 16:12 UT, while NRH observed the Sun until 15:23 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 150.9 MHz and 173 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For this event, LOFAR HBA has observations from 110 to 190 MHz. Two NRH frequency channels (150.9 MHz and 173 MHz), overlap with LOFAR observations."
- **Physical Observable**: Spatial resolution and positions of radio sources
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Both movie and images show that the positions of LOFAR and NRH radio sources are in agreement."
- **Additional Comments**: The comparison highlights the higher spatial resolution of LOFAR, which can resolve multiple separate sources that appear as a single source in NRH data.

### Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO-AIA)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO-AIA data is used to track the association of the Type IV radio burst with coronal structures.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We combined the LOFAR imaging data with SDO-AIA and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO)-C2 to track the type IV radio sources and understand their association with the ambient coronal structures."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Tracking coronal structures
- **Time Range**: August 25, 2014, 15:15 UT – 15:27 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At 15:15 UT, all radio sources appeared to be situated above the active region (NOAA AR 12146) that was the source of the associated CME/flare event... At 15:27 UT, radio sources at higher frequencies (170∼185 MHz) started to be observed again closer to the active region."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We plotted LOFAR 70% maximum contours of different frequencies on SDO-AIA 171 Å images."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal structures and their association with radio sources
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The combined LOFAR interferometric data with SDO-AIA 171 and LASCO-C2 indicate that this type IV is generated on expanding flare loops located in the CME core."
- **Additional Comments**: The study uses running differential images to track the propagation of the radio sources.

### Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO)-C2
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/LASCO-C2 data is used to observe the associated CME and its direction of propagation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We combined the LOFAR imaging data with SDO-AIA and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO)-C2 to track the type IV radio sources and understand their association with the ambient coronal structures."
