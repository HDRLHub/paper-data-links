## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the three-dimensional geometry, kinematics, and heliospheric impact of a large CME-driven shock associated with the 2017 September 10 eruption. Using multi-spacecraft remote-sensing and in situ observations, the authors track the CME and its shock separately—from their nascent stage near the Sun to their evolution in the outer corona and into interplanetary space. Key data include EUV and white-light images that capture the early expansion and propagation of the shock, as well as in situ solar wind measurements at the Earth and Mars that reveal shock arrival times and related plasma parameters. The timing of the observations is critical: images around 16:42 UT on September 10 capture the eruption while in situ signatures record the shock arrival at 19:21 UT on September 12 at the Earth (via Wind) and at 02:52 UT on September 13 at Mars (via MAVEN).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. GOES 16 on board NOAA’s GOES 16 Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES 16 provided early-stage EUV imaging of the eruption. The instrument captured the flux rope in high-temperature channels (e.g., 131 Å) and other running-difference images (e.g., 195 Å) that reveal both the flux rope and the associated wave (interpreted as the lower-atmosphere footprint of the CME-driven shock).

- **Additional Comments**:
   - These observations were critical for separating the flux rope and shock features near the Sun with minimized projection effects.

### 2. SOHO on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO provided white-light coronagraph images that capture the well-developed CME and its shock as a faint edge around the CME. This instrument is key for tracking the eruption from the inner to the outer corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Middle row: running-diﬀerence coronagraph image from SOHO (left) and corresponding modeling of the CME..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coronagraph Imaging of the CME and Shock
- **Time Range**: Approximately at the same time as the EUV observations from GOES 16; modeling in Figure 2 uses data at 16:42 UT on September 10, 2017.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "The 3D structures are taken from the modelings at 16:42 UT on September 10."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observations are performed in white light.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "running-diﬀerence coronagraph image..."
- **Physical Observable**: White-light brightness outlining the CME front and the faint shock edge.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "...the shock is also seen in the coronagraph images as a faint edge around the CME."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - This instrument’s viewpoint helps minimize projection effects and offers a clear image of the large and expanding shock structure.

### 3. STEREO A on board the STEREO A Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO A provided complementary white-light coronagraph imaging from a vantage point 128.1° east of the Earth. Its observations were used in concert with those from GOES 16 and SOHO to model the 3D structure of the CME and shock.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Bottom row: running-diﬀerence coronagraph image and modeling from STEREO A (128.1◦east of the Earth) near the same time."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Multi-Vantage Imaging of the CME and Shock
- **Time Range**: Approximately near 16:42 UT on September 10, 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "at the times given in Figure 1" and as part of the multi-spacecraft observations used for modeling.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light coronagraph imaging.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "running-diﬀerence coronagraph image..."
- **Physical Observable**: White-light features identifying the CME leading edge and the shock’s faint signature.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "the shock and the CME driver can be tracked separately from the early stage to the outer corona using the multi-point EUV and white-light observations."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The STEREO A observations are essential in providing side views that complement the Earth-based perspectives, thereby improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.

### 4. Wind (In Situ Measurements at the Earth)
- **General Comments**:
   - Wind’s in situ instruments measured key solar wind plasma parameters including proton density, bulk speed, temperature, and magnetic field strength at 1.01 AU. These data were used to identify the shock arrival and to compare with simulation outputs.

- **Time Range**: Shock arrival observed at approximately 19:21 UT on September 12, 2017.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "No ICME signatures were observed at the Earth, and only a forward shock arrived around 19:21 UT on September 12."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable for in situ plasma measurements.
- **Physical Observable**: Measurements of proton density, velocity, temperature, and magnetic field strength detailing the passage of the shock.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "In situ solar wind measurements ... from Wind."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The Earth-based in situ measurements provided critical validation for the multi-spacecraft remote-sensing observations and the modeled shock propagation.

### 5. MAVEN (In Situ Measurements at Mars)
- **General Comments**:
   - MAVEN provided in situ measurements of the solar wind parameters at Mars (1.66 AU). Its instruments recorded proton density, bulk speed, and electron differential flux, which were key to identifying the shock arrival at Mars.

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "electron diﬀerential ﬂux (descending from red to blue) at 20-210 keV from MAVEN."
- **Physical Observable**: Plasma parameters such as proton density and bulk speed along with energetic electron flux, which characterize the shock impact at Mars.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The MAVEN measurements helped demonstrate the shock’s broad longitudinal extent, given the near simultaneous arrival with Earth despite Mars being about 60° away from the CME/shock nose.

### 6. SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)
