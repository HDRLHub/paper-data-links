## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the dynamics of prominence tornadoes observed in solar prominences and their connection with the instabilities of the hosting prominences that can lead to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study utilizes data over the entire year of 2011, tracking individual tornado events from their formation until their disappearance. The primary observational data are obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) and are supplemented by coronagraph observations (LASCO/C2) for following the eruptive phases associated with CMEs. The analysis relies on high spatial and temporal resolution images in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral lines, and the work identifies different tornado categories (eruptive, active, and quasi-quiescent) based on their final behavior.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA provides high spatial and temporal resolution full-disk images of the Sun in several EUV channels. In this study, it is the primary instrument used for detecting and tracking prominence tornadoes over a full year (January 1 to December 31, 2011). The instrument’s observations across multiple EUV wavelengths (171 Å, 193 Å, and 304 Å) are essential for capturing the dynamic evolution and multi-thermal structure of the tornadoes and their associated prominences.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "In this paper, we analyze the data obtained by the SDO/AIA instrument during the whole year of 2011 to study the dynamics of all prominence tornadoes..."

#### Data Collection Period: Full Year 2011
- **Time Range**: January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The observations were obtained between 2011 January 1, and December 31 with the SDO."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å, 193 Å, and 304 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "AIA 171 ˚A images were used for this purpose as the prominence tornadoes are expected to be visible as dark structures in this line. After determining the final stages of evolution for individual tornadoes, we downloaded level 1 data and processed it to corresponding level 1.5 fits files of the 171, 193, and 304 ˚A band channels."
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - The dynamic evolution of prominence tornadoes including their appearance as dark structures (in the 171 Å channel) and associated brightening in the 304 Å channel upon activity, which are used as proxies for observing prominence instabilities and CME precursors.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Prominence tornadoes are usually seen in hot coronal lines (e.g. 171 ˚A) as thin dark vertical structures at the solar limb."  
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The cadence for the 171 Å images was set to 2 hours to monitor the long-lived nature of the tornadoes.
   - Data calibration and processing were performed using standard routines in the SolarSoft (SSW) package.

### 2. LASCO/C2 on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO/C2 coronagraph on SOHO is employed to identify and confirm CMEs that are associated with eruptive prominence tornadoes. It provides white-light imagery of the corona to detect the large-scale expulsions of plasma that follow the destabilization of the hosting prominence.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The LASCO CME catalog reports the first appearance of the CME in the field of view of the C2 coronagraph at 02:03:24 UT, October 13..."

#### Data Collection Period: Specific CME Observation Example
- **Time Range**: For the representative eruptive event:
   - **Eruptive Phase (onset and first appearance in LASCO/C2 field-of-view)**: Observations indicate:
      - Tornado eruption: approximately 01:00 UT, October 13, 2011
      - CME first appearance in LASCO/C2: 02:03:24 UT, October 13, 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Figure 3 shows the evolution and final eruption phase of an eruptive tornado in the 171 ˚A filter, ... the LASCO CME catalog reports the first appearance of the CME in the field of view of the C2 coronagraph at 02:03:24 UT, October 13..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - LASCO/C2 observes in white light (broadband visible continuum) to capture the electron-scattered light from the corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - (While the paper does not explicitly state the wavelength, it refers to the standard white-light coronagraph observations performed by LASCO/C2.)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The primary observable is the manifestation of CMEs as large-scale density structures in the corona, along with dynamics such as the mean speed (e.g., 216 km s⁻¹) and angular width of the CME.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "The CME appeared with an angular width of 125° in the northeast limb at a central position angle of 45° (see the lower right panel on Figure 3)."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 data is used in conjunction with the SDO/AIA observations to link the eruption of prominence tornadoes to the subsequent CME events observed in white light.
