### Explanation:
1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing necessary modules from `sunpy.net` and `astropy.units`. These libraries will help us construct and execute queries to the VSO.

2. **Defining the Time Range**: We specify the time range from 2010 to 2020, which aligns with the study period mentioned in the context.

3. **Setting the Wavelength**: The wavelength of interest is set to 171 Å, as this is the specific wavelength used in the study for both instruments.

4. **Constructing Queries**:
   - **SoHO/EIT**: We create a query for the SoHO/EIT instrument using the defined time range and wavelength. This instrument captures full-disc solar images crucial for the study.
   - **SDO/AIA**: Similarly, we construct a query for the SDO/AIA instrument. AIA's high-resolution images are essential for detailed studies and are used alongside EIT data for homogenization.

5. **Displaying Query Results**: The results of the queries are printed to verify the data that would be fetched. This step is crucial for ensuring that the queries are correctly set up before potentially downloading large datasets.

6. **Downloading Data**: The actual downloading of data is commented out to prevent accidental execution. These lines can be uncommented when the user is ready to download the data after confirming the query results.

This script directly addresses the need to fetch specific solar imaging data from the VSO for the purpose outlined in the context, adhering strictly to the specified requirements and data attributes.
