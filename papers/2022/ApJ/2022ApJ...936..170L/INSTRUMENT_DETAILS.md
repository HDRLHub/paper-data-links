## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the young K2 dwarf star ϵ Eridani (ϵ Eri) using archival far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (HST/COS). The study focuses on coronal dimming, a decrease in coronal emission indicative of CMEs, by analyzing Fe XII 1349 Å and Fe XXI 1354 Å emission lines. The research aims to constrain the mass of ejected plasma and the frequency of CMEs on ϵ Eri, comparing these findings to solar CMEs. The paper also discusses the implications of these findings for stellar and planetary evolution.

## Instrumentation Details

### Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
- **General Comments**:
   - The COS instrument on HST was used to observe the FUV emission lines of Fe XII and Fe XXI from ϵ Eri. These observations were crucial for detecting coronal dimming events and estimating the mass of ejected plasma.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We present the results of a coronal dimming analysis of Fe XII 1349 Å and Fe XXI 1354 Å emission from ϵ Eri, a young K2 dwarf, with archival far-ultraviolet observations by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph."

#### Data Collection Period 1: February 2015 Observations
- **Time Range**: February 2, 2015, 08:18:30 UT – 14:32:00 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We retrieved data from three separate HST visits of ϵ Eri that took place in February 2015, March 2017, and August 2017. The February 2015 visit was part of the MUSCLES Treasury Survey, program 13650 (France et al. 2016, PI Kevin France)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe XII 1349 Å, Fe XXI 1354 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We present the results of a coronal dimming analysis of Fe XII 1349 Å and Fe XXI 1354 Å emission from ϵ Eri, a young K2 dwarf, with archival far-ultraviolet observations by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal dimming, indicative of CMEs
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A signal diagnostic of CMEs on the Sun is coronal dimming: a drop in coronal emission, tied to the mass of the CME, that is the direct result of removing emitting plasma from the corona."
- **Additional Comments**: The February 2015 observations were part of the MUSCLES Treasury Survey and included multiple exposures to capture the variability in FUV emission lines.

#### Data Collection Period 2: March 2017 Observations
- **Time Range**: March 7, 2017, 06:33:08 UT – 11:12:00 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The 2017 visits, programs 14909 (PI Thomas Ake) and 15365 (PI Rachel Plesha) were conducted for instrument calibration, specifically to obtain dispersion solutions using the high SNR emission lines from ϵ Eri."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe XII 1349 Å, Fe XXI 1354 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We present the results of a coronal dimming analysis of Fe XII 1349 Å and Fe XXI 1354 Å emission from ϵ Eri, a young K2 dwarf, with archival far-ultraviolet observations by the Hubble Space Telescope’s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph."
