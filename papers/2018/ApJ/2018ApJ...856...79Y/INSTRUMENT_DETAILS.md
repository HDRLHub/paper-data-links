## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study presents a detailed investigation into two successive X-class solar flares (X2.2 and X9.3) and their associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in active region NOAA 12673, focusing on the roles of sunspot rotation and shearing motion from 2017 September 5 to September 6. The primary data are sourced from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), specifically the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), as well as ground-based images from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). Data from AIA in multiple EUV wavelengths (304 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å) are analyzed to trace the eruption processes, while HMI provides vector magnetograms, continuum intensity images, and line-of-sight magnetograms to track sunspot evolution, extract velocity fields, and conduct nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations. Additionally, LASCO C2 coronagraph data are used to characterize associated CMEs. The time period of direct observation and analysis is 2017 September 5–6, centering on the active region's emergence, sunspot dynamics, eruptive flares, and resulting CMEs.

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Figure 4 shows the eruptive process of the X2.2 flare in 304 A, 171 A, and 131 A images from the left column to the right one. All the images were overlaid by the contours of the line of sight magnetograms."
- **Additional Comments**: Observations directly analyzed to correlate sigmoidal filament eruptions and flare timing, as well as to track pre- and post-flare configurations.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Provided vector magnetograms, full-disk continuum intensity images, and line-of-sight magnetograms. Data were used for tracking sunspot evolution, magnetic structure, and calculating photospheric velocity fields and magnetic helicity.

  "The HMI can provide full disk continuum intensity image and line-of-sight magnetograms at 45 s cadence with a precision of 10 G. The continuum intensity images and line-of-sight magnetograms obtained by SDO/HMI are used to show the evolution of sunspots in active region NOAA 12673 from 2017 September 5 to September 6."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Sunspot and magnetic evolution before, during, and after X-class flares

These magnetograms from Space Weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) series have a pixel scale of about 0.5" and a cadence of 12 minutes."
- **Additional Comments**: Data were used as input to NLFFF extrapolation and for calculation of photospheric flows using DAVE.
