## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The study investigates unusual plasma and energetic particle signatures at Mars and STEREO-A that are associated with the interaction of multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It combines remote‐sensing observations and in situ measurements using several instruments (both imaging and plasma/magnetic field detectors) to trace the CME evolution from the low corona into interplanetary space and to link these signatures to a multi–step Forbush decrease (FD) observed at Mars. Observations span from the early onset of filament/prominence eruptions in the low corona (around 22:30 UT on July 22, 2017) and CME detections in coronagraph fields-of-view on July 23, 2017, to the in situ measurements of plasma, magnetic fields, and cosmic‐ray intensities recorded at STEREO-A and Mars from July 24 up to August 7, 2017.

### 4. STEREO-A/SECCHI – EUVI (Extreme Ultraviolet Imager)
- **General Comments**:  
  The EUVI instrument on board STEREO-A provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images in specific wavelength bands, capturing low–coronal dynamics such as prominence eruptions, dimming, and post–flare loops associated with CME onset.
