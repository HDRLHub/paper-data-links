# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the initiation mechanism of the first on-disk X-class eruptive flare in solar cycle 25. The study focuses on coronal magnetic field reconstructions to reveal a magnetic flux rope (MFR) and its role in the flare. The research utilizes data from various instruments, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), to analyze the evolution of the filament height and the current density. The findings suggest that the eruption follows a reconnection-based initiation mechanism, driven by the formation of a vertical current sheet due to continuous shearing motion along the polarity inversion line (PIL).

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA provides high-resolution images in multiple wavelengths, covering a wide range of temperatures from 10^5 K to 10^7 K. It is used to observe the filament motion and the flare ribbons during the eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the filament motion before and during the eruption
- **Time Range**: 2021-10-28 15:12 UT – 2021-10-28 15:32 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (and its supplementary animation) presents the SDO and STEREO-A observations of the flare eruption in different EUV channels... The first row display a clear J-shaped filament which remains stable before the flare onset. The second row show that the filament starts to rise up quickly. The third row present the eruption of the filament and the flare ribbons."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (c)-(f) Observations of the filament motion during the eruption from SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI with wavelengths of 304 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å, and 195 Å, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Filament motion, flare ribbons
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The first row display a clear J-shaped filament which remains stable before the flare onset. The second row show that the filament starts to rise up quickly. The third row present the eruption of the filament and the flare ribbons."
- **Additional Comments**: The AIA data is crucial for tracking the filament's rise and the development of the flare ribbons.

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The HMI provides vector magnetograms, which are used for extrapolating the coronal magnetic field and analyzing the magnetic flux rope (MFR) and current density evolution.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Extrapolation of coronal magnetic fields and analysis of current density
- **Time Range**: 2021-10-28 13:00 UT – 2021-10-28 15:12 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To confirm the pre-existence of the MFR, we extrapolate the pre-flare coronal magnetic fields of a time series from 13:00 UT to 15:12 UT with time cadence of 12 minutes."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms)
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic flux rope (MFR), current density
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The evolution of the current density in the extrapolated magnetic fields shows progressive thinning of a vertical current layer on top of the flare PIL, which hints that a vertical current sheet may form before the eruption."
- **Additional Comments**: The HMI data is essential for understanding the magnetic field configuration and the formation of the current sheet.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A)
- **General Comments**:
   - The EUVI provides images in the extreme ultraviolet range, which are used in conjunction with AIA data to triangulate the height of the filament.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Triangulation of filament height
- **Time Range**: 2021-10-28 15:22:30 UT – 2021-10-28 15:32:30 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In addition, the EUVI images from STEREO-A is used to determine the height of the filament around the eruption onset time by triangulation with the AIA images."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 (c)-(f) Observations of the filament motion during the eruption from SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI with wavelengths of 304 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å, and 195 Å, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Filament height
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To determine more precisely the height of the filament around the eruption onset time, we use a triangulation approach by combining the AIA and EUVI images."
- **Additional Comments**: The triangulation method provides accurate measurements of the filament height, which is critical for analyzing the eruption dynamics.

### Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Hα Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - The GONG Hα telescope provides Hα images, which are used to observe the filament before the eruption.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the filament
- **Time Range**: 2021-10-28 15:10 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 2(a) and (b) respectively show observations by SDO/AIA 304 Å and Hα from Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα (6563 Å)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Hα data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) are also used to show the filament with a spatial resolution of 1 arcsec."
- **Physical Observable**: Filament structure
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Since the filament can be observed all the time before its eruption without much variation from the start of October 28, here we only display the time (15:12 UT for AIA 304 Å and 15:10 UT for Hα) when the filament can be seen most clearly."
- **Additional Comments**: The Hα observations provide a clear view of the filament's structure before the eruption.
