## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the solar eruptive event SOL2001-12-26, which produced an M7.1 flare, a fast CME (speed 1446 km s⁻¹), and resulted in a significant solar energetic particle (SEP) event, including ground-level enhancement (GLE63). The study’s research objectives focus on understanding the origins and evolution of the CME, associated shock waves, and the mechanisms leading to high-energy particle acceleration. The analysis draws on multiple direct solar observations from both space- and ground-based instruments, utilizing multi-wavelength imaging and dynamic radio spectra. The specific periods of data usage center on the time of the eruptive event (2001-12-26), covering the eruptive phase, CME evolution, radio burst phenomena, and SEP monitoring, with attention to the temporal context of particle release and shock wave formation. The data form the foundation for reconstructing CME and shock kinematics, particle release times, and evaluating flare/shock acceleration contributions.
