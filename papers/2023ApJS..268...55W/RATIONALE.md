produce the script. We need to construct queries for the SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI instruments focusing on their use in detecting and analyzing solar active regions (ARs). Given the context, the primary attributes we need to include in our queries are the time range and the instrument, specifically targeting the observation of solar magnetic fields. We will ensure that the queries reflect the specific time periods mentioned for each instrument and use the VSO interface details to accurately specify the instruments and their capabilities.
