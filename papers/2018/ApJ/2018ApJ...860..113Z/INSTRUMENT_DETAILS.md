## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the vertical oscillation of a coronal cavity associated with a prominence observed on 2011 March 16. The research utilizes multiwavelength imaging and photometric data from instruments on board SDO (AIA, HMI, EVE), SOHO (LASCO), STEREO (COR1, EUVI), GONG (Hα), RHESSI, and GOES to study the oscillation event, its triggering by an EUV wave, and subsequent analysis for magnetic field estimation. All observation periods, wavelengths, and detailed event times are clearly integrated into the analysis for derivation of the paper's results.
