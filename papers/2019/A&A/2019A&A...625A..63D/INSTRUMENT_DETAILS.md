## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comparative analysis of solar radio bursts – the usual type III bursts observed in non-disturbed solar atmosphere and the narrow-band type-III-like bursts observed during Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) propagation. The study is based on radio dynamic spectra recorded over a specific day (June 13, 2014) and is complemented by optical observations of CMEs. The authors focus on key burst parameters such as frequency drift rate, duration, and instantaneous frequency bandwidth (IFB), and they infer coronal plasma properties such as density scale heights and emission source sizes. The observations are divided into four consecutive time periods, with two epochs (periods 2 and 4) associated with CMEs as witnessed by type IV radio bursts and space-based optical instruments.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. URAN-2 Radio Telescope (Ukrainian Radio Interferometer of National Academy of Sciences–2)
- **General Comments**:
   - URAN-2 is a ground-based radio telescope located in Poltava, Ukraine. It comprises a phased array with an effective area of 28,000 m² and is formed by 512 broadband cross dipoles. The instrument operates in the decameter wavelength range, specifically detecting radio frequencies between 8 and 32 MHz. In this study, URAN-2 is used to capture the dynamic spectra of both the usual type III bursts and the narrow-band type-III-like bursts.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The type III and narrow-band type-III-like radio bursts discussed in this paper have been analyzed using data from the radio telescope URAN–2 (Poltava, Ukraine). This instrument represents the phased array of effective area 28000 m2 consisting of 512 broadband cross dipoles operating at frequencies of 8–32 MHz.”

### 2. The Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is a space-based optical coronagraph designed for observing the solar corona. In this study, LASCO data are used to determine the positions and time evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are then correlated with the radio bursts observed by URAN-2.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...in combination with the CMEs’ position and time evolution inferred from data from the space-based optical telescope The Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard of Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO); see Fig. 2.”

#### Data Collection Periods (CME-related Intervals)
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME 1 Detection**
   - **Time Range**: CME 1 with a start time of 07:36 UT (observed during period 2)
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “...the space-based optical telescopes such as the SOHO [...] detected two CMEs, namely CME 1 with start time 07:36 UT...”
- **Data Collection Period 2: CME 2 Detection**
   - **Time Range**: CME 2 with a start time of 08:24 UT (observed during period 2)

### 3. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is mentioned as one of the space-based optical observatories employed to detect CMEs. SDO works in concert with SOHO by providing additional optical observations of the solar atmosphere, although further technical details (such as specific wavelengths or detector specifications) and explicit time ranges are not elaborated in the paper.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “At the same time, a number of space-based optical telescopes such as the SOHO and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) detected two CMEs...” 
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified in the text.
