## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the damping of propagating kink (Alfvénic) waves in quiescent coronal loops and examines their frequency‐dependent damping behavior. The study utilizes spectroscopic and imaging data from multiple instruments to derive and fit a model for the spatial evolution of the Doppler velocity power spectra along wave paths, and it applies a novel maximum likelihood method to estimate the quality factor (ξ) of the wave damping. The CoMP data, with its high temporal cadence and spectroscopic capabilities, provides the primary observational input, while contextual imaging and magnetic field measurements from SOHO (via EIT and MDI) and historical reference data from TRACE are used to support the interpretation of loop geometry and wave propagation.

### 1. Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP)
- **General Comments**:
   - CoMP is a combination polarimeter and narrow-band tunable filter that measures the complete polarization state of the corona, particularly in the vicinity of Fe XIII coronal emission lines.
   - It is used to capture Doppler velocity images of the solar corona, allowing the investigation of propagating Alfvénic (kink) waves along coronal loops.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "The data were obtained using the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) (Tomczyk et al. 2007, 2008). CoMP is a combination polarimeter and narrow-band tunable ﬁlter that can measure the complete polarization state in the vicinity of the 10747 ˚A and 10798 ˚A Fe XIII coronal emission lines."  
- **Data Collection Details:**

   #### Data Collection Period 1: Spectroscopic Observations of Fe XIII
   - **Time Range**: 30 October 2005  
     - **Supporting Quote**: "The data were taken on 30 October 2005, with a temporal cadence of 29 s, and a pixel size of 4.′′5."
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 10747 Å (primary analysis line), and 10798 Å (also measurable)  
     - **Supporting Quote**: "We focus on the spectroscopic data from the 10747 ˚A Fe XIII line..."
   - **Physical Observable**: Doppler velocity of coronal plasma (tracing propagating kink waves) and polarization state of coronal emission.  
     - **Supporting Quote**: "The CoMP Doppler velocity image sequence shows coherent ﬂuctuations propagating through the corona, which are interpreted as propagating kink waves."
   - **Additional Comments**: Spatial resolution is limited by a pixel size of 4.5 arcsec. The instrument provides high-cadence spectroscopic datasets that are essential for tracking the evolution of wave power along coronal loop segments.

### 2. Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - TRACE was one of the first instruments to detect transverse wave modes in coronal loops by imaging standing kink waves that were excited after flare activity.
   - Its observations serve as a historical reference for the presence of kink waves in the corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "The ﬁrst detection of transverse wave modes occurred after the launch of the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE, see Handy et al. (1999)), observing the presence of standing kink waves that were excited sporadically in coronal loops after nearby ﬂaring activity."
- **Data Collection Details:**

   #### Data Collection Period 1: Early Observations of Coronal Loop Oscillations
   - **Time Range**: Not specified in the text  
     - **Supporting Quote**: The paper only references the instrument’s launch and its early detection of standing kink waves without providing explicit observation dates.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified  
     - **Supporting Quote**: The reference to TRACE is solely in the context of its ability to image coronal loops.
   - **Physical Observable**: Transverse (kink) oscillations in coronal loops following flare events.
   - **Additional Comments**: TRACE is cited for its historical role in discovering coronal loop oscillations; specific observational parameters are not detailed in the present study.

### 3. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO instruments are used to provide contextual imaging and magnetic field measurements, which support the extrapolation of coronal magnetic field lines and enhance the understanding of loop geometry.
   - Two distinct instruments aboard SOHO are referenced: the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI).
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "To provide context images and magnetic ﬁeld measurements, data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) will also be utilized. Data from the Extreme Imaging Telescope (EIT) (Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) provides a context to the loops observed using CoMP."  
   - "Line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument (Scherrer et al. 1995) provide information on the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld for potential ﬁeld extrapolations."

   #### 3.1. Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT)
   - **Time Range**: Not specified in the text  
     - **Supporting Quote**: The text does not provide an observation date for the EIT images; it only mentions that these images are used to supply context.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å passband  
     - **Supporting Quote**: "The background image in the left panel is obtained from EIT 195 ˚A passband."
   - **Physical Observable**: EUV intensity images that show the large-scale coronal structure and provide context for the observed coronal loops.
   - **Additional Comments**: EIT images are used solely as contextual aids to verify the morphology of the coronal loops alongside the CoMP observations.

   #### 3.2. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)
   - **Time Range**: Not specified in the text  
     - **Supporting Quote**: The paper does not specify observation dates for MDI data.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified  
     - **Supporting Quote**: MDI is mentioned as providing LOS magnetograms, and no specific wavelength is provided.
   - **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (line-of-sight measurements) used for generating potential field extrapolations and guiding the interpretation of coronal loop geometry.
   - **Additional Comments**: MDI data contribute to the determination of the magnetic field configuration in the region of the observed loops, complementing the wave analysis provided by CoMP.
