## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper presents an analysis of the SOL2001-12-26 solar eruptive event responsible for GLE63. The primary research objectives are to understand the properties and causes of the event's unusual characteristics by examining the multi-loop structure of microwave and ultraviolet (UV) sources during the flare. The core analysis is based on direct observational data from the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 and 34 GHz (microwave images), the Siberian Solar Radio Telescope (SSRT) at 5.7 GHz (microwave images), and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) at 1600 Å (ultraviolet images). The study investigates data collected during the first and main flare phases, specifically from 26 December 2001, 04:23 to 05:22 UT, focusing on the evolution and morphology of the emissions and their association with magnetic structures. Other instruments (e.g., NoRP, Learmonth, SOHO/MDI, GOES, LASCO) provide supporting context and data for event timing, calibration, spectral, and magnetic analysis directly contributing to the paper's findings.

This burst could only be caused by expanding ejecta or a wave, which started well before the fast CME from AR 9742."
