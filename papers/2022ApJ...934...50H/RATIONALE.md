produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Wind and Venus Express (VEX) spacecraft observations related to the magnetic cloud (MC) event described in the paper. The queries will focus on the specific time ranges when the MC was observed by each spacecraft. Since the observations involve magnetic field and plasma parameters, and not electromagnetic wavelengths, the queries will be based on the time range and the instruments involved without specifying wavelengths.
