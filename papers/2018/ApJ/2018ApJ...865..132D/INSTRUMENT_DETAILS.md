## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents estimates for the EUV signal expected from the outer solar corona, focusing specifically on the observational and modeling results relevant to the proposed COSIE-C (COronal Spectrographic Imager in the EUV, Coronagraphic mode) instrument. The research is underpinned by direct analysis of data from two primary instruments: the SOHO/UVCS (UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer) and Hinode/EIS (EUV Imaging Spectrometer). UVCS observational campaigns from May to August 1996 provide spectral line radiances up to 3.1 solar radii for both quiescent and active region streamers. A unique Hinode/EIS off-limb campaign from May 7–10, 2007, extends spectroscopic measurements up to 1.5 solar radii. Both datasets are critical for establishing electron densities, temperature profiles, and elemental abundances, which are then used to model and predict COSIE-C’s potential performance and scientific yield in various solar environments (quiet Sun, streamers, active regions). The paper also features calibration details, specific wavelength ranges, and detailed analyses of physical observables such as line radiance, density, and temperature, with discussion on instrumental characteristics, data acquisition periods, and event context.

### UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - UVCS on SOHO provided the critical data for measuring spectral line radiances (e.g. Si XII, Mg X, H I Lyman β) from the outer corona, in both quiescent and active region streamers, covering radial positions from 1.4 up to 3.1 solar radii. Observations span May to August 1996, with direct analysis and data calibration performed by the authors.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "We have therefore searched the entire UVCS database of the ﬁrst year of operation, to try and ﬁnd observations of quiescent streamers with slit positions up to 3 R⊙ and exposures long enough so we could measure the radiances of the coronal lines. We have visually inspected dozens of observations and at the end only found a few useful datasets. Figure 2 shows the streamers we selected for further analysis. One was a quiet streamer observed on 1996 May 27... We have analyzed the observations on August 19th and 21st of the same streamer, to see if there were signiﬁcant changes. We found very little difference in the radiances, conﬁrming the impression from the LASCO/C2 images of a stable streamer."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Quiescent and active region streamers during 1996 minimum

- **Time Range**: 1996-05-27, 1996-06-01, 1996-07-22, 1996-08-19, and 1996-08-21
  - **Supporting Quote**: "One was a quiet streamer observed on 1996 May 27. During the following 28-day solar rotations, on June 24, July 22, and August 19, the streamer became increasingly active, because of the emergence of the large active region connected to the Elephant’s trunk which we have mentioned. On the other hand, on the opposite side of the Sun, the other (west) streamer was very quiescent for at least several days, around August 19. ... We have analyzed the observations on August 19th and 21st of the same streamer, to see if there were signiﬁcant changes."
- **Wavelength(s)**: O VI doublet, H I 1025 Å, Si XII 521 Å (second order), Mg X 610 Å (second order)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We have considered the O VI primary channel, where the O VI doublet, the H I 1025 ˚A and the Si XII 521 ˚A (in second order) lines are present. We have also analyzed the redundant O VI channel, where the Mg X 610 ˚A line is present in second order, next to the hydrogen Ly α."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal line radiance (e.g. Si XII 521 Å, Mg X 610 Å, H I Lyman β 1025 Å), streamer density and temperature profiles, elemental abundances, and their radial dependence from 1.4 to 3.1 solar radii.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The measured radiances are shown in Figures 3,4. The differences between the radiances of the west streamer, observed on the 19th and 21st, are small. What is remarkable is the agreement in the radiances of the east streamer, indicating very little differences between the two streamers during this quiet period."
- **Additional Comments**: Used fully calibrated UVCS data (version 5.2), with careful background subtraction, averaging to improve signal-to-noise; explicit use of both first and second order line sensitivities and relevant calibration scaling factors.

### EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode

- **General Comments**:
  - Hinode/EIS off-limb spectroscopic observations are directly analyzed to provide coronal line radiances, density, and temperature diagnostics up to 1.5 solar radii during a quiet Sun period in May 2007. EIS spectra are used to benchmark ionization temperatures and validate models for the outer corona.

- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "One of us (GDZ) designed an engineering EIS ’study’ to extract spectra from the bottom half of the long EIS slit, to reach greater distances. A week-long campaign (Hinode HOP 7) was coordinated to obtain simultaneous SOHO/Hinode/TRACE/STEREO observations during the SOHO-Ulysses quadrature in May 2007. EIS observations were obtained during May 7–10, as outlined in Del Zanna et al. (2009)... We have selected the observation which started on that day at 10:21 UT."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Off-limb quiet Sun observation up to 1.5 solar radii during May 2007

- **Time Range**: 2007-05-10 (observation started at 10:21 UT)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We have selected the observation which started on that day at 10:21 UT. The EIS 2′′ slit was moved with 8′′ jumps, to cover about 500′′ in the E-W direction. A long exposure of 60s was chosen. As far as we are aware, this is the only EIS observation of the quiet Sun up to such large distances."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe XI 188.2 Å, Fe XII 192.4 Å, Fe XII 195.1 Å, Fe XIII 202.0 Å, Fe X 184.5 Å, He II 256 Å (deblended)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Only a few of the strongest EIS lines had good signal at 1.5 R⊙: Fe XI 188.2 Å (a self-blend), the Fe XII 192.4 Å and 195.1 Å (a self-blend), and the Fe XIII 202.0 Å. The Fe X 184.5 Å line was barely visible. Figure 10 shows averaged spectra at the larger distance, 1.5 R⊙."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal emission line radiances, electron densities, and ionization temperatures up to 1.5 R⊙; validation of nearly constant ionization temperatures with radial distance.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Measuring densities is very difﬁcult because of the low signal in the density-sensitive lines. We obtain relatively good agreement between two of the main density ratios available to EIS at 1–2 MK, from Fe XII and Si X (for a discussion of available ratios see Del Zanna (2012)) using the Del Zanna (2013a) radiometric calibration... The averaged electron densities of this region/streamer are slightly higher than those we assumed in our model, which explains some of the differences. Some further differences are probably related to the temperature of the plasma."
- **Additional Comments**: Data were processed using custom-written software and radiometrically calibrated using Del Zanna (2013a); measures were taken to ensure the coronal signal was real and not due to stray light.
