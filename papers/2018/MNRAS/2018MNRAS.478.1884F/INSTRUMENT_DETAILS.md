## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study examines the statistical properties of the helium abundance (AHe) and the speed difference between helium ions and protons (vαp) in the solar wind originating from coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), and the quiet Sun (QS). Using in situ measurements of plasma parameters and magnetic field observations primarily from the WIND spacecraft over the period 2000–2008, the paper explores bimodal distributions in the space of AHe and vαp normalized by the local Alfvén speed (vA). The findings support the idea that both wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) and reconnection-loop-opening (RLO) mechanisms operate in parallel in all types of solar wind source regions, with differing contributions depending on the solar region and solar wind speed.
