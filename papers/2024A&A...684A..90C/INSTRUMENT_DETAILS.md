# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses a highly inclined coronal mass ejection (CME) that erupted from the Sun on March 13, 2012. This CME, characterized by a fast speed of approximately 2000 km/s and a wide angular extent of over 110Â°, was detected in situ two days later by spacecraft near Earth and STEREO-A. The study aims to understand the propagation and evolution of the CME and its interaction with surrounding coronal holes (CHs). The paper utilizes a variety of observational data from multiple spacecraft, including remote sensing from solar observatories and in situ measurements from spacecraft at different points in the heliosphere. The findings suggest that despite the large longitudinal separation and initial inclination of the CME, similar in situ signatures were observed at widely separated locations, indicating a possible deformation or rotation of the CME structure to cover a large longitudinal span over the ecliptic plane.

## Instrumentation Details

### Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provided crucial remote-sensing observations of the Sun, capturing the conditions around the coronal mass ejection and the associated solar flare.
