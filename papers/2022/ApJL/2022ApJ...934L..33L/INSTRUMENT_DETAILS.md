## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the rapid increase of horizontal magnetic field (Bh) around the flaring polarity inversion line during major solar flares. This phenomenon is analyzed using high-cadence vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The study includes 35 major flares, both confined and eruptive, and examines the correlation between Bh-increase and flare ribbons. The results suggest that the Bh-increase is driven by the reconnection-driven contraction of flare loops, providing statistical evidence for this mechanism.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is used to measure the Stokes parameters at six wavelengths along the Fe I 6173 Å absorption line. The data is used to derive the photospheric vector magnetic field using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm.
- **Supporting Quote**: "HMI measures the Stokes parameters at six wavelengths along Fe I 6173 Å absorption line, based on which the photopsheric vector magnetic field is derived by the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm (Hoeksema et al. 2014)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of major flares
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated, but the data includes flares from various dates.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We select 35 major flares (all larger than M6.0-class, see Table 1), including 9 confined and 26 eruptive cases, from the first release of high-cadence data (Sun et al. 2017)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 6173 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HMI measures the Stokes parameters at six wavelengths along Fe I 6173 Å absorption line..."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric vector magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...based on which the photopsheric vector magnetic field is derived by the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm (Hoeksema et al. 2014)."
- **Additional Comments**: The data has a plate scale of 0.5 arcseconds, with a cadence of 720 seconds for the regular product, and of 90 seconds or 135 seconds for the high-cadence product.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides images used to analyze the flare ribbons properties. The data is used to create spatio-temporal masks for flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We check the flares’ CME association through inspecting the SOHO LASCO CME catalog, and analyze the flare ribbons properties using the 1600 Å images provided by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of flare ribbons
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated, but the data includes flares from various dates.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We check the flares’ CME association through inspecting the SOHO LASCO CME catalog, and analyze the flare ribbons properties using the 1600 Å images provided by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "...analyze the flare ribbons properties using the 1600 Å images provided by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard SDO."
- **Physical Observable**: Flare ribbons

- **Additional Comments**: The data has a plate scale of 0.6 arcseconds and a cadence of 24 seconds. Saturation in AIA images during major flares is corrected by linear interpolation.
