## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study examines the evolution of coronal holes and the associated open magnetic flux over nearly two solar cycles (1996–2014), spanning solar cycles 23 and 24. The research relies directly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data from SOHO/EIT, SDO/AIA, and STEREO/EUVI A/B to automatically detect and characterize coronal holes on the full solar disk. Magnetograms from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI provide the photospheric magnetic context for flux quantification within detected coronal hole boundaries. The full analysis covers data from 31 May 1996 to 19 August 2014, with distinct periods corresponding to the operational lifetimes and complementary coverage of the respective spacecraft and instruments. Observation focuses include daily or sub-daily spatially resolved imaging and magnetic field measurement, enabling the study of latitudinal and temporal variation in coronal holes and their magnetic properties on the Sun.
  
## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - EIT is used for full-disk EUV imaging in the 195 Å channel, providing daily observations from 1996 to the end of 2010. These images serve as the basis for detecting coronal hole boundaries and subsequent measurement of coronal hole area and enclosed magnetic flux during solar cycle 23 and the early part of cycle 24.
- **Supporting Quote**: "EIT (Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995), an instrument onboard SOHO, has provided fourteen years of nearly continuous EUV observations over the span of solar cycle 23."

  - **Supporting Quote**: "For our SOHO-era (solar activity Cycle 23) data, this process is repeated for each time-step, with half of the solar surface not visible. Full rotation maps are built by summing these individual EIT hole maps over each Carrington rotation, and then flattening into a boolean map."

### Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO A/B
- **General Comments**:
  - EUVI instruments on STEREO A and B provide EUV imaging—particularly in the 195 Å channel—from unique off-Sun-Earth line positions.
