produce the script. We need to construct queries for the STEREO HI1 instruments on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B spacecraft, as well as for the SOHO LASCO C2 and C3 instruments. The queries will focus on the specific time ranges and wavelengths mentioned in the context, which are crucial for observing the sodium D line emission from the asteroid Phaethon.

1. **Identify the Instruments and Time Ranges**:
   - For STEREO HI1 (both A and B), we need to cover multiple periods from 1997 to 2022. Since the exact dates vary by apparition, we will assume a broad range for the query.
   - For SOHO LASCO C2 and C3, the specific period mentioned is from May 13–17, 2022.

2. **Set Up Wavelengths**:
   - STEREO HI1: 615–740 nm, focusing on the sodium D lines.
   - SOHO LASCO C2 and C3: Use the specific filters mentioned (Orange, Clear, and Blue).

3. **Construct the Queries**:
   - Use the `Fido.search` function from SunPy, specifying the time range, instrument, and wavelength for each query.

4. **Output the Query Results**:
   - Print the results of each query and provide commented out lines for data fetching, adhering to the directive not to execute data download commands.
