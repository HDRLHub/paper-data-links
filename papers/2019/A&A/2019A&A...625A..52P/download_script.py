This script uses SunPy's VSO interface to search for SOHO/SUMER spectral data that were used in the study.
Two separate queries are constructed:
1. A query for the first prominence (PRM1) observed on 8 October 1999.
2. A query for the second prominence (PRM04) observed on 7 June 2004.

Both queries use the SOHO/SUMER instrument since the available VSO interface for SUMER
covers the time range 1996/01/22 to 2017/04/04. The queries are explicitly built using only the required
values: time range and instrument information.
