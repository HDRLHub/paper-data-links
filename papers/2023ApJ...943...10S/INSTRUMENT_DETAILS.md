## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the probability distributions of sunspot area and magnetic flux using historical data from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and USAF/NOAA. The study spans from 1874 to 2020, covering 2995 sunspot regions with areas greater than or equal to 500 millionths of a solar hemisphere (MSH). The analysis involves fitting the data to various statistical models including power-law, tapered power-law, gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions. The study finds that the tapered power-law and gamma distributions are preferred based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The paper also estimates the distributions of the Sun-as-a-star total sunspot areas and discusses the implications for understanding large sunspots on other Sun-like stars.

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the SOHO spacecraft was used to investigate the emergence rates of small-scale bipolar magnetic field patches, contributing to the understanding of magnetic flux distributions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of small-scale magnetic field emergence rates
- **Time Range**: 1996 â€“ 2001
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Hagenaar et al. (2003) investigated the emergence rates of ephemeral regions (small-scale bipolar magnetic field patches) using the data from the Michelson Doppler Imager onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI; Scherrer et al. 1995) taken between 1996 and 2001."

- **Additional Comments**: The study by Hagenaar et al. (2003) contributed to understanding the distribution of magnetic flux in magnetic structures, including sunspots.

### Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on the Hinode satellite was utilized to analyze the emergence rates of small-scale magnetic field patches, extending the understanding of magnetic flux distributions up to active-region scales.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of small-scale magnetic field emergence rates extending to active-region scales
- **Time Range**: Data collection dates not specified, analysis published in 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Thornton & Parnell (2011) analyzed the emergence rates of small-scale magnetic field patches using the data from the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode satellite (Hinode/SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) and obtained a power-law formula extending all the way up to the active-region scales."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "Thornton & Parnell (2011) analyzed the emergence rates of small-scale magnetic field patches using the data from the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode satellite (Hinode/SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) and obtained a power-law formula extending all the way up to the active-region scales."
- **Additional Comments**: The findings from Thornton & Parnell (2011) suggest a continuous power-law distribution of magnetic flux emergence rates from small-scale patches to larger active regions.
