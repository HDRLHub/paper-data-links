## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper provides a comprehensive review of the field of helioseismology, which studies the Sun's internal structure and dynamics by observing surface oscillations. It highlights the progress made in understanding solar oscillations and internal processes, thanks to observational, theoretical, and modeling efforts. The paper discusses both global helioseismology, which focuses on global oscillation modes, and local helioseismology, which examines oscillation travel times and local frequency shifts to create 3D images of subsurface structures and flows. The paper also covers the historical development of helioseismology, key discoveries, and the impact of various instruments and missions, such as the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), on advancing the field.
