## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates a complex interaction between a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a high-speed solar wind stream (HSS) during a well‐observed event in June 2011. The paper integrates in situ measurements near 1 au with remote‐sensing observations and several modeling approaches to track the CME from its origin on the Sun (including its associated flare and coronal dimmings observed in EUV and soft X–rays) to its interaction with the ambient solar wind and eventual impact on Earth’s magnetosphere. Observations from multiple spacecraft—from ACE and WIND providing plasma, magnetic field and energetic electron measurements at 1 au; to STEREO’s SECCHI suite (including coronagraphs, heliospheric imagers, and EUV imagers) tracking the CME in the corona and heliosphere; and SDO (with AIA and HMI) and SOHO (with LASCO) used in reconstructing the CME’s structure and launch timing—enable a comprehensive view of the event’s evolution during key time intervals spanning from early June 21 UT in the low corona and up until in situ signatures on June 22–23, 2011.
