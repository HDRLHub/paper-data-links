## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the frequency-dependent damping of slow magnetoacoustic waves in the solar corona. These waves are observed in various coronal plasma structures and are used for seismological probing of coronal parameters. The study focuses on the phenomenon of wave-induced thermal misbalance and its impact on wave dynamics, proposing a new relationship between the damping time and oscillation period of standing slow waves. The research utilizes observational data from instruments like SOHO/SUMER, Yohkoh/BCS, Hinode/EIS, and SDO/AIA, particularly focusing on data from SOHO/SUMER at 6.3 MK.
