## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a systematic study of sunspot physical parameters – including magnetic tilt angles, areas, magnetic fluxes, and polarity pole separations – by analyzing full-disk magnetograms taken from space‐based instruments. The study covers sunspots from solar Cycles 23 and 24 (spanning from May 1996 to July 2018), with each sunspot group being measured at an average of about 66 epochs around meridian-crossing. Two complementary data sets are used: (1) magnetograms obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO); and (2) daily sunspot records provided by the USAF/NOAA Solar Region Summary. These instruments allow the authors to derive key observables such as the local magnetic flux densities (as recorded in the magnetograms) and the sunspot physical properties used to test solar magnetic field and dynamo theories.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument provides full-disk magnetograms used to measure sunspot magnetic properties, including flux, tilt angles, areas, and pole separations.
   - It was primarily used to capture data during Cycle 23.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “First, we use full disk magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) (Scherrer et al. 1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Cycle 23 Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Approximately May 1996 – (end of Cycle 23, roughly 2008)
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “The magnetic data span two decades from May 1996 to the present time covering two solar activity cycles (23 and 24)...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - [No explicit wavelength information is provided; the instrument is described solely as providing full-disk magnetograms.]
   - **Physical Observable**: Measurements of magnetic flux density which are used to derive sunspot magnetic flux, tilt angles, and related parameters.
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “[...using full disk magnetograms...] to characterize the sunspots, paying particular attention to the differences and similarities between ‘Hale’ and ‘anti-Hale’ spots.”
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The magnetograms have a pixel size of 2″×2″ and a cadence of 96 minutes. For consistency with HMI, the magnetic strengths from MDI are reduced by a factor of 1.4.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides high-cadence, full-disk magnetograms used in the study, especially for Cycle 24, ensuring continuity and consistency with the MDI data.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “...and HMI/SDO.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Cycle 24 Observations**
   - **Time Range**: From its operational start (post-launch, approximately 2010) up to at least July 2018
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “The magnetic data span two decades from May 1996 to the present time covering two solar activity cycles (23 and 24)...”  
         *(Note: While the full time span covers both cycles, HMI is the instrument operating during Cycle 24.)*
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - [No explicit wavelength details provided; the instrument is described as providing full-disk magnetograms similar to MDI.]
   - **Physical Observable**: The instrument records magnetic flux density used to determine sunspot magnetic flux, tilt angles, areas, and pole separations.
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “[Using] full disk magnetograms from ... HMI/SDO.”
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - Although HMI has a native cadence of 12 minutes, for consistency with the MDI data the study uses one HMI magnetogram every 96 minutes and bins the data to 1024×1024 pixels with the same 2″×2″ pixel size.

### 3. USAF/NOAA Solar Region Summary
- **General Comments**:
   - This dataset consists of daily sunspot records compiled by the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). It is used to identify and locate sunspots on each magnetogram, guiding the automated measurement processes.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “Second, we use sunspot records from the daily ‘USAF/NOAA Solar Region Summary’ composed by Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Concurrent with Magnetogram Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Covering the same overall period as the magnetogram data, from May 1996 to July 2018
      - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “The magnetic data span two decades from May 1996 to the present time covering two solar activity cycles (23 and 24)...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Physical Observable**: Provides information on sunspot group locations and areas which serve as an input for determining magnetic properties from the magnetograms.
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - This record is integral to the automatic identification and measurement of sunspot parameters, ensuring that magnetogram analysis is aligned with sunspot occurrences.

### 4. Huairou Solar Observatory (Referenced for Comparative Analysis)
- **General Comments**:
   - Although not used as a primary data source in this study, magnetograms from the Huairou Solar Observatory are mentioned in comparison, noting that an independent study utilizing these magnetograms produced similar results regarding sunspot tilt angle trends.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - “...an independent but smaller study of 203 active regions using magnetograms from Huairou Solar Observatory also found that the sunspot tilt angles decrease with increasing pole separation (Tian et al. 1999).”
- **Data Collection Period**:  
   - **Time Range**: Not specified in the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
- **Physical Observable**:  
   - Magnetograms used for the measurement of sunspot tilt angles.
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - This observatory’s data is mentioned solely for context and comparison with the results obtained from MDI and HMI datasets.
