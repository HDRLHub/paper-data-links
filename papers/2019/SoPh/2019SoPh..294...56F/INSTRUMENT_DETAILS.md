## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the kinematics and energetics of an EUV wave event that occurred on 11 April 2013 in association with an M6.5-class flare from NOAA AR 11719. The study uses multiwavelength observations to examine both fast- and slow-component EUV waves, analyzes the formation of stationary wave fronts at magnetic quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), and evaluates the energy transferred to an oscillating coronal loop. For these purposes, the authors employ data from several instruments covering EUV, UV, Hα, radio, and white-light coronagraph observations over various time intervals during the event. The instruments used include the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) in Hα, the Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS), and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO. In addition, the historical role of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO is mentioned regarding the discovery of EUV waves.
