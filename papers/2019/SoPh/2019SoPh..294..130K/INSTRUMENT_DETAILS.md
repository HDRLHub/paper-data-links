## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates which photospheric characteristics of solar active regions – in particular properties related to magnetic polarity inversion lines (MPILs) – are most relevant to the initiation and kinematic characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study combines information from several well‐established data sources and instruments. Active-region MPIL properties are computed from vector magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), while the kinematic properties of CMEs are derived from white‐light coronagraph observations provided by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard SOHO (using the CDAW catalogue). In addition, soft X‑ray flare information, as recorded by the GOES instruments, is used to classify flare intensities. For each eruptive event the study makes use of continuous observations (e.g. a 24‑hour window preceding each CME/flare) and tables listing event start and peak times (e.g. Table 1, with events spanning from 2011‑02‑15 to 2016‑04‑18).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI is used to obtain full-disk vector magnetograms of the solar photosphere, which are then deprojected and remapped into cylindrical equal-area (CEA) coordinates. These magnetograms provide maps of the magnetic-field vector components (Br, Bp, and Bt) and their associated uncertainties. The derived data (known as SHARPs) serve as the basis for calculating various MPIL-related parameters.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The properties related to MPILs were calculated from vector magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission (SDO: Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012). … these cut-outs contain, among others, maps of the magnetic‐field vector components of areas of interest, Br, Bp and Bt, and their corresponding errors…”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: 24-Hour Window Preceding Each CME-associated Flare
      - **Time Range**: For every event, the HMI vector magnetograms are continuously acquired over a 24‑hour period preceding the eruption.  
         - *Example*: For the X5.4 flare on 7 March 2012, observations span from “7 March 2012, 00:00 UT” (approximately) up to the flare peak at “7 March 2012, 00:02 UT” (as given in Table 1, with a cadence of 1 hour, though exact start and end times are determined relative to each event’s peak time).
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…we only study eruptions for which there exist observations for the entire day (24 hours) preceding them.”  
      - **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly stated in the paper; however, HMI typically observes the Fe I 6173 Å spectral line.
         - **Supporting Quote**: (Not provided explicitly in the text, so details are inferred from standard HMI operations.)
      - **Physical Observable**: Full-disk vector magnetic fields (Br, Bp, Bt) used to derive various MPIL-related properties.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…maps of the magnetic‐field vector components … are deprojected and remapped into cylindrical equal area (CEA) map coordinates …”
      - **Additional Comments**: The 24‑hour time series (with 1‑hour cadence) allows examination of the temporal evolution of non-potential magnetic properties in the active regions.

### 2. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is employed to observe CMEs in white light by capturing coronagraph images of the solar corona. The LASCO data (compiled in the CDAW catalogue) enable the derivation of CME kinematics such as the plane-of-sky speed, acceleration, estimated mass, and kinetic energy based on height–time measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO) Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) catalogue (Gopalswamy et al., 2009) was used to extract the kinematic characteristics of CMEs. Height–time measurements are fitted to produce the (plane-of-sky) CME speeds and accelerations…”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: CME Event Observations
      - **Time Range**: The LASCO observations cover the periods during which each CME is visible in the coronagraph field-of-view.  
         - *Example*: Table 1 lists CME-related times (e.g., for the event on 15 February 2011, the flare/CME peak time is “2011-02-15T01:44:00.000”, and similar timestamps are provided for events up to “2016-04-18T00:14:00.000”).  
         - **Supporting Quote**: “Table 1. Our eruptive ﬂare sample and supporting information…” (which includes specific event times and CME speeds).
      - **Wavelength(s)**: Observations are in white light.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…white‑light observations combined with several assumptions can lead to an estimation of the CME (representative) mass and kinetic energy.”
      - **Physical Observable**: CME kinematics (linear speed, acceleration) and estimated CME mass/kinetic energy are derived from the height–time analysis of CME fronts.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “Height–time measurements are ﬁtted to produce the (plane-of-sky) CME speeds and accelerations…”
      - **Additional Comments**: While the paper does not state a fixed “start–end” operating window for LASCO observations, it uses the event timestamps from a sample of CMEs observed between February 2011 and April 2016.

### 3. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) – Soft X-ray Imagers
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES instruments are responsible for monitoring and categorizing solar flares based on their soft X-ray emissions (typically in the 1–8 Å band). The flare intensities (classes X, M, C, etc.) reported in the study are derived from GOES measurements.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The intensity of ﬂares is categorized by their peak soft X-ray output at 1–8 ˚ A, in a logarithmic scale of classes (X, M, C, B, and A, in decreasing intensity)…”  
      - Additionally, Table 1 denotes “NOAA GOES” which assigns the flare class (e.g., X2.2, X1.1, etc.) to each event.
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: Flare Monitoring During Eruptive Events
      - **Time Range**: The GOES soft X-ray measurements cover the times of flare events as reported in Table 1.  
         - *Example*: For the event on 15 February 2011 at “2011-02-15T01:44:00.000” and other events spanning from February 2011 through April 2016.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…for each eruptive flare we calculate the corresponding ﬂare index …” (referring to the use of GOES soft X-ray measurements).
      - **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å soft X-ray band.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…peak soft X-ray output at 1–8 ˚ A…”
      - **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray flux from the Sun, used to classify flare intensities.
         - **Supporting Quote**: “…categorizes the intensity of ﬂares by their peak soft X-ray output…”
      - **Additional Comments**: GOES measurements provide the basis for the flare index, which is correlated with the various MPIL-related parameters derived from HMI data.
