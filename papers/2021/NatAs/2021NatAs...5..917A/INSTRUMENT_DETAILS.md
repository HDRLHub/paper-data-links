## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study reports on GRB 200826A – a burst detected with unusually short duration yet showing multiwavelength evidence for a collapsar (long GRB) origin. The work combines gamma‐ray detections, optical imaging/photometry, X‑ray monitoring, radio follow‐up, and spectroscopy of the host to constrain the burst energetics, afterglow evolution, and the appearance of an accompanying supernova. Observations were collected over a wide range of time scales, from sub‐second gamma‐ray prompt emission (lasting less than 1–2 s) to optical and radio follow‐up extending for weeks and even months after the burst.

Below is a detailed list of each instrument mentioned in the paper along with their associated observing periods, detector details, wavelengths, and physical observables when provided.
