## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study of two major solar eruptions that occurred on 2012 July 23 and 2017 July 23. The primary research objective is to understand how solar superstorms form, with special attention to the “perfect storm” scenario in which a combination of solar eruptions and interplanetary interactions generate extreme solar wind speeds and magnetic fields at 1 AU. The study employs multipoint remote-sensing and in situ observations from a network of spacecraft – including SOHO, STEREO (Ahead and Behind), MAVEN, and Wind – to capture both the evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) close to the Sun and their propagation in interplanetary space. Each instrument provided unique observational data such as EUV images, coronagraph observations, radio dynamic spectra, and plasma parameters, over well-defined time ranges during the events. These data sets are essential to confirm features such as preconditioning of the solar wind, multiple successive eruptions, shock propagation, and CME deflections by coronal holes.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO provides coronagraph imaging that captures the large-scale structure of CMEs. Its observations complement those from STEREO by offering a near-Earth viewpoint. In the 2017 July event, SOHO recorded a full-halo appearance of the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The event appears as a full halo in both SOHO and STEREO A, which indicates that a deflection may have occurred..." (Page 7)
- **Data Collection Period 1: 2017 July Event Imaging**
   - **Time Range**: 2017 July 23 (implied during the period of coronagraph observations; near the time when STEREO A COR2 images are recorded at about 05:09 UT)
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Note that the COR2 images from STEREO A provide a strong constraint on the fit. The observed CME is always much wider than the model for SOHO" (Page 7)
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly specified; however, SOHO typically observes in white light (visible continuum) coronagraph imagery.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (Implied within the context of multi-point coronagraph observations.)
   - **Physical Observable**: CME morphology and propagation; the full-halo appearance indicating Earth (or near-Earth) impact likelihood.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The event appears as a full halo in both SOHO and STEREO A" (Page 7)
   - **Additional Comments**: SOHO’s imaging was used in conjunction with STEREO data to model the CME and shock structure.

### 2. STEREO A – Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO A is a multi-instrument platform that provided both remote-sensing (EUV and coronagraph) observations and in situ measurements. It played a key role in imaging the source region, capturing EUV flaring, prominence eruptions, and coronagraph observations (using instruments such as EUVI, COR1, and COR2). In addition, STEREO A recorded the in situ passage of shocks and ICMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 2 displays the solar source and evolution of the complex CME observed from STEREO A." (Page 4)
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: 2012 July Event – Remote Sensing and In Situ
- **Time Range**: 2012 July 23 – from the eruption onset around 02:20 UT until the shock arrival at 20:55 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "During the time of the 2012 July 23 eruptions... The event started around 02:20 UT with two consecutive prominence eruptions... A forward shock passed STEREO A at 20:55 UT on July 23." (Pages 2–3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly mentioned for imaging on STEREO A in 2012; it is implied that coronagraph observations (white light) were used.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Context inferred from multi-point imaging observations.)
- **Physical Observable**: CME kinematics, shock propagation, and in situ plasma parameters (e.g., solar wind speed, magnetic field strength).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The peak speed behind the shock is 2246 km s−1, and the maximum magnetic field is 109 nT..." (Page 3)
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO A provided a near-Sun perspective from its position at 0.96 AU for the 2012 event.

#### Data Collection Period 2: 2017 July Event – EUV Imaging, Coronagraph Observations, and In Situ Measurements
- **Time Range for Remote Sensing**: 2017 July 23
   - **Specific Intervals**:
      - EUV Imaging: First eruption observed at around 03:26 UT (304 Å and 195 Å images) and the second eruption ~10 minutes later.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "The first one occurred around 03:26 UT, as can be seen from the flaring in 304 Å... About 10 minutes later, a prominence erupted..." (Page 4)
      - Coronagraph Observations: Twin-CME signatures seen in COR1 around 04:20 UT and features in COR2 at 05:09 UT.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "Twin-CME signatures are seen in COR1 around 04:20 UT... There is a structure in COR2 at 05:09 UT..." (Page 4)
- **Time Range for In Situ Measurements**: 2017 July 24
   - **Specific Time**: Shocks observed around 17:54 UT on July 24.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "A pair of shocks, which are step-like and only 9 minutes apart, are observed around 17:54 UT on July 24..." (Page 5)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - EUVI channels: 195 Å and 304 Å.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The EUV images present clear evidence of two successive eruptions. The first one occurred around 03:26 UT, as can be seen from the flaring in 304 Å and a subsequent coronal wave in 195 Å." (Page 4)
- **Physical Observable**:
   - EUV observations captured prominence eruptions, flaring, and coronal waves.
   - Coronagraph imagery provided details on CME morphology and shock formation.
   - In situ measurements recorded plasma parameters such as solar wind speed, magnetic field strength, and density.
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The solar wind measurements at STEREO A... show high magnetic field strengths with a sustained southward component and record shock speeds." (Pages 5–6)
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO A also provided a radio dynamic spectrum revealing type III and type II radio bursts during the complex eruption.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 7 shows the radio dynamic spectrum from STEREO A. Three consecutive type III radio bursts are observed on July 23..." (Page 9)

### 3. STEREO B – Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Behind
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO B contributed to the multi-point imaging observations during the 2012 July event. It captured the onset of the eruptions, particularly the twin prominence eruptions.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The event started around 02:20 UT with two consecutive prominence eruptions ... as can be seen in the observations of STEREO B." (Page 3)
- **Data Collection Period: 2012 July Event**
   - **Time Range**: 2012 July 23, beginning at the eruption onset around 02:20 UT (exact end time not explicitly given but contemporaneous with the overall event timeline).
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The event started around 02:20 UT with two consecutive prominence eruptions separated by about 10 - 15 minutes, as can be seen in the observations of STEREO B." (Page 3)
- **Wavelength(s)**: While not explicitly listed for STEREO B, it is implied that EUV imaging (304 Å and/or 195 Å) is used similarly to STEREO A.
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of prominence eruptions and early coronal activity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Context as provided in the description of the eruption onset in STEREO B observations.)
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO B’s in situ instruments or radio dynamic spectrum were not used for the later stages of the event; in addition, STEREO B lost contact by 2014 for the 2017 event.

### 4. MAVEN – Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN
- **General Comments**:
   - MAVEN provided in situ measurements in the Martian environment during the 2017 July event, offering a perspective far from 1 AU (at 1.64 AU). Its data include proton density, bulk speed, and electron differential flux, adding to the multi-point characterization of the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The MAVEN spacecraft around Mars, which was 178◦ east of the Earth and 1.64 AU from the Sun, provides another vantage point of in situ measurements." (Page 4)
- **Data Collection Period: 2017 July Event – In Situ Measurements at Mars**
   - **Time Range**:
      - Shock Detection: A forward shock arrived around 19:10 UT on July 25.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "A forward shock probably arrived at Mars around 19:10 UT on July 25, as can be identified from the peak in the high-energy particles." (Page 6)
      - Continued data indicating the leading edge of ICME2 was observed on July 28.
         - **Supporting Quote**: "There is a decrease in the electron flux on July 28, which may indicate the location of the leading edge of ICME2." (Page 6)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ detector measurements; electron and ion fluxes rather than imaging wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Proton density, bulk speed, and electron differential flux (energetic storm particles near the shock).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 6 gives the in situ measurements at Mars. From top to bottom, the panels show the proton density, bulk speed, and electron differential flux..." (Page 6)
- **Additional Comments**: MAVEN data, although lower in temporal resolution due to orbital averaging, corroborate the arrival and structure of the CME observed by other instruments.

### 5. Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind spacecraft was also used to inspect radio dynamic spectra and in situ solar wind measurements near the Earth during the event. However, in this study, Wind data did not reveal a clear type II burst or a shock arrival.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "We also look at data from Wind, but find no clear type II burst in the radio dynamic spectrum and no shock arrival in the solar wind measurements near the Earth." (Page 10)
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified; observations were concurrent with the 2017 event when Wind was monitoring the near-Earth solar wind.
      - **Supporting Quote**: (As noted above, referring to the period of the 2017 July event.)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; Wind instruments measure plasma and magnetic field parameters and provide radio dynamic spectra rather than imaging wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**: In situ plasma parameters and radio dynamic spectra (search for type II bursts).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "no clear type II burst in the radio dynamic spectrum and no shock arrival in the solar wind measurements near the Earth" (Page 10)
- **Additional Comments**: The absence of clear shock signatures in Wind data contrasts with the strong in situ measurements by STEREO A and MAVEN and underscores the multipoint nature of the study.
