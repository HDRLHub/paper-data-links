## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed analysis of multi-wavelength follow‐up observations of the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its active episode in early 2020. The study focuses on testing afterglow models for the low‐luminosity fast radio burst FRB 200428 by comparing early radio, optical, and high‐energy (X‐ray/gamma‐ray) observations. LOFAR imaging data, acquired during several epochs in April, May, and October 2020, provide the deepest low‐frequency radio limits and image‐plane searches for persistent and transient emission. In addition, several other instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. STARE‑2, CHIME/FRB for radio bursts; multiple X‑ray satellites including Integral, Insight‑HXMT, AGILE, Konus‑Wind; and optical facilities such as BOOTES‑3, BOOTES‑2, and LCOGT) detected either the burst or provided constraints on the afterglow. The paper also discusses the theoretical synchrotron maser shock model, outlining the expected evolution of the afterglow and stressing the importance of rapid multi-wavelength observations to discriminate between competing FRB progenitor models.
