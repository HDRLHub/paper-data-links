## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a comprehensive catalog of variable differential rotation measurements near the solar photosphere, utilizing several observational techniques including direct Doppler, granule tracking, magnetic pattern tracking, and both local and global helioseismology. The study highlights historical measurements of differential rotation, provides a detailed comparison of these measurements during the MDI-HMI-GONG-Mt. Wilson overlap period (April 2010 – Jan 2011), and investigates discrepancies between different measurement techniques. Additionally, the paper discusses torsional oscillation from Sunspot Cycles 23 and 24, examining properties consistent across different measurement techniques. The findings aim to enhance understanding of systematic effects associated with various flow measurement techniques and improve the determination of global patterns of solar flows.
