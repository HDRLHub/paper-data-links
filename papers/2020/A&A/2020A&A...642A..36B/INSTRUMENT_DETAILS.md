1. MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) on board SOHO  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - MDI is one of the key instruments cited for helioseismic observations. It is used to measure solar oscillations via Doppler shifts and provides essential p-mode frequency data that allow detailed inversion studies of the solar interior (e.g., sound speed, density, and the Ledoux discriminant).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “The frequency dataset considered is a combination of MDI and BiSON data from Basu et al. (2009) and Davies et al. (2014).”  
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Helioseismic Observations**  
     - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper; the dataset is noted to have been acquired over “decades” of observations.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “Thanks to the exquisite observational data taken over decades…”  
   - **Wavelength(s)**:  
     - Specific wavelengths are not provided in the text. However, as a Doppler-imaging instrument, MDI typically observes in spectral lines formed in the solar photosphere.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - (No explicit quote provided on wavelengths; deduced from typical instrument function.)  
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     - The instrument records solar oscillation frequencies (p-modes), which are used to deduce physical quantities such as the sound speed profile and the Ledoux discriminant through inversion techniques.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “...the frequency dataset considered is a combination of MDI and BiSON data...”  

2. BiSON (Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - BiSON is a ground-based network dedicated to observing solar oscillations, particularly low-degree p-modes. Its data are essential for helioseismic studies and are combined with MDI observations in the presented analysis.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “The frequency dataset considered is a combination of MDI and BiSON data from Basu et al. (2009) and Davies et al. (2014).”  
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Low-Degree p-mode Measurements**  
     - **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated; the observations are understood to span “decades” as part of the long-term helioseismic monitoring program.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - “...exquisite observational data taken over decades…”  
   - **Wavelength(s)**:  
     - Specific wavelength information is not mentioned in the paper. BiSON measures Doppler shifts in spectral lines typical of solar photospheric observations.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - (No explicit mention; details are inferred from the instrument’s standard operation.)  
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     - BiSON provides measurements of oscillation frequencies (especially low-degree modes) which are subsequently used to compute frequency-separation ratios, sound-speed inversions, and other helioseismic observables such as the Ledoux discriminant.

3. GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - GOLF is another helioseismic instrument used as an alternative data source in this study. It is utilized to test the sensitivity and robustness of the reconstruction procedure by comparing its results with those obtained from BiSON data for low-degree p-mode frequency measurements.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “Only slight changes in the period spacing values, of the order of 10 s, are found if the reconstruction procedure is carried out using GOLF data from Salabert et al. (2015) instead of BiSON data for the low degree modes.”  
   - **Data Collection Period 1: Low-Degree p-mode Observations (Alternate Dataset)**  
     - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided; the referenced GOLF data are from Salabert et al. (2015) but no specific observation dates or periods are mentioned in the text.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - (Time ranges are not specified beyond the publication reference to 2015.)  
   - **Wavelength(s)**:  
     - The specific wavelengths are not detailed in the paper. GOLF, typically, measures low-frequency Doppler shifts in integrated sunlight, often targeting spectral features in the solar disc that are sensitive to oscillations.  
       - **Supporting Quote**:  
         - (No explicit mention in the provided text.)  
   - **Physical Observable**:  
     - Like BiSON and MDI, GOLF records solar oscillation frequencies. It is used here to derive observables such as the asymptotic period spacing of g-modes (in an alternative test configuration) alongside p-mode frequency separations, which are crucial for the seismic inversion process.
