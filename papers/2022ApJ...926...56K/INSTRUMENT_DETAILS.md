## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a statistical analysis of magnetic fields within flare ribbons in the photosphere, using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The study focuses on comparing the magnetic properties of flaring and non-flaring regions within active regions (ARs), specifically analyzing magnetic flux, magnetic shear, vertical current, and net current. The research aims to understand the physical properties that guide solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), suggesting that while flares are influenced by extensive properties like total magnetic flux, CMEs are influenced by intensive properties like the fraction of AR magnetic flux involved. The findings are based on a new dataset, FlareMagDB, which includes vector magnetic field properties for 40 flaring events.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The HMI instrument is used to measure the vector magnetic fields in the photosphere. In this study, it provides crucial data for analyzing the magnetic properties of active regions before solar flares.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-flare magnetic field analysis
- **Time Range**: Data used from 2010 to 2015, specific times for each event are detailed in the FlareMagDB database.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified, but HMI observes the Fe I absorption line at 6173 Å.
- **Physical Observable**: Vector magnetic fields (Bx, By, Bz)
- **Additional Comments**: The study uses pre-flare vector magnetograms to calculate various magnetic field properties such as magnetic flux, shear, and currents within the AR, ribbon, and PIL areas.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides high-resolution imagery of the solar atmosphere in multiple wavelengths, which is crucial for identifying flare ribbons and understanding their relationship with magnetic field structures.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare ribbon identification
- **Time Range**: Data used from 2010 to 2015, specific times for each event are detailed in the FlareMagDB database.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1600 Å channel primarily used for identifying flare ribbons.
- **Physical Observable**: Ultraviolet emissions from flare ribbons
- **Additional Comments**: AIA 1600 Å images are used in conjunction with HMI data to identify the areas swept by flare ribbons and to coregister these areas with magnetic field maps for analysis.
