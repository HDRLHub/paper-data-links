# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

Below is a detailed, instrument‐by‐instrument breakdown of the in‐situ and remote‐sensing tools used in the study, the time intervals over which they recorded data for this event, and the main observables or measurement types that were leveraged to analyze the magnetic cloud and its evolution.

### 1. MESSENGER Magnetometer on board MESSENGER (Mercury)
- **General Comments**:
  - This instrument measured the interplanetary magnetic field in the vicinity of Mercury. Due to Mercury’s own intrinsic magnetic field and magnetospheric structures (bow shock, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere), care was taken to identify intervals when MESSENGER was immersed in the pure solar wind. In this study, the MESSENGER magnetometer data were used to capture the signature of the magnetic cloud (its enhanced field strength and smooth rotation of the field vector) as it passed near Mercury.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “…the magnetic cloud observed by the magnetometer onboard spacecraft MESSENGER …” (Section 2.1)
  
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Data Collection Interval**: Approximately February 15, 2014 starting near 20:20 UT through February 16, 2014 around 15:40 UT.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “The magnetic cloud can be recognized between February 15 20:20 UT and about 15:40 UT on the next day as indicated by the light‐shadowed region bounded by two vertical blue lines in Figure 1a.”  
- **Wavelength(s) / Detected Observable**:  
  - Measures magnetic field strength and vector components (without a characteristic wavelength since it is a fluxgate–type instrument rather than a photon detector).
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “Figure 1a shows the measurements of the magnetic field …”  
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Observations had to be carefully interpreted because parts of the data are affected by Mercury’s own magnetosphere and bow shock crossings.

### 2. VEX Magnetometer on board Venus Express (VEX)
- **General Comments**:
  - The Venus Express magnetometer provided magnetic field measurements near Venus. Although the spacecraft’s location sometimes placed it behind Venus’s induced magnetosphere or bow shock, a clear interval was identified where the solar wind and magnetic cloud signatures could be observed.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “The magnetic field data from the VEX magnetometer [Zhang et al., 2006] suggests that … the interval between February 17 22:40 UT and 18 13:00 UT is the only possible candidate …”  
  
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Data Collection Interval**: February 17, 2014 at about 22:40 UT through February 18, 2014 at about 13:00 UT.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “…the interval between February 17 22:40 UT and 18 13:00 UT is the only possible candidate…”  
- **Wavelength(s) / Detected Observable**:
  - Measures magnetic field vector components (similar to a fluxgate magnetometer); no optical wavelengths involved.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “…during which the long and smooth rotation of the magnetic field vector is evident.”
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Data coverage was intermittent due to the spacecraft occasionally being immersed in Venus’s induced magnetosphere rather than in the ambient solar wind.

### 3. WIND Instruments on board Wind (Earth)
- **General Comments**:
  - WIND provided comprehensive in-situ observations near Earth. Both magnetic field data (from its magnetometer) and solar wind plasma measurements (from the Solar Wind Experiment, SWE) were used. In addition, plasma parameters such as solar wind speed, temperature, proton density, and pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electrons were key to characterizing the magnetic cloud.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “Figure 2. Observations of the magnetic cloud recorded by the Wind spacecraft …” and “The shock arrived at Wind at 03:10 UT on February 19 …”  

#### Data Collection Period:
- **Data Collection Interval**:  
  - The magnetic cloud (labeled as ejecta ‘E2’) arrived at about 16:10 UT on February 18, 2014.
  - A following driven shock was recorded at Wind at about 03:10 UT on February 19, 2014, with part of the cloud’s data being subject to shock compression requiring recovery.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “Ejecta ‘E2’ arriving at about 16:10 UT on February 18 … the shock arrived at Wind at 03:10 UT on February 19 …”  
- **Wavelength(s) / Detected Observable**:
  - Magnetic field (vector magnitude, components, rotation, etc.)
  - Plasma parameters including solar wind velocity, proton density, and temperature.
  - Pitch-angle distribution of suprathermal electrons.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “...the total magnetic field strength, |B|, three components of B in GSE coordinates, the elevation, θ, and azimuthal, φ, angle of the B vector, the pitch angle (PA) distribution of suprathermal electrons, …”  
- **Additional Comments**:
  - In order to fit the magnetic cloud structure, a method to recover the shocked structure was employed due to the compression observed during a driven shock.

### 4. MSL/RAD (Radiation Assessment Detector) on board Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)
- **General Comments**:
  - The RAD instrument onboard MSL was used to monitor cosmic ray dose rates at Mars. Its sensitivity to Forbush decreases allowed the researchers to link decreases in cosmic ray intensity to the passage of the CME/magnetic cloud.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “The only useful data are from the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD, Hassler et al. 2012) onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL …”  
  
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Data Collection Interval**:  
  - Continuous observations from February 15, 2014 to March 5, 2014.
  - Notably, the predicted arrival time of the magnetic cloud at Mars is marked at about 17:30 UT on February 23, 2014.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “Figure 4 shows the dose rate of cosmic rays recorded by the RAD from February 15 to March 5 … The predicted arrival of the magnetic cloud perfectly corresponds to the beginning of a decrease … (vertical line).”
- **Wavelength(s) / Detected Observable**:
  - The instrument measures cosmic ray dose rates (in units of microGray per day); it is not associated with an optical wavelength but with energetic particles.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Although RAD does not measure magnetic fields, the resulting Forbush decrease is used as indirect evidence for CME passage and magnetic cloud effects.

### 5. Coronagraph and EUV Imagers (SOHO/LASCO, STEREO COR2, and SDO/AIA)
- **General Comments**:
  - These remote-sensing instruments were used to observe coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the magnetic cloud studied in situ by the inner heliospheric spacecraft.
  - The LASCO coronagraph onboard SOHO, as well as the SECCHI/COR2 instruments onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft, provided white-light images to identify and model the geometry and propagation direction of the candidate CMEs.
  - Additionally, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO was referenced for EUV images to search for low-coronal signatures or source-region sometimes associated with CMEs. In this case no clear eruptive signature was seen in the EUV.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “We acknowledge the use of the data from … the coronagraphs onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories (STEREO)” and “…the EUV images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly… show no signature of the CME on the solar surface…”
  
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Data Collection Interval**:  
  - The coronagraph images cover the period when candidate CMEs were launched. For example, one weak CME candidate (“C2”) appeared in the field of view around 11:42 UT on February 14, 2014, with other events occurring during February 13–15, 2014.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    “…we check all the CMEs with apparent angular width larger than 90° during February 13–15 … There was a weak CME entering the field of view … at about 11:42 UT on February 14 …”
- **Wavelength(s) / Detected Observable**:
  - **SOHO/LASCO & STEREO COR2**: Record visible-light images (white-light coronagraphy) providing detailed outlines, angular widths, and propagation directions of CMEs.
  - **SDO/AIA**: Provides EUV images (at multiple extreme-ultraviolet wavelengths) for diagnosing the low-coronal conditions associated with the eruption.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - These instrument observations were primarily used in a forward–modeling process (using the GCS model) to determine the CME kinematics and direction so as to associate them with the in-situ magnetic cloud.
  - The specific CME candidate related to the studied magnetic cloud (ejecta ‘E2’) was ambiguous and might be classified as a “stealth CME” due to the lack of obvious low-coronal signatures.
