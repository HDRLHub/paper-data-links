1. EINSTEIN X‐ray Detectors  
   - General Comments:  
     • These were the earliest instruments used to estimate stellar (late‐type stars) coronal temperatures. Their energy coverage was very limited (few energy channels), so the temperature measurements were subject to considerable uncertainty.  
     • They operated in the X‐ray wavelength range and measured X‐ray emissions from hot plasma.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The earliest estimates of T in a sample of late‐type stars were provided by the EINSTEIN X‐ray detectors: with a very limited number of energy channels, the resulting temperatures were subject to considerable uncertainty.”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • No specific time range is provided in the context.  

2. Hubble Space Telescope (for Lyman‐α profiles)  
   - General Comments:  
     • Used to obtain the profiles of the Lyman‐α line from several systems, which allowed researchers to estimate stellar mass loss rates (dM/dt).  
     • Operates in the ultraviolet wavelength regime (around 1216 Å).  
     • The instrument’s spectroscopic data yield physical observables such as the column density of neutral hydrogen, related to the “hydrogen wall” feature.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Wood (2018) has summarized the values obtained for dM/dt for a number of systems for which the profile of the Lyman‐α have been obtained using the Hubble telescope.”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • No explicit dates or time spans are provided in the excerpt.

3. XMM‐Newton and Chandra X‐ray Observatories  
   - General Comments:  
     • These modern X‐ray observatories provide high resolution spectroscopy that facilitates the derivation of emission measure distributions (EMDs) for low‐mass stars.  
     • They observe the stellar corona in the X‐ray wavelength range and yield physical observables such as coronal temperature and plasma emission measures.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “More recent X‐ray data, consisting of high resolution spectra obtained by XMM‐Newton and by Chandra, have allowed the derivation of emission measure distributions (EMDs).”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • No specific time ranges are mentioned.

4. LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment on SOHO)  
   - General Comments:  
     • LASCO is a white–light coronagraph that images CMEs in the Sun’s corona by blocking the bright solar disc.  
     • It has been used to statistically evaluate CME properties—such as speed (with reported averages around 779 km/sec) and widths—in the context of solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Gopalswamy et al (2009) reported that for CME’s which occur in the LASCO data, the average speed of CME’s is 779 km/sec…”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • Although the instrument’s mission has spanned many years, the text does not specify an exact time interval for the LASCO measurements in this paper.

5. Wilcox Solar Observatory  
   - General Comments:  
     • A ground–based facility that provides long–term measurements of the Sun’s magnetic field using magnetograph techniques.  
     • Its data are used to study the global solar magnetic configuration and related phenomena such as the polarity match between surface fields and interplanetary fields.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Koskela et al (2017) have reported that, in the case of a 40–year data set from the Wilcox Solar Observatory, they obtain the best matching between the polarity of the coronal field and the field measured at 1 AU…”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • 40 years (as noted in the quoted passage).

6. Radio Observations – Crosley & Osten (2018) Campaign  
   - General Comments:  
     • A radio search was conducted for Type II radio bursts associated with stellar flares on the active flare star EQ Peg.  
     • The observations targeted meter–wavelength radio emission (frequencies in the approximate range 50–200 MHz typical for solar Type II bursts) although the specific receiver/instrument is not named.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Crosley and Osten (2018) searched for Type II radio bursts in a 64–hour long observing period aimed at the active flare star EQ Peg, but detected none.”  
   - Data Collection Period 1:  
     • Observing period: 64 hours (continuous observing campaign on EQ Peg).

7. Radio Observations – Villadsen & Hallinan (2018) Campaign  
   - General Comments:  
     • Another radio observational campaign focused on detecting Type II radio bursts in flare stars.  
     • This study targeted 5 active M dwarfs using radio observations at meter wavelengths, sensitive to shock–related plasma emissions.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Moreover, no evidence for Type II bursts was obtained by Villadsen and Hallinan (2018) in 58 hours of observing 5 active M dwarfs.”  
   - Data Collection Period 1:  
     • Observing period: 58 hours in total for the sample of stars.

8. High–resolution Eclipse Imaging (Habbal et al 2010)  
   - General Comments:  
     • Ground–based observations capturing high–resolution images of the solar corona during total solar eclipses.  
     • These images reveal fine–scale coronal structures and help trace the behavior of the magnetic field in the corona.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “High resolution images of the solar corona during total eclipses (e.g. Habbal et al 2010) provide evidence that the vertical component of the field dominates in the polar regions of the Sun.”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • Seen during total eclipses; no specific date or time duration is provided.

9. EUV Observations (Klassen et al 2000)  
   - General Comments:  
     • EUV imaging has been used to detect coronal (EUV) waves which are manifestations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena in the solar corona.  
     • Such instruments typically observe in extreme ultraviolet wavelengths to capture plasma emissions in the corona.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “...as well as by coronal waves observed in EUV (Klassen et al 2000).”  
   - Data Collection Period:  
     • No explicit observing period is mentioned.

10. Moreton Wave Observations (Moreton 1960)  
    - General Comments:  
      • Moreton waves are observed in Hα and represent chromospheric manifestations of shock waves propagating through the corona.  
      • Observations typically employ ground–based Hα telescopes.  
    - Supporting Quote:  
      “An important evidence for an excitation agent spreading out from a solar flare at speeds of order 10^3 km/sec is provided by Hα waves reported by Moreton (1960)...”  
    - Data Collection Period:  
      • The seminal observations date from 1960 (as indicated by the reference), though no continuous time range is provided here.

11. In–situ Detectors on Spacecraft  
    - General Comments:  
      • These are the instruments carried on spacecraft that measure the plasma and magnetic field properties in the solar wind.  
      • They record quantities such as the magnetic field strength in interplanetary space, thus linking solar surface phenomena to space weather.  
    - Supporting Quote:  
      “...the field which can be measured by in situ detectors carried by spacecraft in the solar wind.”  
    - Data Collection Period:  
      • No specific time range or mission duration is provided in the context.
