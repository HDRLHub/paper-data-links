## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the relationship between solar magnetic field parameters and X-ray emission intensity for solar microflares (GOES classes A0.02 to B5.1) and active regions. The core analysis is based on contemporary observational data from April to July 2009, a period of very low solar activity that allowed detailed study of weak solar events. The primary data sources are three instruments aboard the CORONAS-Photon spacecraft—Solar PHotometer in X-rays (SphinX), MgXII Imaging Spectroheliometer (MISH), and Full-disk EUV Telescope (FET)—supplemented with magnetic field measurements from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on SOHO. SphinX provided X-ray spectra and fluxes for microflares, MISH provided monochromatic images of hot coronal plasma, FET was used for spatial localization and loop measurements, and MDI supplied line-of-sight magnetograms for quantifying magnetic fields and fluxes at flare sites. The relationships derived from these simultaneous datasets underpin the paper's findings about the scaling of X-ray flux with magnetic field properties, and contribute to the discussion of coronal heating mechanisms.

### SphinX on board CORONAS-Photon
- **General Comments**:
  - SphinX is used to provide X-ray spectral data and light curves for microflares in the energy range 0.5–15 keV, allowing direct measurement of flare flux, temperature, and emission measure before and during flare maxima. The data are used for both spectral analysis and time-profile studies in specific wavelength bands, particularly 1–8 Å and 2.8–36.6 Å, central to the results.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We used SphinX data to determine the temperature and the emission measure of plasma in the active region just before the ﬂare and at the moment of ﬂare maximum."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Microflare monitoring and spectral analysis
- **Time Range**: April 2009 – July 2009 (specifically for microflares with matching SphinX and MISH observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The period of observations from April to July 2009 was selected due to the low level of solar activity, which was favorable for registration of weak ﬂares."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 2.8 – 36.6 Å and 1 – 8 Å (derived from 0.5–15 keV spectra)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Then, we constructed the synthetic spectra with calculated temperature and emission measure by applying the CHIANTI atomic database (Dere et al., 1997; Landi et al., 2013) and used them to integrate the X-ray emission of the ﬂare in two spectral ranges: 2.8 – 36.6 ˚A and 1 – 8 ˚A."
- **Physical Observable**: X-ray flux time profiles, flare peak flux, flare temperature, emission measure
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The preﬂare spectra were ﬁtted by one thermal component. The spectra at the moment of ﬂare maximum were considered in the two-temperature approximation (an example of such a ﬁt is shown in Figure 1). The hot component in this case was considered as a ﬂaring one."

- **Additional Comments**: SphinX is used in both time stamping and spectral modes and allows for a 30-second temporal integration to enhance statistics at flare maxima.

### MISH (MgXII Imaging Spectroheliometer) on board CORONAS-Photon
- **General Comments**:
  - MISH provides monochromatic soft X-ray images in the MgXII resonance doublet at 8.419 and 8.425 Å, allowing identification of hot coronal plasma at ~4 MK and above. These images are spatially resolved with ~2" resolution and are calibrated to yield absolute plasma luminosities for the flaring region.
- **Supporting Quote**: "MISH is a monochromatic soft X-ray spectroheliometer that takes images in the resonance doublet of the H-like ion Mgxii (λ 8.419 and 8.425 ˚A) with a spatial resolution of about 2 arcsec."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Microflare imaging for flux and source localization
- **Time Range**: April 2009 – July 2009 (microflare events within ≤1 min of SphinX maximum)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For this period, using the SphinX events catalog, we selected the ﬂares of B-class and lower with the time gap between ﬂare maximum and the nearest MISH image of less than 1 minute."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 8.419 Å and 8.425 Å (MgXII resonance doublet)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "MISH is a monochromatic soft X-ray spectroheliometer that takes images in the resonance doublet of the H-like ion Mgxii (λ 8.419 and 8.425 ˚A)..."
- **Physical Observable**: Spatially-resolved soft X-ray images; integrated image flux (luminosity) of hot (>4 MK) plasma regions
  - **Supporting Quote**: "It is important that MISH is a calibrated instrument and allows us to obtain the luminosity of high-temperature plasma by simple integration of the emission source in the image."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for both flux measurements and, together with FET, for determining flare region location and extent.

### FET (Full-disk EUV Telescope) on board CORONAS-Photon
- **General Comments**:
  - FET is utilized for imaging the full solar disk in the FeXXIII line at 132 Å. It is used to identify, localize, and measure the spatial extent of flare regions, as well as for coordination and registration of positions for MISH images (since MISH lacks coordinate data).
- **Supporting Quote**: "To clarify the contour of the ﬂaring region and to obtain the lengths of ﬂaring loops we used FET images (Fexxiii 132 ˚A)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Imaging for loop length and flare region identification
- **Time Range**: April 2009 – July 2009
  - **Supporting Quote**: "After that we co-aligned FET and MDI data to ﬁnd these regions on the magnetograms. The period of observations, selected for the study, was characterized by a very low level of solar activity."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 132 Å (FeXXIII)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "To select the ﬂare location we used EUV images from FET telescope in the spectral line Fexxxiii 132 ˚A."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission for determining flare region size and loop length (used in scaling law analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The locations of the ﬂaring regions were determined using data of MISH and FET."
- **Additional Comments**: FET serves as a positional reference for aligning MISH and MDI data, as well as providing data for loop structure geometry.

### MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - MDI provides line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field measurements. Level 1.8 magnetograms (96 min cadence) are used directly to quantify both average field strength and total unsigned magnetic flux in microflare regions. These measurements are critical for correlating magnetic properties to X-ray flux.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The MDI data were used to calculate the strength of magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬂux in the ﬂare regions."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic field and flux measurement in flare regions
- **Time Range**: April 2009 – July 2009 (matching periods to microflare and active region observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In order to calculate the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld and its ﬂux in the region of the microﬂare, we used Level 1.8 line-of-sight MDI magnetograms with a cadence of 96 minutes."
- **Wavelength(s)**: (Continuum/Photospheric; standard MDI magnetogram wavelengths)
  - **Supporting Quote**: Not directly specified, but magnetograms are referenced as Level 1.8 line-of-sight data.
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field strength; total unsigned magnetic flux through flare area
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld was calculated in the following way (see Figure 4). First, we selected a square frame of about 5×5 arcmin size that contains the active region with the ﬂare. From this frame, in the magnetogram we excluded pixels for which the unsigned values B were 1σ lower than median unsigned B through the frame. ... Then we averaged the unsigned magnetic data through the ﬂare region to calculate the unsigned value B for this ﬂare. The magnetic ﬂux was then calculated as Φ = BS, where S is the area of the ﬂare region."
- **Additional Comments**: Data are spatially coaligned to FET and MISH frames to ensure measurement of magnetic properties over the precise flare regions.
