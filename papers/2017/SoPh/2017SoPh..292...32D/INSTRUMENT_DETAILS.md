## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study investigates long-term temporal changes in the solar EUV network segmentation-cell length scales using full-disk solar images observed in the He II 30.4 nm emission line. Full-disk EUV images from two space-based instruments—the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)—were directly processed and analyzed. Observations span from April 1996 to May 2015, with both instruments being used in overlapping and sequential time periods under quiet Sun conditions. Only event-free, non-flaring, low-noise images were included to focus on temporal trends and minimize instrumental effects. Data were processed to correct for energetic particle hits, CCD non-uniformities, and pixel scale differences, enabling direct spatial power spectrum comparison between the instruments. The study identifies and tracks changes in segmentation-cell structures on the Sun, directly tying these to specific observation dates and the He II 30.4 nm emission line. The research conclusions rely exclusively on power spectral analyses performed with these EIT and AIA datasets across the specified time intervals.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - EIT full-disk images in the 30.4 nm He II line are foundational to the study, providing the principal long-term timespan from 1996 onward for segmentation-cell analysis. Only EIT images directly acquired and processed for the dates specified are analyzed, with care taken to filter out flares and noise, to extract solar disk spatial power spectra and segmentation scales.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "EUV) images observed by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) ... during periods of quiet Sun conditions for a time interval from 1996 to 2015 were analyzed."

#### Data Collection Period 1: EIT Quiet Sun imaging, cycle minima and extended interval
- **Time Range**: 27 April 1996 – 28 May 2015 (specific dates in 1996, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Thus, the whole time interval, more than 19 years, spans more than 1.5 SC, which allowed us to estimate whether detected changes of the segmentation-cell structure follow the SC periodicity or show a different behavior. ... The full data set used for this analysis is shown in Table 1."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 30.4 nm (He II emission line)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Our analyses of absolute solar EUV irradiance during the prolonged SC 23/24 minimum in 2008 – 09 (Didkovsky et al., 2009) showed a significant decrease of the spectral irradiance in the band around the strong He ii emission line of 30.4 nm compared to the level detected for the previous minimum of SC 22/23 in 1996."
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk segmentation-cell/network structures in He II 30.4 nm EUV emission; spatial power spectrum of segmentation-cell dimensions
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The spatial power as a function of the spatial frequency from about 0.04 to 0.27 (EIT) ... depends on the distribution of the observed segmentation-cell dimensions – a structure of the solar EUV network."
- **Additional Comments**:   
  - EIT pixel scale 2.6 arcsec per pixel; images explicitly filtered to exclude flares and noisy data.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "However, they have different pixel scales, 2.6 and 0.6 arcsec per pixel for EIT and AIA, respectively. Thus, the spatial frequency units pix−1 used in Didkovsky and Gurman (2014) are changed to Mm−1 in this work."

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA EUV full-disk images in the 30.4 nm (He II) channel are used to extend and cross-validate the SOHO/EIT sequence, enabling direct, model-corrected spectral comparison for overlapping operation years (2010–2015). Only directly processed AIA observations are analyzed, extracted using similar selection, correction, and cleaning procedures as EIT data.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "For our analysis in this work we included additional low solar-activity images, EIT for 2012 – 2015 and AIA for 2010 – 2015, which have been compared to the images from 1996, 2008, and 2010. Thus, the whole time interval, more than 19 years, spans more than 1.5 SC..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: AIA Quiet Sun imaging, overlapping with late EIT interval
- **Time Range**: 26 August 2010 – 28 May 2015 (specific observation times for each analyzed day provided)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Second, starting with 2010 when SDO/AIA images became available, the current analysis compares pairs of SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA spatial spectra."
    - Supporting time list:  
      "26 Aug 10   20100826.011940   26 Aug 10   01:00:09.13 ... 28 May 15   20150528.011944   28 May 15   01:15:07.12"
- **Wavelength(s)**: 30.4 nm (He II emission line)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Didkovsky and Gurman (2014) used He ii full-disk images from EIT and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) (Lemen et al., 2012) onboard the SDO to analyze the spatial power spectra..."
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk segmentation-cell/network structures in He II 30.4 nm EUV emission; spatial power spectrum of segmentation-cell dimensions
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The spatial power as a function of the spatial frequency ... up to 0.48 (AIA) Mm−1 depends on the distribution of the observed segmentation-cell dimensions – a structure of the solar EUV network."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - AIA pixel scale 0.6 arcsec per pixel; direct corrections and model comparison with EIT for equivalent feature scale analysis.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Solar EUV images observed by SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA have different pixel scales: about 2.6 and 0.6 arcsec pix−1, correspondingly. ... This different resolution affects the visibility of small-scale solar segmentation on the disk and, thus, the spectral density in the power spectra."
