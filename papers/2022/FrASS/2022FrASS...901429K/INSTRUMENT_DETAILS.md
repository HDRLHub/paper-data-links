## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the early acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) by coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock waves in the solar corona. It utilizes telescopic observations coupled with dynamic physical models to simulate SEP acceleration and transport from the Sun to 1 AU. The study is part of the Solar Particle Radiation Environment Analysis and Forecasting – Acceleration and Scattering Transport (SPREAdFAST) project. The research involves modeling the interaction of observed off-limb coronal bright fronts (CBF) with the coronal plasma using synoptic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and simulating SEP acceleration using an analytical diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model. The results are compared with 1 AU observations for validation.

### Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The ERNE instrument is used to observe proton events in the energy range of 17-22 MeV, which are crucial for identifying SEP events and validating the model results at 1 AU.

### Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) Model
- **General Comments**:
   - The MAS model provides synoptic coronal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations used to model the coronal plasma environment through which the CME-driven shocks propagate.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The shock surface is then propagated through the solar corona up to 10 RSun, represented by the domain of the results of a Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere [32, MAS] synoptic coronal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the Carrington rotation of each event."

### Differential Emission Measure (DEM) Model
- **General Comments**:
   - The DEM model is used to estimate the emission measure and average density at the shock crossing points in the corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The emission measure and the average densities within the field of view of the AIA instrument are estimated by applying a differential emission measure (DEM) model [33] to each group of pixels surrounding the projected shock-field crossing points for every timestep."

### Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM)
- **General Comments**:
   - The EPREM model is used to simulate the transport of SEPs from the Sun to 1 AU, incorporating effects such as pitch-angle scattering, adiabatic focusing and cooling, convection, and streaming.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The final step of the modeling chain is the transport of the accelerated SEPs to 1 au, and subsequent comparison with particle observations with the ERNE instrument. This is achieved by taking the resulting averaged fluxes for the entire event (here an example with the event on May 11, 2011 is shown) as input to the modified version of the EPREM model [26], and transporting them through a Parker-type static interplanetary medium."
