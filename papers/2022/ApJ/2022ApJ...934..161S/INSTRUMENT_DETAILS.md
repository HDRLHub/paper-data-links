I'm sorry, but the context provided does not contain any specific instruments, detectors, or observational data with time ranges, wavelengths, or physical observables. The text primarily discusses theoretical models, simulations, and computational methods related to solar dynamics and helioseismology. If you have another document or specific section that includes observational instruments and data, please provide that, and I would be happy to assist further.
