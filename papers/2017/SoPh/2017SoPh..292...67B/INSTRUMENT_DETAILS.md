## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the depth of the solar minimum between Cycles 23 and 24 using helioseismology. The research centers on the direct analysis of p-mode oscillation frequency shifts, derived from Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) resolved Doppler-velocity observations. The primary data for the results are GONG standard pipeline 108-day time series frequency measurements for harmonic degrees 11 ≤ ℓ ≤ 150 and m-averaged frequencies in the range 1700 ≤ ν ≤ 4000 µHz. Three epochs are defined and used for analysis: Minimum preceding Cycle 23 ("Min23", May 7 1995 – August 11 1997), Maximum of Cycle 23 ("Max23", January 29 2000 – May 5 2002), and Minimum following Cycle 23 ("Min24", June 21 2007 – November 25 2009). The data form the basis for all frequency shift calculations and comparisons between these solar activity minima and maximum. Helioseismic frequencies from GONG constitute the sole direct observational input for the main quantitative results, while other solar activity proxies (SSN, F10.7, TSI, MWSI, MPSI, etc.) are only used for comparative context.

## Instrumentation Details

### Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
  - The GONG network provided the primary resolved Doppler-velocity timeseries from which all p-mode frequency analyses were derived. The study exclusively analyzes frequencies computed from GONG 108-day time series for the specified degrees and frequencies, using standardized fitting and processing procedures described in detail in the paper.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) makes resolved Doppler-velocity observations of the Sun. The GONG standard pipeline determines mode frequencies for oscillations with harmonic degrees in the range 0 ≤ℓ≤150. However, here we focus on those modes in the range 11 ≤ℓ≤150 as the frequencies of the lower-ℓmodes are more uncertain. Frequencies were determined using the standard GONG 108-day time series, with a start-time separation of 36 days and the frequencies can be obtained from gong2.nso.edu."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar minimum preceding Cycle 23 ("Min23")
- **Time Range**: 7 May 1995 – 11 August 1997 (inclusive); minimum preceding Cycle 23
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The minimum preceding Cycle 23 was, therefore, taken to be between 7 May 1995 and 11 August 1997 inclusive. For the remainder of the article we refer to this minimum as Min23."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly specified; resolved Doppler-velocity observations primarily in visible continuum, standard for GONG network
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) makes resolved Doppler-velocity observations of the Sun."
- **Physical Observable**: Helioseismic oscillation mode frequencies (p-modes), specifically m-averaged frequencies for ℓ = 11–150, ν = 1700–4000 µHz
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We considered oscillations with the largest amplitudes, which corresponds to oscillations with m-averaged frequencies in the range 1700 ≤νn,ℓ≤4000 µHz."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Only GONG datasets covering all required modes in this epoch were included (21 108-day GONG data sets).

#### Data Collection Period 2: Solar maximum of Cycle 23 ("Max23")
- **Time Range**: 29 January 2000 – 5 May 2002 (inclusive); maximum of Cycle 23
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We also compare the minimum preceding Cycle 23 with the maximum of Cycle 23. Again an epoch of the same length was considered, containing 21 GONG data sets and covering the period between 29 January 2000 and 5 May 2002. For the remainder of the article we refer to this epoch as Max23."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly specified; GONG Doppler-velocity in visible continuum
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) makes resolved Doppler-velocity observations of the Sun."
- **Physical Observable**: Helioseismic oscillation mode frequencies (p-modes), m-averaged, same mode selection criteria as Min23
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We only consider modes observed in all time series during both Min23 and Max23 and so for this analysis 1541 modes were included."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Used for computing frequency shifts relative to Min23.

#### Data Collection Period 3: Solar minimum following Cycle 23 ("Min24")
- **Time Range**: 21 June 2007 – 25 November 2009 (inclusive); minimum following Cycle 23
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The minimum following Cycle 23 was taken to be between 21 June 2007 and 25 November 2009 inclusive. For the remainder of the article we refer to this minimum as Min24."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly specified; GONG visible-light Dopplergrams
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) makes resolved Doppler-velocity observations of the Sun."
- **Physical Observable**: Helioseismic oscillation mode frequencies (p-modes), m-averaged, ℓ = 11–150, ν = 1700–4000 µHz
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Here we considered oscillations with the largest amplitudes, which corresponds to oscillations with m-averaged frequencies in the range 1700 ≤νn,ℓ≤4000 µHz."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Data selection and smoothing procedures to define epoch detailed in paper; 21 GONG data sets cover this epoch.
