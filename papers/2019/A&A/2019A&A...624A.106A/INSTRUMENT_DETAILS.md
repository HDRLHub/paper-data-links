## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper revisits previous claims of solar g-mode detection made by Fossat et al. (2017) and Fossat & Schmider (2018) using analyses of the power spectrum of time series of round-trip travel times of p modes. The authors make use of several helioseismic instruments and techniques, testing the effects of different sampling times, calibration strategies (including separate GOLF photomultipliers), various observation durations (16.5 years, 22 years, and independent 11‑year sub-series), and different data sources. In addition to the primary GOLF data, the study also compares results from other instruments (GONG and BiSON) to assess the robustness of the claimed detections. The various observation periods and sampling parameters are integral to the analysis and interpretation of whether the g modes are truly detected or are artefacts of the analysis.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. GOLF Instrument on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequency) is used to obtain the time series of round-trip travel times. The instrument’s data are analyzed with different sampling intervals (20 s, 60 s, and 80 s) and with two separate photomultipliers (PM1 and PM2). The study uses a newly calibrated data set (see Paper I) and examines the impact of variations such as sampling time, photomultiplier usage, and observation duration on the detection of g modes.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “We used the recently calibrated GOLF data (published in Paper I) with different sampling, different photomultipliers, different length of data for reproducing the analysis.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: 16.5-Year Time Series (as in F17)
- **Time Range**: 16.5 years (Exact start and end dates are not specified in the text, though the period is referenced as used in F17).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The procedure was applied to the new GOLF time series for two observation duration: 16.5 years as in F17 and the longest time series of 22 years obtained in Paper I.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly mentioned.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (No direct wavelength specification is provided in the text.)
- **Physical Observable**: Round-trip travel time of p modes derived from Doppler velocity measurements.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...obtained from the analysis of the power spectrum of the time series of round-trip travel time of p modes.”
- **Additional Comments**: The analysis examines the sensitivity of the detection process to changes in sampling times (20 s, 60 s, 80 s) and to the individual vs. averaged performance of the two photomultipliers.

#### Data Collection Period 2: 22-Year Time Series
- **Time Range**: 22 years (Exact dates are not specified; it is described as “the longest time series obtained in Paper I.”)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For the longest time series sampled at 80 sec, we also used two different sub-series of 11 years” and “with our new calibration (Paper I) we could extend the observation time to 22 years.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly mentioned.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Not provided.)
- **Physical Observable**: As above, the observable is the round-trip travel time of the p-mode wave packet.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The computation of the time series of round-trip travel time using the procedure given in Fossat et al. (2017) …”
- **Additional Comments**: This longer observation period is used to test how the signal-to-noise ratios of the targeted peaks (e.g., near 210 nHz, 630 nHz, 1280 nHz) behave with extended data.

#### Data Collection Period 3: 11-Year Sub-Series
- **Time Range**: Two independent 11-year sub-series:
   - One starting on April 1st, 1996.
   - Another starting on April 1st, 2007.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 3 shows the results for three different time series. ... an observation time of 11 years starting April 1st 1996 (top), for an observation of 11 years starting April 1st 2007 (middle) and an observation time of 22 years (bottom).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not provided.
- **Physical Observable**: As above, the round-trip travel time of solar p modes.
- **Additional Comments**: The analysis using these sub-series reveals that although the signal-to-noise ratios of certain peaks increase with longer observation times, the expected detections (especially the prominent 210 nHz peak) are not robust in each sub-series.

### 2. GONG Instrument (Global Oscillation Network Group)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG data are used as an independent source to test the g-mode detection claims. The instrument measures full-disk integrated velocity to study solar oscillations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For GONG we used the full-disk integrated velocity with a start date of May 1st, 1996 lasting 21.3 years.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: GONG Observation
- **Time Range**: Starting on May 1st, 1996 and lasting 21.3 years (thus, ending roughly in 2017, though the exact end date is not given).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For GONG we used the full-disk integrated velocity with a start date of May 1st, 1996 lasting 21.3 years.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Not provided.)
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk integrated velocity which provides measurements related to solar radial motion.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...measuring solar radial velocities …” (implied by the instrument’s design and the context of helioseismic observations).
- **Additional Comments**: The analysis with GONG data did not confirm the g-mode detections claimed in F17.

### 3. BiSON Instrument (Birmingham Solar Oscillation Network)
- **General Comments**:
   - BiSON data, which offer performance-check data from solar radial velocity measurements, are used for an independent check on the g-mode detection claims.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For BiSON, we used the performance-check data …”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: BiSON Observation
- **Time Range**: Starting on May 1st, 1996 and lasting 20 years.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For BiSON, we used the performance-check data truncated to starting on May 1st, 1996 lasting 20 years.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly mentioned.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Not provided.)
- **Physical Observable**: Measurements of solar radial velocities.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...instruments … measuring solar radial velocities.” (contextually associated with BiSON and GONG).
- **Additional Comments**: Similar to the GONG instrument, BiSON data do not corroborate the g-mode detection claims observed in the GOLF data analysis.
