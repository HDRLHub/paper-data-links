# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the presence and statistical properties of strong coronal magnetic fields in solar active regions (ARs) using high-frequency gyroresonant (GR) emission observed at 34 GHz. The study utilizes a historical dataset from the Nobeyama RadioHeliograph (NoRH) spanning over two solar cycles (1995–2018). The primary objective is to identify and analyze bright GR sources at 34 GHz to quantify the strongest coronal magnetic fields during solar cycles 23 and 24. The paper also examines the association of these strong magnetic fields with solar activity manifestations such as flares, sunquakes, and solar energetic particle (SEP) events.

## Instrumentation Details

### Nobeyama RadioHeliograph (NoRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NoRH is used to observe the Sun at microwave frequencies of 17 GHz and 34 GHz. It provides full-disk imaging with high temporal resolution, which is crucial for identifying and analyzing bright GR sources indicative of strong coronal magnetic fields.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period for statistical analysis
- **Time Range**: 1995 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A historic record of spatially resolved microwave observations at high frequencies, 17 and 34 GHz, is available from Nobeyama RadioHeliograph for more than 20 years (1995–2018)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17 GHz and 34 GHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The main source of data used in this study is the NoRH full-disk microwave imaging observations of the Sun at 17 GHz and 34 GHz (Nakajima et al. 1994)."
- **Physical Observable**: Brightness temperature of GR sources
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Thus, observations of a bright (≳1 MK), optically thick GR source at a certain frequency f is a direct evidence that the magnetic field in the corona is at least as high as B = ne f, where n is the harmonic number; most likely n = 3."
- **Additional Comments**: The NoRH data includes radio images, correlation curves, and raw visibilities. The data is available for every observational day from 22:45 UT to 06:30 UT with a cadence of 1 second for correlation curves and 10 seconds for raw data.

### Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI provides full-disk maps of the magnetic field vector with high temporal and spatial resolution. It is used to inspect the photospheric magnetic fields in the selected ARs.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period for cross-checking magnetic field data
- **Time Range**: 2010 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SDO/HMI (Pesnell et al. 2012) produces full-disk maps of the magnetic field vector with high time (12 minutes) and spatial (≈1 arcsecond, spacing ≈0.5 arcseconds per pixel) resolution starting 2010."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field vector
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SDO/HMI (Pesnell et al. 2012) produces full-disk maps of the magnetic field vector with high time (12 minutes) and spatial (≈1 arcsecond, spacing ≈0.5 arcseconds per pixel) resolution starting 2010."
- **Additional Comments**: SDO/HMI data is used as the primary tool for inspecting the photospheric magnetic fields, with an upper limit of around 5,000 G.

### Hinode Solar Optical Telescope/Spectro-Polarimeter (Hinode SOT/SP)
- **General Comments**:
   - Hinode SOT/SP provides high-resolution magnetograms with a limited field of view. It is used to cross-check and confirm the SDO/HMI results.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period for cross-checking magnetic field data
- **Time Range**: 2006 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Hinode Solar Optical telescope Spectro-Polarimeter (Hinode SOT/SP) data is available since 2006 and provides limited field of view (FOV) magnetograms with a spatial resolution down to 0.3 arcseconds per pixel."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field vector
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Hinode Solar Optical telescope Spectro-Polarimeter (Hinode SOT/SP) data is available since 2006 and provides limited field of view (FOV) magnetograms with a spatial resolution down to 0.3 arcseconds per pixel."
- **Additional Comments**: Hinode SOT/SP data offers lower cadence but higher sensitivity and spatial resolution compared to SDO/HMI.

### Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/MDI provides line-of-sight observations of the photospheric magnetic field. It is used for earlier cases before the availability of SDO and Hinode data.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period for earlier cases
- **Time Range**: 1995 – 2010
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For earlier cases that occurred before Hinode and SDO, we used the line of sight (LOS) observations made with Michelson Doppler Imager instrument on-board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) (Scherrer et al. 1995)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For earlier cases that occurred before Hinode and SDO, we used the line of sight (LOS) observations made with Michelson Doppler Imager instrument on-board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) (Scherrer et al. 1995)."
- **Additional Comments**: SOHO/MDI has limitations in measuring very strong magnetic fields, with an upper limit of around 3,000 G.

### GOES X-ray Sensors
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES X-ray sensors provide soft X-ray light curves used to identify flaring activity and filter out flare-related radio emissions.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation period for identifying flares
- **Time Range**: Continuous
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Soft X-ray light curves from GOES were used to identify flaring activity."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.5–4.0 Å and 1.0–8.0 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Soft X-ray light curves from GOES were used to identify flaring activity."
