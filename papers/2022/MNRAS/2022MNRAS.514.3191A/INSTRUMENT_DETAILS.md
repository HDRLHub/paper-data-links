## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the impact of solar wind plasma on radio signal delay, which is crucial for solar and planetary science. It examines the accuracy of current models used to account for these delays in spacecraft tracking observations, particularly for Mars. The study evaluates alternative models based on in situ solar wind density data from OMNI and the ENLIL numerical model. The primary goal is to improve the precision of planetary ephemerides by better accounting for solar wind delays.
