## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
This paper presents an analysis of magnetic reconnection rates and fluxes associated with a set of 51 solar flares (32 confined, 19 eruptive) ranging from GOES class B3 to X17. The primary research objective is to establish the correlation between reconnection flux and the energy released during flares, using direct observations. The study utilizes full-disk Hα filtergrams to identify flare ribbons and co-registered line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from SOHO MDI (for events from 2000 to 2010) and SDO HMI (for events from May 2010 onwards) to derive underlying magnetic fields. Specific observation periods for each flare are detailed in the event table, typically spanning from 5 minutes before flare onset to 5 minutes after its end, with exact times provided for each event. Two large flares are supplemented with filtergrams from Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) and the Improved Solar Observing Optical Network (ISOON). The analysis forms the basis of the derived reconnection parameters that underpin the paper’s major findings.
  
## Instrumentation Details

### Full-disk H-alpha Imaging System at Kanzelhöhe Observatory (KSO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Hα filtergrams from the KSO are employed as the primary means to identify and track flare ribbons for all but two events (where supplementary observatory data is used). Data undergoes normalization and pre-processing to ensure consistency across the different CCDs and telescopes used over the multi-year interval.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "High-cadence Hα filtergrams are provided by Kanzelhöhe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO; http://kso.ac.at). We selected the events based on the flares observed by KSO"

#### Data Collection Period 1: Main statistical flare sample (2000–2015, 49 out of 51 flares)
- **Time Range**: [For each event, typically from 5 minutes before flare start time to 5 minutes after flare end time, specific dates and times per event are listed in Table 2—spanning from 2000 June 01 through 2015 June 25]
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each event, our analysis is based on a time series of Hα filtergrams starting 5 minutes prior to the nominal flare start time and ending 5 minutes after the nominal end time. The respective times and can be found in Table 2 and are taken from the list of observed flares from KSO."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Centered on Hα spectral line (656.28 nm) with FWHM 0.07 nm (main Lyot filter); additional 10 nm FWHM interference filter for thermal protection
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The filter is a Lyot band-pass filter centered on the Hα spectral line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.07 nm. An interference filter with a FWHM of 10 nm is placed in the light path for thermal protection (Pötzi et al. 2015)."
- **Physical Observable**: Chromospheric flare ribbons (used to determine newly brightened flare pixel locations and ribbon area evolution)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The flare ribbon evolution gives indirect evidence of the magnetic reconnection process and can be observed at Hα, (E)UV and hard X-ray (HXR) wavelengths..."  
    "In each Hα filtergram of the observation series we detect those pixel, which belong to the flare ribbons."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - "Since the year 2000, three different CCD cameras were used at KSO. From 2000 on regular observations were carried out with a 1k × 1k 8-bit CCD with a spatial resolution of 2.2′′. The cadence was 1 image per minute (Otruba 1999). The CCD was replaced with a 10 bit CCD with the same number of pixels in mid 2005. The observing cadence stayed the same (Otruba & Pötzi 2003). Since the year 2008, the observations are carried out with a 2048 × 2048 pixels 12 bit CCD with a spatial resolution of approximately 1′′ per pixel, and an increased observing cadence of 6 seconds (Pötzi et al. 2015)."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Supplementary observatories (used for two flares in 2003)
- **Time Range**: 2003-10-28 (event #7, X17 flare) and 2003-10-29 (event #8, X10 flare)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Hα filtergrams for two of the flares were provided by other observatories, allowing us to include also the strongest flares in solar cycle 23 that occurred close to the disk center. For the X17 flare on 2003 October 28 we use data from Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO), and for the X10 flare on 2003 October 29 we use data from the Improved Solar Observing Optical Network (ISOON)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα, with similar filter characteristics; USO: 15-cm f/15, 12-bit CCD, ~0.6″/pix; ISOON: 12-bit CCD, ~1″/pix
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The USO high resolution Hα filtergrams are obtained by a 15-cm aperture f/15 telescope and a 12-bit CCD. The images have a cadence of approximately 30 seconds. Comparison and co-alignment with KSO data, which partially covered this event, resulted in a plate scale of ∼0.6′′. The ISOON data are obtained by a 12-bit CCD with a plate scale of ∼1′′ and a cadence of 1 minute (Neidig et al. 1998)."
- **Physical Observable**: Flare ribbons for X17 and X10 events (chromospheric emissions)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For the X17 flare on 2003 October 28 we use data from Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO), and for the X10 flare on 2003 October 29 we use data from the Improved Solar Observing Optical Network (ISOON)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - "KSO observations for the X17 flare on 2003 October 28 have large data gaps during the impulsive phase and are therefore not suitable for our analysis, while the X10 flare on 2003 October 29 occurred at KSO night."

### SOHO/MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used to provide pre-flare full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms for events before 2010 May 1. Magnetograms are registered and co-aligned with Hα ribbon images to measure the photospheric magnetic field underlying flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The Hα data set is complemented by either 96m full disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) or 720s full disk LOS magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) for flares after 2010 May 1."
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The MDI magnetograms are recorded with a CCD with 1024 × 1024 pixels and have a spatial resolution of 4′′ (Scherrer et al. 1995)."

#### Data Collection Period: Events prior to 2010-05-01
- **Time Range**: For each event before 2010-05-01, a single pre-flare magnetogram (acquired just before each specific event’s flare start time, as per Table 2)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each event we selected the latest magnetogram available before the start of the flare as listed in Table 2."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Unfiltered LOS photospheric magnetograms, Fe I line (676.8 nm)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The MDI magnetograms are recorded with a CCD with 1024 × 1024 pixels and have a spatial resolution of 4′′ (Scherrer et al. 1995)."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field underlying flare ribbons
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each time step the magnetic flux of the newly brightened flare pixels is calculated... and c) the absolute value of the LOS magnetic flux density is above the noise level."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - "The noise level used is 20 G in case of the MDI magnetograms (Scherrer et al. 1995)."

### SDO/HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for events after 2010-05-01, providing full-disk, high-resolution, 720-second cadence LOS magnetograms; used to quantify photospheric field strength underlying Hα flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The Hα data set is complemented by either 96m full disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI) or 720s full disk LOS magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) for flares after 2010 May 1."
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "HMI provides 4096 × 4096 pixel LOS magnetograms with a spatial resolution of about 1′′ (Schou et al. 2012). We use the 720s LOS magnetograms from HMI because of the better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the 45s LOS magnetograms (Couvidat et al. 2016)."

#### Data Collection Period: Events after 2010-05-01
- **Time Range**: For each event after 2010-05-01, a single pre-flare 720s LOS magnetogram taken just before the flare start time (see Table 2 for specific events/dates)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For each event we selected the latest magnetogram available before the start of the flare as listed in Table 2."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 617.3 nm (standard spectral line for SDO/HMI LOS observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "HMI provides 4096 × 4096 pixel LOS magnetograms with a spatial resolution of about 1′′ (Schou et al. 2012). We use the 720s LOS magnetograms from HMI because of the better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the 45s LOS magnetograms (Couvidat et al. 2016)."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field underlying Hα flare ribbons
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The magnetic flux in the newly brightened flare pixels is then used to evaluate the reconnection flux. First we calculate the difference in the reconnection flux between the time step tk and tk−1 as..."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - "For HMI 720s LOS magnetograms the photon noise is 3 G at the disk center (Couvidat et al. 2016). A noise level of 10 G is used to account for the increase of noise towards the limb."

### GOES Soft X-ray Sensor (GOES SXR)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used as reference to categorize flares (energy classification) and analyze SXR time profiles for comparison with reconnection rates derived from Hα/LOS data. GOES fluxes are not a primary data extraction source for flare ribbon/reconnection mapping but are directly used for correlation studies in this work.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The GOES class, and therefore the peak GOES 1-8 ˚A soft X-ray flux (FSXR), was taken from the flare reports from NGDC4. FSXR is used as an indicator of the flare energy."
- **Physical Observable**: 1-8 Å soft X-ray flux of the full Sun; used as proxy for total flare energy.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    "The GOES 1-8 ˚A SXR peak flux, FSXR, with the flare reconnection flux, ϕFL, of c = 0.92 (−0.05/ + 0.03) in log-log space."

### SOHO/LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used only to determine CME associations and CME kinematics for classification of events as eruptive or confined, not for direct quantification of parameters shown in principal reconnection analyses.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The CME association for the flares under study was determined using the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog 3... In addition, we verified the CME-association of the flares under study by visual comparison of LASCO-C2 observations to the flare observations..."
