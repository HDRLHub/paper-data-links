produce the script. We need to construct a query that fetches data from the Nobeyama RadioHeliograph (NoRH) for the specified time range and frequencies. Given the context, we are specifically interested in the 17 GHz and 34 GHz frequencies, which correspond to the gyroresonant emissions used to study strong coronal magnetic fields. The physical observable mentioned is the gyroresonant emission, which is crucial for our analysis. We will set up the query using SunPy's Fido interface, specifying the instrument, time range, and wavelengths based on the provided details.
