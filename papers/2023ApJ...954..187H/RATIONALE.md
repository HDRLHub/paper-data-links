produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on SOHO, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on SDO, and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) based on the specific time ranges and physical observables mentioned in the context. Since the wavelengths are not specified, we will focus on the instruments and the physical observable of Doppler velocity measurements. We will ensure that the queries are separated by the specific solar cycles as mentioned in the context.
