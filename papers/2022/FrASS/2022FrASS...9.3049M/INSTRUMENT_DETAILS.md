## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the observation and analysis of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field over two Hale cycles (approximately 22 years each) and four sunspot cycles (numbers 21 through 24). The study focuses on the Extended Solar Cycle (ESC) and its relationship with the Hale Cycle, using data from various solar observatories. The primary data sources include the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO), SOHO/MDI, and SDO/HMI, which provide insights into the Sun's toroidal and polar magnetic fields. The paper aims to unify the Hale and Extended Solar Cycle paradigms and explore their predictive capabilities for future solar activity.

## Instrumentation Details

### Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The WSO has been collecting daily low spatial resolution observations of the Sun's global magnetic field since May 1975. These observations are crucial for identifying large-scale, long-lived patterns in the Sun's magnetic field.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) began collecting daily low spatial resolution observations of the Sun’s global (or mean) magnetic field in May 1975 (Scherrer et al., 1977)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observations of the Sun's magnetic field
- **Time Range**: May 1975 – Present
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) began collecting daily low spatial resolution observations of the Sun’s global (or mean) magnetic field in May 1975 (Scherrer et al., 1977)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe I 5247 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "taking a 15s integration of the Fe I 5247 Å line at 195 points on the solar disk."
- **Physical Observable**: Global magnetic field, polar magnetic fields, toroidal magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a very well-known data product of WSO is the evolution of the Sun’s polar cap magnetic fields (Svalgaard et al., 1978)."
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the daily WSO magnetograms are obtained by scanning boustrophedonically along 11 east-west rows."
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the daily WSO magnetographs can be decomposed into the poloidal and toroidal components."

### SOHO/MDI (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Michelson Doppler Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO/MDI provides higher spatial resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic field, complementing the data from WSO.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The alternating toroidal field patterns clearly visible in the WSO observations are borne out also with considerably higher spatial resolution observations from space with SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI."

#### Data Collection Period 1: High-resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic field
- **Time Range**: Prior to May 2010
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The vertical dashed line in Panel B indicates the transition from observations from SOHO/MDI (prior to May 2010) and SDO/HMI (following May 2010)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Toroidal magnetic field
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The alternating toroidal field patterns clearly visible in the WSO observations are borne out also with considerably higher spatial resolution observations from space with SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI."

### SDO/HMI (Solar Dynamics Observatory / Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/HMI continues the high-resolution observations of the Sun's magnetic field, following SOHO/MDI.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The alternating toroidal field patterns clearly visible in the WSO observations are borne out also with considerably higher spatial resolution observations from space with SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI."
