## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed multiwavelength investigation of three TeV-detected gamma‐ray bursts (GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, and GRB 190829A). The study analyzes both the prompt and afterglow phases using a variety of space‐ and ground‐based instruments. Data are obtained from high‐energy detectors aboard Swift and Fermi satellites (covering γ‐rays and X‐rays), as well as from optical telescopes (10.4m GTC and 1.3m DFOT), and from several radio arrays and very high energy (VHE) facilities (H.E.S.S. and MAGIC). Observation times range from prompt trigger times (with durations spanning seconds to minutes) to late time follow up (extending to hours and even tens of thousands of seconds post-trigger). These precise timing and spectral measurements are critical for understanding the emission mechanisms, afterglow decay, redshift, and overall energetics of the GRBs.
