1. Fermi Gamma‐ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
   - Instrument Role: Detects gamma‐ray bursts (GRBs) and provides trigger alerts for GRB events.
   - Time Range: Used to report GRBs during the O3a run—from 2019 April 1 15:00 UTC to 2019 October 1 15:00 UTC.
   - Wavelength/Observables: Sensitive to gamma‐ray photon energies (as described in Meegan et al. 2009); the paper does not specify exact energy ranges but GBM is known to operate from keV up to tens of MeV.
   - Additional Context: The GBM triggers were used as input for the GW follow‐up analyses, ensuring that any GRB detected by Fermi during the O3a period could be cross searched in gravitational‐wave data.

2. Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
   - Instrument Role: Detects GRBs and rapidly provides precise localization; its alerts and catalogs are used to select GRB events for follow‐up.
   - Time Range: GRBs detected during the same O3a period—from 2019 April 1 15:00 UTC to 2019 October 1 15:00 UTC.
   - Wavelength/Observables: Observes in the gamma-/X‐ray band (typical operational energy range is in the tens to a few hundred keV, as indicated by Gehrels et al. 2004 and Barthelmy et al. 2005), which allows for identification of prompt GRB emission.
   - Additional Context: Swift/BAT localizations (with error radii sometimes as low as a few arcminutes) complement the Fermi triggers; the paper specifically cites Swift data (e.g., for GRB 190610A) and uses the BAT sky localizations in the GW follow‐up analyses.

3. Advanced LIGO Detectors
   - Instrument Role: Sensitive interferometric gravitational‐wave detectors that record strain signals from astrophysical events.
   - Components: Two sites are involved—LIGO Hanford (H1) and LIGO Livingston (L1).
   - Time Range: Operated during the O3a observing run, from 2019 April 1 15:00 UTC to 2019 October 1 15:00 UTC.
   - Frequency/Observables: For the modeled (binary merger) search, the data are filtered in the 30–1000 Hz band; for the generic transient search, the analysis is focused on 20–500 Hz. The detectors measure gravitational‐wave strain amplitudes and their signal-to-noise ratios (S/N).
   - Additional Context: Data from these instruments are coherently combined with data from Virgo to search for signals coincident with GRB triggers. The on‐source windows (such as −5 s to +1 s around a GRB trigger for binary merger signals, or extended windows for generic searches) are defined in the analysis based on the GRB timing.

4. Advanced Virgo Detector
   - Instrument Role: A gravitational‐wave interferometer that contributes to the network’s ability to detect and localize GW signals.
   - Time Range: Operated in conjunction with the Advanced LIGO detectors during O3a—from 2019 April 1 15:00 UTC to 2019 October 1 15:00 UTC (when it was in observing mode).
   - Frequency/Observables: Shares similar frequency sensitivity with LIGO; its data are similarly processed in the 20–500 Hz (generic search) and 30–1000 Hz (modeled binary merger search) bands to capture the gravitational‐wave strain.
   - Additional Context: Virgo’s data are used to complement those from LIGO for both the modeled and unmodeled searches. In some GRB follow-ups, data from Virgo were the only available GW channel (as noted for specific events like GRB 190409901), affecting the effective sensitivity due to sub-optimal sky coverage.

5. Additional Gamma-Ray Observatories Mentioned
   - Instruments: INTEGRAL and KONUS-Wind
   - Instrument Role: These instruments are noted as having been “covering relevant fractions” of the sky localization regions for some GRBs, though they have lower sensitivities to short GRBs compared to Fermi-GBM and Swift/BAT.
   - Time Range: They are mentioned in the context of the O3a period without explicit operational time ranges provided.
   - Wavelength/Observables: These instruments monitor gamma rays; while specific wavelength bands are not detailed in the text, they are known to operate in high-energy gamma-ray regimes.
   - Additional Context: Their mention serves to illustrate that while Fermi-GBM and Swift/BAT are the primary sources of GRB triggers for this study, additional observatories were operational concurrently and might have contributed complementary coverage.
