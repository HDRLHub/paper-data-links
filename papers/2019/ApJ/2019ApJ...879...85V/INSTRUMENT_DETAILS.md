## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the coronal dimming associated with a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME) that accompanied a C3.7 two‐ribbon flare on 2012 September 27. The study combines spectroscopy from Hinode’s Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO to assess plasma outflows, density depletions, and the mass evolution of the CME. In addition to EUV imaging and spectroscopic diagnostics, white-light coronagraph observations from SOHO/LASCO and STEREO (COR1 and COR2) are used to trace the CME’s mass from the low corona into the outer corona. The analysis emphasizes the timing of the dimming onset and the plasma dynamics at the footpoints of the erupting filament, as well as the physical connection between the mass outflow from the low corona and the subsequent mass increase observed in the white-light CME.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Hinode/EIS on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - The Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) aboard Hinode is used to obtain spectroscopic data of the coronal dimming region. It provides information on the plasma properties by capturing emission line profiles (including intensity, Doppler shifts, and line widths) in several EUV spectral lines.
   - It is particularly used here to detect double-component spectra where a nearly stationary component and a fast upflowing plasma component are observed.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The EIS observations of the event consist of one raster taken between 23:10:27 UT and 00:20:36 UT, covering an area of 302.5′′ × 384.0′′.”

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “For this purpose, we selected the following EIS spectral lines: Fe xiii at 196.55 Å and 202.04 Å (log T [K] = 6.2), Fe xv at 284.16 Å (log T [K] = 6.3), and Si vii at 275.37 Å (log T [K] = 5.8).”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Plasma intensity, Doppler shifts (revealing outflows with velocities up to –130 km s⁻¹ in the fast upflow component and small speeds of around ± a few km s⁻¹ in the stationary component), and spectral widths.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “Distinct double component spectra indicative of the superposition of a stationary and a fast upflowing plasma component are observed … with velocities up to –130 km s⁻¹ for the Fe xiii 202.04 Å (log T [K] = 6.2) and Fe xv 284.16 Å (log T [K] = 6.3) lines.”
- **Additional Comments**: The EIS raster was performed with a 2″ slit width and a 40 s exposure per slit position over 101 steps, allowing for mapping key regions involved in the dimming.

### 2. SDO/AIA on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO is used to capture full-disk, high-resolution, multiwavelength EUV images that provide crucial context for both the evolution of the coronal dimming and detailed DEM diagnostics. The AIA data allow for tracking the evolution of plasma density in the dimming regions via the reconstructed DEM maps.
