## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study examines a magnetic evolution in a large solar region during Carrington Rotations (CRs) 2119–2121, covering the period 2012 February 4 to 2012 March 16. It employs multiwavelength and multispacecraft observations to analyze interrelated activities—including filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), coronal jets, and the formation/evolution of coronal holes (CHs)—and their links to global solar magnetic field reconfigurations. Several instruments operating in different wavelength bands and using diverse spatial and temporal resolutions were used to capture the dynamics from the photosphere to the corona, thereby providing insights into the underlying magnetic reconnection processes and associated solar features.
