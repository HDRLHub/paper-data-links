1. Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE – MAG and SWEPAM experiments)
   - General Comments:
     - ACE is a spacecraft positioned at L1 that continuously monitors the interplanetary medium. In this study its data are used to record the solar‐wind plasma, magnetic field vectors, and IMF characteristics during the SSC events of 2002.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - ACE observations were used for all 31 SSC‐led events listed in the paper. For example, Table 14 lists event-related measurements (e.g. for SSC01, SSC02, … SSC32) with discontinuity times (td) occurring between January 31, 2002 and November 26, 2002.
     - The instrument provided data continuously throughout 2002, thereby covering the entire period of solar‐wind disturbances that were linked with the SSCs.

2. Wind/WAVES
   - General Comments:
     - Wind/WAVES is the radio experiment onboard the Wind spacecraft that observes dynamic spectra of radio emissions, covering frequencies roughly from 100 kHz up to 13.8 MHz. In this study it was used to identify radio signatures such as type II and type IV bursts associated with CMEs.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - Its observations in 2002 allowed the authors to associate radio signatures with SSC‐led events. For instance, Wind/WAVES data are referenced in Table 7 for several SSCs (e.g., SSC01, SSC09, SSC10, etc.) where Wind/WAVES detections (often marked with “W” in the radio signature columns) are used to confirm the existence of type II or type IV emissions.
     - Although no specific observation “window” is given beyond the year 2002, the instrument’s data cover the same SSC events spanning from January through November 2002.

3. SOHO/EIT (Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope)
   - General Comments:
     - EIT onboard SOHO provides 2D images of the solar disk in extreme ultraviolet wavelengths; specifically, it observes at wavelengths of 30.4 nm and 19.5 nm. In the paper it is used to detect the solar sources of CMEs (active regions, filaments, flares, etc.).
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - SOHO/EIT was used during the entire period of the study (2002) for identifying CME onsets and their solar source locations.
     - The paper details using EIT images (in conjunction with other data) to timestamp the beginning of CMEs (e.g., Table 3 lists the CME “start” times as observed in SOHO/EIT images).

4. SOHO/LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph)
   - General Comments:
     - LASCO is a set of coronagraphs onboard the SOHO spacecraft used to image the solar corona and track CMEs as they evolve and expand from the Sun.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - LASCO observations in 2002 are used to measure CME parameters such as the final height in solar radii, speeds (V⊙), and acceleration. Table 3 includes details on the LASCO FOV exit time and other kinematic properties.
     - LASCO data cover the period of 2002 (within the broader operation period from 1996 to 2007) and are integral to associating solar eruptions with subsequent SSC events.

5. Cluster (Spacecraft Constellation)
   - General Comments:
     - The Cluster mission consists of multiple (four) spacecraft that carry instruments to monitor in situ conditions in the Earth’s magnetosphere. In this study, Cluster data are used to determine magnetopause positions, record magnetospheric dynamics, and to capture radio (wave) data such as auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) in association with SSC events.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - Table 9 provides a summary of magnetopause crossing information observed by Cluster for several SSC events in 2002 (e.g., for SSC06, SSC01, SSC04, etc.). The table lists the crossing times (local time and UT delays) along with SSC amplitude details.
     - Cluster observations during 2002 span events from January to November. For example, SSC06 (23 March 2002) shows a Cluster magnetopause crossing at 11:40 UT.

6. Geotail (with the Plasma Wave Instrument – PWI)
   - General Comments:
     - Geotail is an Earth‐orbiting spacecraft that, among other instruments, carries a Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI). It records dynamic spectra of plasma waves from a few Hz to about 800 kHz. In this study, Geotail/PWI data complement Cluster data to monitor in situ conditions in the magnetosphere, including shock signatures and magnetopause responses.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - Geotail PWI data were used in several SSC events (as indicated in the text and Table 9) for events when the spacecraft was positioned to observe the magnetopause and related shock signatures.
     - As with ACE and Cluster, Geotail observations in 2002 cover SSC events (for example, SSC02, SSC22, SSC29, SSC32) during the same overall period from January through November 2002.

7. SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network)
   - General Comments:
     - SuperDARN is a network of high‐frequency (HF) coherent radars dedicated to monitoring ionospheric plasma convection at auroral latitudes. The network produces global convection maps that reveal patterns such as the transpolar potential and plasma flow vortices.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - The paper presents analysis of ionospheric convection using SuperDARN data over a 48‑hour period following each SSC. For example, Figure 9 displays global convection maps obtained during SSC06 on 23 March 2002 at specific times (e.g., maps from 10:00–10:04 UT, 13:12–13:16 UT, etc.).
     - Though individual map time stamps are provided for key events, SuperDARN as an instrument provided extensive coverage throughout 2002 within the Northern Hemisphere.
 
8. CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload – Accelerometers)
   - General Comments:
     - CHAMP is a low‐orbiting satellite equipped with high-sensitivity accelerometers that measure thermospheric neutral density. The “thermospheric disturbance coefficients” are derived from CHAMP data after normalizing for variations in altitude, local time, and solar EUV flux.
   - Time Ranges and Context:
     - CHAMP measurements are used to monitor density variations along orbit segments (approximately 90 minutes long) between latitudes –50° and +50°. In the paper, CHAMP data are used to derive thermospheric responses during SSC‐led events in 2002.
     - While exact observation times per event are given in Table 10 (as maximum day-side and night-side response values), CHAMP provided continuous coverage in 2002 for these events.
