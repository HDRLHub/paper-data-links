produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) based on the specific time ranges and physical observables mentioned in the context. The script will use the SunPy library to access the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) data for these instruments. We will focus on the line-of-sight magnetic field measurements, which are crucial for studying the magnetic fluxes of solar active regions as described in the paper.
