produce the script. We need to construct queries for the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) and the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) based on the provided context. The context specifies the use of these instruments to observe UV radiation from the Sun, focusing on various wavelengths and physical observables like intensity. Given the detailed information about the instruments and their capabilities from the VSO interface, we can accurately set up our queries.
