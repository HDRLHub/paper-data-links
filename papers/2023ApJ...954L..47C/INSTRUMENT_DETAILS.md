## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of a long-duration precursor phase of a major coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on March 13, 2012. It explores the heating and slow rise of the pre-eruptive hot magnetic flux rope (MFR) through precursor reconnection above cusp-shaped high-temperature precursor loops. The study utilizes multi-wavelength and multi-perspective observational data combined with three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations to analyze the formation, heating, and early rise of the MFR. The findings suggest that the magnetic tension force within the MFR drives the slow rise, transitioning into a magnetic pressure gradient dominated regime that causes rapid acceleration during the eruption.
