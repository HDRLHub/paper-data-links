## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the phenomenon of band-split type II solar radio bursts, which are caused by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks driven by solar eruptive events such as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The study combines imaging analysis of type II radio burst band-splitting and other fine structures observed by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and extreme ultraviolet observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on September 28, 2014. The MWA provides imaging-spectroscopy in the range of 80-300 MHz with a time resolution of 0.5 seconds and frequency resolution of 40 kHz. The study aims to provide evidence that band-splitting is caused by emission from multiple parts of the shock and to examine the small-scale motion of type II fine structure radio sources in MWA images.

## Instrumentation Details

### Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MWA is a low-frequency radio interferometer capable of providing high-resolution imaging-spectroscopy. It was used to observe the harmonic band of the type II radio burst in six different spectral pickets of 2.56 MHz bandwidth each, spanning the frequency range from 79.10 to 133.36 MHz.
- **Supporting Quote**: "This type II burst was observed using the MWA, a low-frequency radio interferometer capable of providing a time and spectral resolution of 0.5 s, and 40 kHz respectively, across its 80-300 MHz observing band."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the harmonic band of the type II radio burst
- **Time Range**: September 28, 2014, 02:46:12 UT – 02:49:50 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 4(a) shows the harmonic type II source motion at 133.22 (purple) and 133.36 (red) MHz with respect to the active region for the duration of the burst, starting at 02:46:12 UT and ending at 02:49:50 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 79.10 to 133.36 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "These observations spanned the frequency range from 79.10 to 133.36 MHz with a spectral resolution of 40 kHz."
- **Physical Observable**: Harmonic band of type II radio burst, band-splitting, and fine-scale motion of radio sources
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The MWA observed the harmonic band of this radio burst in 6 different spectral pickets of 2.56 MHz bandwidth each. These observations spanned the frequency range from 79.10 to 133.36 MHz with a spectral resolution of 40 kHz."
- **Additional Comments**: The MWA data were processed using the Automated Imaging Routine for Compact Arrays for the Radio Sun (AIRCARS) to obtain high-fidelity solar radio images.

### Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA on board the SDO provides extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations. It was used to observe the eruption event associated with the type II radio burst.
- **Supporting Quote**: "This eruption event was observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the eruption event
- **Time Range**: September 28, 2014, 02:39:00 UT – 03:24:05 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "On 28/09/2014, a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-15 (GOES-15)1 M5.1 class solar flare started at 02:39:00 UT from the active region (AR) NOAA 12173 (Fig 1a). This flare was also associated with a slow CME which was first seen by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) at 03:24:05 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths (171, 193, 211 Å channels)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 2a shows radio source positions (from the 2D Gaussian fits) of these frequencies and times overplotted on the AIA image, a three colour running ratio image of the eruption produced by AIA 171, 193, 211 Å channels at 02:49:11 UT."
- **Physical Observable**: Eruption event, expanding loops of the active region, and shock front
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The EUV observations of this event show the propagation of the expanding loops of the active region (Fig 2, left panel)."
- **Additional Comments**: The AIA images were used to understand the relationship between the eruptive active region and the type II burst.

### Learmonth Spectrograph
- **General Comments**:
   - The Learmonth Spectrograph observed the type II burst, providing dynamic spectra that show both the fundamental and harmonic bands of the burst.
- **Supporting Quote**: "At 02:45 UT, the peak time of the X-ray flare, Learmonth Spectrograph observed a type II burst, the radio signature of a shock during this eruptive event (Fig 1b)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the type II burst
- **Time Range**: September 28, 2014, 02:45:00 UT – 02:49:50 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At 02:45 UT, the peak time of the X-ray flare, Learmonth Spectrograph observed a type II burst, the radio signature of a shock during this eruptive event (Fig 1b)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Fundamental and harmonic bands of the type II burst, band-splitting
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The dynamic spectra shows both fundamental (fp) and harmonic (∼2fp) of the burst. Type II radio bursts often show band-splitting (e.g. Vrsnak, B. et al. 2001), where each of the fundamental and harmonic emissions are split in to two sub-band which show the same spectral drifts."
- **Additional Comments**: The Learmonth dynamic spectra were smoothed to make the band-splitting clearer.
