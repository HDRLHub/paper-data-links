## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the source eruption, propagation, and heliospheric impacts of the 2020 November 29 coronal mass ejection (CME) and associated shock. The study utilizes remote sensing and in situ observations from multiple spacecraft, including STEREO A, Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and Wind. The research employs a potential-field source-surface model to examine coronal magnetic fields and forward models to determine the structures and kinematics of the CME and shock. The study highlights the importance of multispacecraft observations for understanding the heliospheric impacts of CMEs.

The ICME interval is from 02:23 UT to 11:40 UT on December 1."

The shock is followed by a sheath region lasting about 4 hours, and the ICME interval is determined by the electron PAD and magnetic field profiles."

### In situ instruments on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - Used to measure the solar wind and in situ observations of the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 11 shows the Wind in situ measurements probably associated with the CME, which seem to be not like a typical ICME (e.g., Zurbuchen & Richardson 2006)."

- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)

   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 11 shows the Wind in situ measurements probably associated with the CME, which seem to be not like a typical ICME (e.g., Zurbuchen & Richardson 2006). Given the large expansion of the CME and shock near the Sun, and the simulation suggests that the CME may arrive at the Earth (see Figure 8), we infer that the structure observed at Wind may be a part of the CME."
