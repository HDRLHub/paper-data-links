# Context: We want to download data for the study of NOAA Active Region (AR) 12673
# during the period of 2017 September 4 â€“ 2017 September 10. The instruments of interest
# are HMI, AIA, LASCO, GOES, and WIND/WAVES.

# Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to:
# 1. Define the time range for the data collection.
# 2. Specify the instruments and their respective observables.
# 3. Construct the queries for each instrument.
# 4. Print out the query results.

# Define the time range for the data collection
time_range = a.Time('2017-09-04', '2017-09-10')

# Construct the query for HMI (SDO)
hmi_query = Fido.search(
    time_range,
    a.Instrument('HMI'),
    a.Physobs('LOS_magnetic_field')
)
print("HMI Query Results:")
print(hmi_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# hmi_files = Fido.fetch(hmi_query)

# Construct the query for AIA (SDO)
aia_query = Fido.search(
    time_range,
    a.Instrument('AIA'),
    a.Wavelength(1600 * u.Angstrom) | a.Wavelength(171 * u.Angstrom) | a.Wavelength(193 * u.Angstrom)
)
print("AIA Query Results:")
print(aia_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# aia_files = Fido.fetch(aia_query)

# Construct the query for LASCO (SOHO)
lasco_query = Fido.search(
    time_range,
    a.Instrument('LASCO'),
    a.Physobs('intensity')
)
print("LASCO Query Results:")
print(lasco_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# lasco_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_query)

# Construct the query for GOES
goes_query = Fido.search(
    time_range,
    a.Instrument('GOES'),
    a.Physobs('intensity')
)
print("GOES Query Results:")
print(goes_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# goes_files = Fido.fetch(goes_query)

# Construct the query for WIND/WAVES
wind_waves_query = Fido.search(
    time_range,
    a.Instrument('WAVES'),
    a.Physobs('radio')
)
print("WIND/WAVES Query Results:")
print(wind_waves_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# wind_waves_files = Fido.fetch(wind_waves_query)
```

This script follows the provided context and reasoning to construct queries for the specified instruments and time range. It prints out the query results for each instrument and includes commented-out lines for fetching the data.
