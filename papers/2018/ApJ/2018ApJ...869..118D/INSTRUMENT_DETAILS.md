## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the eruption of two crossing solar filaments in NOAA active region 12113 on July 8, 2014. It utilizes multi-wavelength observations to detail the dynamics of the filament eruption, the formation of current sheets (CSs) connecting lower flare ribbons with the upper erupting filaments, and the appearance of plasmoids within the CSs. The study employs several instruments to capture these phenomena over distinct time ranges, with precise observations of temperature, emission measures (EM), and plasma motions. The data collected over specific intervals—from the early filament activation through the development of CSs and the detection of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME)—are integral to understanding the reconnection processes and plasma heating mechanisms during the eruption.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA is a set of normal incidence imaging telescopes that captures solar atmospheric images in ten wavelength channels. In this study, it was used to obtain high-cadence (12 s) multi-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images with a spatial sampling of 0.6″ pixel⁻¹. The instrument provided detailed observations of the filament eruption, current sheets (CSs), plasmoids, flare ribbons (FRs), and post-flare loops.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament Eruption Observations
- **Time Range**: 
   - The lower-lying filament F2 begins to rise at approximately 15:50 UT and meets the higher-lying filament F1 at about 16:05 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "Since ∼15:50 UT, the lower-lying ﬁlament F2 slowly rose, see Figure 1(c). It met the higher-lying crossing ﬁlament F1 at ∼16:05 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Primary observation in AIA 304 Å images is used to trace the filament eruption. Additional channels such as AIA 1600 Å, 171 Å, and others are employed for capturing flare ribbons and post-flare loops.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Along the erupting direction, denoted by a blue line AB in Figure 1(d), we make a time-slice of AIA 304 ˚A images..."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The instrument captures the slow rise and subsequent rapid eruption of filaments, allowing measurements of their velocities (e.g., a mean speed of ∼20 km s⁻¹ initially and ∼660 km s⁻¹ during the rapid phase) and accelerations.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "It indicates that the ﬁlaments ﬁrst rise slowly with a mean speed of ∼20 km s⁻¹, and then erupt quickly with a larger mean speed of ∼660 km s⁻¹ and a mean acceleration of ∼1 km s⁻²."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These observations tie directly into the overall study of magnetic reconnection and filament dynamics.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Current Sheet (CS) and Plasmoid Observations
- **Time Range**:
   - The bright structures interpreted as current sheets are observed from approximately 16:12 UT to 16:22 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Above the FRs, two sets of bright structures, connecting the lower FRs and the upper erupting ﬁlaments, were observed in AIA multi-wavelength channels from 16:12 UT to 16:22 UT."
   - **Additional Details**:
      - CS1 is specifically seen in the AIA 94 Å channel at 16:13:37 UT and disappears after around 16:17 UT.
      - CS2 is clearly outlined at 16:14:49 UT and, together with its fine thread structures, remains visible until about 16:22 UT.
      - **Supporting Quotes**:
         - "Figure 3(a) shows one CS (CS1) in AIA 94 ˚A channel at 16:13:37 UT..."
         - "The red dashed line in Figure 3(d) outlines another set of CS (CS2) at 16:14:49 UT..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - CS1 and CS2 are observed in multiple AIA channels including 94 Å, 335 Å, 193 Å, 171 Å, 131 Å, and 304 Å.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Several ﬁne structures, i.e., threads, of CS2 are detected clearly in AIA multi-wavelength channels, e.g. 335, 193, 171, 131, and 304 ˚A..."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The AIA captures the formation of CSs that connect lower flare ribbons with the erupting filaments. Plasmoids within these CSs are also tracked, with measured upward and downward speeds (∼360 km s⁻¹ upward for plasmoid P1 and ∼320 km s⁻¹ downward for plasmoid P2).
   - **Supporting Quotes**:
      - "By tracing the plasmoids, with similar shape and without sudden change... we measure the mean moving speed of the plasmoid, and obtain a mean value of 360 km s⁻¹..."
      - "From 16:14:25 UT, another plasmoid, P2 ... moved downward to the solar surface with a mean speed of ∼320 km s⁻¹..."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The multi-wavelength capability of AIA allows for the analysis of differential emission measures (DEM), revealing the temperature and density structures of the CSs and plasmoids.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - The HMI instrument provides line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms with a spatial sampling of 0.5″ pixel⁻¹ and a 45 s cadence. It is used to analyze the magnetic field evolution in the filament eruption source region.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012) line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, with spatial sampling and time cadence of 0.5″ pixel⁻¹ and 45 s, respectively, are also used to analyze the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the ﬁlament eruption source region."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - Although specific observation times are not separately detailed, the HMI data are employed concurrently with the AIA observations of the filament eruption and subsequent phenomena.

- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not applicable (observations in magnetograms rather than specific wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Maps the photospheric magnetic field distribution, highlighting features such as the complex polarity inversion lines (PILs) and the locations of the crossing filaments.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The HMI observations facilitate the interpretation of the magnetic structure related to the filament dynamics and reconnection sites.

### 3. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO/C2)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 is a white light (WL) coronagraph instrument that images the solar corona and is used in this study to track the evolution of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) following the filament eruption.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "In addition, we employ the WL coronagraph images from LASCO/C2 to study the evolution of the associated CME."
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - The associated CME was first detected in the LASCO/C2 field of view at approximately 16:36 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Since 16:36 UT, an associated CME, with a mean speed of ∼400 km s⁻¹, was detected in the FOV of LASCO/C2..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Observations are in white light; no specific wavelength band is provided.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - LASCO/C2 captures the large-scale evolution of the CME and the accompanying ray-like structures that are interpreted as manifestations of the current sheets in the wake of the erupting filaments.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The differing CS widths observed in LASCO/C2 (∼40 Mm) compared to those in AIA images highlight the impact of instrument spatial sampling and emission mechanisms.
