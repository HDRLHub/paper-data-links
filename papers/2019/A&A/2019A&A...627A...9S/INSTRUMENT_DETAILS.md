## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study compares extrapolations of the coronal magnetic‐field structure at 2.5 R⊙ with white–light coronagraphic observations. To minimize the impact of solar rotation and temporal evolution, the authors construct a near‐synchronic Carrington map of the entire corona by combining images from several instruments that observe the Sun from different viewpoints. The primary data are white–light images collected during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2091, spanning 2009 December 07 to 2010 January 03, with a reference time near 20 December 2009. The paper details how such multi–viewpoint observations from space‐borne coronagraphs can be merged and compared with magnetic field extrapolations (using PFSS techniques), thus providing a rapid check on the reliability of the various extrapolation methods.

   - LASCO–C2 is a white–light coronagraph designed to image the solar corona at a height of approximately 2.5 R⊙. Its observations capture brightness enhancements corresponding to electron density features such as streamers.
   - In this study, LASCO/C2 data are a central component in constructing the Carrington map of the corona.

### 2. STEREO-A/SECCHI–COR1 on board STEREO-A (STA)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SECCHI–COR1 coronagraph on STEREO-A captures white–light images of the corona similarly to LASCO/C2, but from a different viewing angle.
   - Its images are used in combination with those from SOHO and STEREO-B to build a quasi–synchronic Carrington map.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  “...the two STEREO/SECCHI–COR1” and “the STEREO–SOHO separation angles (θ) were 64◦(STA)... on 20 December 2009, 20:20 UT…”  
  (from Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2)

#### Data Collection Period 1: Near-Reference Observation Interval
- **Time Range**: Contributing observations within CR 2091, with key geometry referenced at 20 December 2009, 20:20 UT; the merged map spans a window of approximately ±2 days around 20 December 2009, with STA’s image effectively contributing from about 1.1 days away from the reference time.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “the slice contributing mostly to the merged slice (black line) is the one with ∆ti at that longitude of 1.1 days (slice of STB/E, cyan line)”  
     (from Fig. 4 description, noting similar time‐reference strategy applicable to STA)

     “…Carrington maps at 2.5 R⊙…”  
     (from Fig. 2 and supporting text)
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal brightness enhancements that trace the locations of streamers.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “…regions of enhanced electron density…”  
     (from the description of the white–light features)
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - STEREO-A observes the corona from a vantage point rotated approximately +64◦ relative to SOHO, effectively imaging structures about 5 days later than those observed by SOHO.

### 3. STEREO-B/SECCHI–COR1 on board STEREO-B (STB)
- **General Comments**:
   - Like STEREO-A’s COR1, STEREO-B/SECCHI–COR1 obtains white–light images of the solar corona. Its perspective complements those from SOHO and STEREO-A.
   - The different viewing angles allow the construction of a combined map with minimal temporal evolution effects.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  “...the two STEREO/SECCHI–COR1” and “the STEREO–SOHO separation angles (θ) were ... −67◦(STB) on 20 December 2009, 20:20 UT…”  
  (from Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2)

#### Data Collection Period 1: Near-Reference Observation Interval
- **Time Range**: As part of CR 2091, with observations referenced to 20 December 2009, 20:20 UT; with STB’s contributions observed roughly 5 days before the reference time.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “...after ∼5 days the same structures seen by SOHO are observed by STA and were observed ∼5 days before by STB.”  
     (from Sec. 2.1)
- **Wavelength(s)**: White–light imaging at 2.5 R⊙.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “…Carrington maps at 2.5 R⊙…”  
     (from Fig. 2 and accompanying text)
- **Physical Observable**: Intensity peaks corresponding to enhanced electron density that reveal coronal streamers.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “…the observed streamers… are the result of the line–of–sight viewing of the heliospheric plasma sheet…”  
     (from Sec. 2.3)
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The timing from STB, being approximately 5 days ahead (or before the reference time in the combined view), is essential for reducing the effect of the corona’s temporal evolution.
