## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of bipolar active regions (ARs) on the Sun that violate Hale's polarity law, known as anti-Hale ARs. By combining data from five solar cycles (16–18 and 23, 24), the authors compile a synthetic cycle to improve the statistics of these rare events. The study aims to understand the temporal and latitudinal distribution of anti-Hale ARs and their potential connection to the global solar dynamo mechanism. The data spans from 1919 to 1959 and from 1989 to 2021, utilizing various solar observation instruments and catalogs.
