# Context: We are interested in downloading data related to the reconstruction of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) over the last five centuries.
# Specifically, we need data on Ca II K spectroheliogram observations, sunspot group area measurements, solar modulation potential, and PMOD composite TSI measurements.

# Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We will:
# 1. Query for Ca II K spectroheliogram observations.
# 2. Query for sunspot group area measurements.
# 3. Query for solar modulation potential.
# 4. Query for PMOD composite TSI measurements.

# Step 1: Query for Ca II K spectroheliogram observations
# Note: The VSO interface provided does not list Ca II K spectroheliogram observations directly. We will assume it is part of the KPVT or MLSO datasets.
# For the purpose of this example, we will use the KPVT instrument as a proxy.

# Define the time range for Ca II K spectroheliogram observations
time_range_ca_ii_k = a.Time('1892-01-01', '2019-12-31')

# Define the instrument and physical observable
instrument_ca_ii_k = a.Instrument('kpvt')
physobs_ca_ii_k = a.Physobs('intensity')

# Perform the query
query_ca_ii_k = Fido.search(time_range_ca_ii_k, instrument_ca_ii_k, physobs_ca_ii_k)

# Print the query results
print("Ca II K Spectroheliogram Observations Query Results:")
print(query_ca_ii_k)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_ca_ii_k = Fido.fetch(query_ca_ii_k)

# Step 2: Query for sunspot group area measurements
# Note: The VSO interface provided does not list sunspot group area measurements directly. We will assume it is part of the SOHO MDI dataset.

# Define the time range for sunspot group area measurements
time_range_sunspot = a.Time('1874-01-01', '2019-12-31')

# Define the instrument and physical observable
instrument_sunspot = a.Instrument('mdi')
physobs_sunspot = a.Physobs('intensity')

# Perform the query
query_sunspot = Fido.search(time_range_sunspot, instrument_sunspot, physobs_sunspot)

# Print the query results
print("Sunspot Group Area Measurements Query Results:")
print(query_sunspot)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_sunspot = Fido.fetch(query_sunspot)

# Step 3: Query for solar modulation potential
# Note: The VSO interface provided does not list solar modulation potential directly. This data is typically derived from cosmogenic isotope measurements and may not be available in VSO.

# Define the time range for solar modulation potential
time_range_solar_modulation = a.Time('1000-01-01', '2001-12-31')

# Since this data is not available in VSO, we will skip the query and assume it is obtained from external sources.

# Step 4: Query for PMOD composite TSI measurements
# Note: The VSO interface provided does not list PMOD composite TSI measurements directly. This data is typically obtained from various space missions and may not be available in VSO.

# Define the time range for PMOD composite TSI measurements
time_range_tsi = a.Time('1978-01-01', '2019-12-31')

# Since this data is not available in VSO, we will skip the query and assume it is obtained from external sources.

# Summary:
# We have constructed queries for Ca II K spectroheliogram observations and sunspot group area measurements using the available VSO interface.
# The solar modulation potential and PMOD composite TSI measurements are assumed to be obtained from external sources.

# Note: The actual data fetching commands (Fido.fetch) are commented out to avoid running them in this script.
