# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the numerical nuances of global coronal models, particularly focusing on the boundary conditions and grid design to improve the accuracy and efficiency of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. These simulations are crucial for forecasting solar weather and are used in tools like the ESA Modelling and Data Analysis Working Group (MADAWG) magnetic connectivity tool. The study emphasizes the importance of reducing artificial electric field generation and investigates the effects of different boundary condition formulations and grid designs on the results and convergence of the simulations. The paper uses the example of the 2008 solar eclipse to illustrate the significant improvement in accuracy of real magnetic map-driven simulations.

## Instrumentation Details

### MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI instrument on SOHO was used to obtain the magnetic map data for the 2008 solar eclipse simulation. This data is crucial for prescribing the radial component of the magnetic field on the inner boundary of the domain in the MHD simulations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetic map used was an MDI map with lmax of 25 (Scherrer et al. 1995)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: 2008 Solar Eclipse
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the context, but the data pertains to the 2008 solar eclipse.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The solar eclipse from 2008 was investigated, the magnetic map of which (in combination with the PFSS solution for Bθ) is shown in Figure 20."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the context.
   - **Supporting Quote**: N/A
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field components (Br and Bθ)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetic map used was an MDI map with lmax of 25 (Scherrer et al. 1995)."
- **Additional Comments**: The MDI data was used in combination with the PFSS (Potential Field Source Surface) solution for Bθ to set up the initial conditions for the MHD simulations.
