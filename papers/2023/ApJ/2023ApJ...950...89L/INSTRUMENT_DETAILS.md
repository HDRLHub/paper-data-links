## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper analyzes high-energy (>40 MeV) proton intensity enhancements associated with the passage of interplanetary shocks at 1 AU, observed over a 43-year period (1973–2016). These enhancements are typically linked to large solar energetic particle (SEP) events, which may or may not originate from the shocks themselves. By focusing on cases where shocks can be confidently associated with the solar eruptions that generated the SEP events, the study examines the components of these SEP events that are localized near the shock, known as energetic storm particles (ESPs). The analysis explores the relationship between the properties of solar eruptions, shock parameters, and the observed high-energy ESPs. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding particle acceleration processes and improving SEP event forecasting models.

## Instrumentation Details

### Goddard Medium Energy (GME) on board Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-8 (IMP-8)
- **General Comments**:
   - The GME instrument was used to initially identify periods with elevated >40 MeV proton intensities, providing crucial data for the early part of the study period.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Initial identification of elevated proton intensities
- **Time Range**: November 1973 – October 2001
   - **Supporting Quote**: "An initial identification of the periods with elevated >40 MeV proton intensities was made using data from the Goddard Medium Energy (GME) instrument on board the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-8 (IMP-8) covering the time interval from 1973 November to 2001 October."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities in the range of 42.9–51.0 MeV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In particular, we selected periods when the 42.9–51.0 MeV proton intensities were above the instrumental background."
- **Additional Comments**: The data from GME was crucial for identifying significant periods of interest over the extensive study timeline.

### Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - ERNE data was used to extend the analysis of elevated proton intensities beyond the operational period of IMP-8/GME.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Extension of elevated proton intensity analysis
- **Time Range**: October 2001 – December 2006
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In order to extend the analysis from 2001 October to 2006 December, we also checked for periods when the 40.5–53.5 MeV proton energy channel of the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was elevated above the intensity instrumental background."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities in the range of 40.5–53.5 MeV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In particular, we selected periods when the 40.5–53.5 MeV proton energy channel of the ERNE instrument was elevated above the intensity instrumental background."
- **Additional Comments**: The use of ERNE data allowed for the continuation of the study after the end of IMP-8 data availability, ensuring a comprehensive analysis up to 2006.

### Solar Energetic Particle Environment Modeling (SEPEM) Reference Data Set on board Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)
- **General Comments**:
   - SEPEM data was utilized to substantiate the identification of periods with elevated >40 MeV protons, using cross-calibrated data with IMP-8/GME.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Substantiation of elevated proton intensity periods
- **Time Range**: Throughout the study period, particularly post-2001
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Therefore, we used the 45.7–66.1 MeV proton intensities from the SEPEM/RDS data set to substantiate the identification of periods with elevated >40 MeV protons."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities in the range of 45.7–66.1 MeV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Therefore, we used the 45.7–66.1 MeV proton intensities from the SEPEM/RDS data set to substantiate the identification of periods with elevated >40 MeV protons."
- **Additional Comments**: SEPEM data, being cross-calibrated with IMP-8/GME, provided a reliable continuation of the dataset for analyzing proton intensities, ensuring consistency in the long-term study.
