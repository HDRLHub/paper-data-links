## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the observation of a complex coronal web in the middle corona of the Sun, which drives the highly structured slow solar wind. The study utilizes extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the GOES Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) and white-light images from the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the SOHO spacecraft. These observations reveal dynamic interactions and reconnections within magnetized plasma structures, which are linked to the emergence of slow wind streams. Advanced 3D MHD coronal models are employed to demonstrate that these observations are manifestations of the magnetic separatrix web (S-web), which plays a crucial role in the generation of slow solar wind. The paper highlights the importance of understanding these middle coronal processes to better comprehend the origins and drivers of the structured slow solar wind.

## Instrumentation Details

### GOES Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board GOES Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - SUVI was used to observe the middle corona, capturing the dynamics associated with the structured slow solar wind through its extended field of view. It utilized EUV imaging to trace features up to about 2.7 solar radii.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the middle corona
- **Time Range**: 2018-08-07 – 2018-09-13
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
- **Physical Observable**: EUV features of the corona, including coronal holes and active regions
- **Additional Comments**: The observations included a special off-pointing campaign that allowed for the extended field of view necessary to capture the middle corona dynamics.

### Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO was used in conjunction with SUVI to observe the outer corona in white-light, extending the field of view beyond that of SUVI and providing a comprehensive view of the corona up to about 6 solar radii.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Complementary observations with SUVI
- **Time Range**: 2018-08-07 – 2018-09-13
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light
- **Physical Observable**: White-light coronagraphic images of the corona
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO data was processed and merged with SUVI data to enhance the visibility of coronal structures and to trace the solar wind streams in the extended corona.

### Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) on board SDO Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO provided contextual data of the lower corona and photospheric magnetic fields, which were crucial for understanding the magnetic environment associated with the observed coronal web.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Contextual observations of the lower corona and photospheric magnetic fields
- **Time Range**: 2018-08-08 – 2018-09-09
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å (EUV filters)
- **Physical Observable**: Lower-coronal structures and magnetic field maps
- **Additional Comments**: Full-disk images and magnetic field maps were used to analyze the evolution of coronal structures and their magnetic properties over the course of the observation period.

These instruments and their observations provided a multi-dimensional view of the solar corona, enabling a detailed study of the mechanisms driving the slow solar wind and highlighting the dynamic nature of the middle corona.
