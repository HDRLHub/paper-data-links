## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of water production in 61 comets observed over a twenty‐one year period (1996–2016) using the SWAN instrument on board the SOHO satellite. By analyzing over 3700 full‐sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha images using a time‐resolved modeling approach (TRM), the authors derive water production rates and investigate variations both before and after perihelion. The study also makes dynamical and compositional comparisons and contextualizes its findings with observations from other instruments such as the Rosetta VIRTIS spectrometer and OSIRIS camera, as well as surface imaging from the Dawn spacecraft.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SWAN Instrument on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The SWAN (Solar Wind ANisotropies) instrument is an all‐sky camera mounted on the SOHO satellite. It has been operating from shortly after its launch (2 December 1995) and has continuously monitored the entire sky to map the hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission.
  - It consists of two systems (one for the north heliographic hemisphere and another for the south) and includes a 5×5 array of detectors where each detector covers one square degree.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) instrument on board the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite has been operating in a halo orbit around the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point since shortly after its launch on 2 December 1995."
  - "After more than 20 years in operation it is still providing excellent measurements of hydrogen in both the interplanetary medium... and comets."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Extended Survey Observations
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2016  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "A Survey of Water Production in 61 Comets from SOHO/SWAN Observations of Hydrogen Lyman-alpha: Twenty-One Years 1996-2016"
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Primarily the Hydrogen Lyman-alpha line (approximately 121.6 nm in the far ultraviolet range).  
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "Nearly 98% of the total far ultraviolet emission is typically in Lyα..."
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - The spatial brightness distribution of hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission which is used to determine water production rates in cometary comae.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Although the detector is a broadband far-ultraviolet device with sensitivity on either side of Lyα, the vast majority of the emission observed from comets is concentrated in the Lyman-alpha line.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Targeted Comet Observations
- **Time Range**: Specific comet apparitions with documented observation windows (e.g., the image of comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd) on 1 November 2011 demonstrates a typical instance).  
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "Figure 1 shows the portion of the full-sky image of 1 November 2011 centered on comet C/2009 P1 (Garradd)..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Hydrogen Lyman-alpha.
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - The detailed brightness profile of cometary hydrogen emission, enabling precise determinations of water production and temporal evolution.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The data are analyzed using a time-resolved model (TRM) that incorporates both the cometary emission and background interplanetary medium (IPM) contributions.

### 2. Rosetta VIRTIS Spectrometer on board Rosetta
- **General Comments**:
  - The VIRTIS spectrometer aboard the Rosetta spacecraft was used to obtain infrared spectra that reveal surface and near-surface ice deposition on comet nuclei.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "De Sanctis et al. (2015) have shown the deposition of surface and/or near surface ice from infrared spectra obtained with the Rosetta VIRTIS spectrometer as regions of the comet rotate into darkness..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**:  
    - No explicit overall operational time range is provided, but the observations describe diurnal effects where water signature decreases within about one hour when a region rotates out of sunlight.
  - **Supporting Quote**:
    - "...when the region returns into sunlight on the next rotation the water signature decreases in an hour..."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Infrared wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Variations in water ice deposition detected through changes in the infrared spectral signature during the comet's rotation.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - These observations help to illustrate transient surface changes driven by solar illumination and sublimation processes.

### 3. Rosetta OSIRIS Camera on board Rosetta
- **General Comments**:
  - The OSIRIS camera on the Rosetta spacecraft provided high-resolution multicolor imaging of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, capturing color variations that indicate changes in surface composition.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "Fornasier et al. (2016) have shown from multicolor imaging of 67P with the Rosetta OSIRIS camera that the nucleus is overall 'bluer' near perihelion than farther from perihelion..."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**:  
    - Specific operational time ranges are not detailed; the observations are related to the comet’s rotation and orbital progress, particularly around perihelion.
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - Visible wavelengths (multicolor imaging).
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Surface color variations that serve as proxies for water ice exposure and the evolution of the surface layers.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The color change is interpreted as evidence of fresh water ice exposure near perihelion, supporting models of seasonal activity and surface evolution.

### 4. Dawn Spacecraft (Surface Imaging at Ceres)
- **General Comments**:
  - The Dawn spacecraft has provided imaging observations of the surface of Ceres, revealing patterns of ice assembly and loss that suggest a seasonal water cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "Even at larger heliocentric distance evidence for similar surface reprocessing in the form of ice and rock flow and fall has been very recently reported by Raponi et al. (2018) at the surface of Ceres by the Dawn spacecraft."
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - **Time Range**:  
    - An explicit time range is not provided in the text; the observations are noted as recent in the context of the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  - The specific wavelengths are not detailed in the text, but the imaging likely covers visible and/or infrared ranges.
- **Physical Observable**:  
  - Surface features that indicate seasonal processes such as ice deposition, sublimation, and the resulting morphology changes.
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - The Dawn observations complement the comet studies by providing insight into water-related surface processes on another small Solar System body.
