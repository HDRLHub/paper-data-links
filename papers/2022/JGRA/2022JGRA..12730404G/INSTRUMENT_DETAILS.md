## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the solar and interplanetary causes behind the third largest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 24, which occurred on August 26, 2018. The study focuses on the coronal mass ejection (CME) originating from a quiescent filament region and its evolution into a magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 AU. The paper examines the prolonged acceleration of the CME, its complex rotation, and the high-density content within the MC, which contributed to the intense geomagnetic storm. The study utilizes various observational data from instruments on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), and other sources to track the CME and analyze its properties.
