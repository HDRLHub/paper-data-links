**produce the script**. We need to construct queries for the Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) and integrate data from space-based instruments like SOHO/LASCO for a comprehensive study of CMEs from 1980 to 2013. The script will focus on querying the VSO for the specified instruments and time ranges, reflecting the data used in the context provided.

**Script**:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation periods for Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters at MLSO
mk3_time_range = a.Time('1980-02-04', '1999-09-30')
mk4_time_range = a.Time('1999-10-01', '2013-12-31')

# Instruments at MLSO
mk3_instrument = a.Instrument("mk3")
mk4_instrument = a.Instrument("mk4")

# Wavelengths are in the visible range, but specific values are not provided in the context
# Using a general visible light range for the query
visible_wavelength = a.Wavelength(4000 * u.Angstrom, 7000 * u.Angstrom)

# Construct queries for Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters
mk3_query = Fido.search(mk3_time_range, mk3_instrument, visible_wavelength)
mk4_query = Fido.search(mk4_time_range, mk4_instrument, visible_wavelength)

# Display the query results for Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters
print("Query for Mk3 Coronameter Data:")
print(mk3_query)
print("Query for Mk4 Coronameter Data:")
print(mk4_query)

# Additional space-based instruments: SOHO/LASCO
# Time range for combined observations with MLSO instruments
space_based_time_range = a.Time('1980-02-04', '2013-12-31')
lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")

# LASCO C2 and C3 detectors are specifically mentioned in the VSO interface
lasco_c2_query = Fido.search(space_based_time_range, lasco_instrument, a.Detector("C2"))
lasco_c3_query = Fido.search(space_based_time_range, lasco_instrument, a.Detector("C3"))

# Display the query results for LASCO C2 and C3 detectors
print("Query for LASCO C2 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c2_query)
print("Query for LASCO C3 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c3_query)

# Uncomment the lines below to download the data
# mk3_files = Fido.fetch(mk3_query)
# mk4_files = Fido.fetch(mk4_query)
# lasco_c2_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_c2_query)
# lasco_c3_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_c3_query)
```

This script is designed to query the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for data from the Mk3 and Mk4 coronameters at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) and the SOHO/LASCO space-based instruments, covering the time range from 1980 to 2013. The queries are specific to the instruments and time ranges mentioned in the context, and the results are displayed for review. The script includes commented out lines for data fetching, which can be enabled as needed.
