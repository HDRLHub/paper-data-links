# This script, including code comments, was initially drafted by an AI model. Please use with caution.

```python
import sunpy.net
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time ranges and instrument details based on the context provided
time_range_1 = a.Time('2010-08-14 08:40', '2014-12-21 10:50')
time_range_2 = a.Time('2017-10-25 06:45', '2021-11-17 08:00')
instrument = a.Instrument('AIA')
wavelength = a.Wavelength(193 * u.Angstrom)

# Construct the first query for the general CME detection and analysis period
query_1 = Fido.search(time_range_1, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query 1 Results:")
print(query_1)

# Construct the second query for the verification against CDAW catalogue period
query_2 = Fido.search(time_range_2, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query 2 Results:")
print(query_2)

# Uncomment the following lines to fetch the data
# files_1 = Fido.fetch(query_1)
# files_2 = Fido.fetch(query_2)
```

This script constructs two separate queries using the SunPy library to search for data from the AIA instrument on board the SDO, specifically at the 193 Ã… wavelength. The time ranges are defined based on the context provided. The results of the queries are printed out, and the data fetching commands are commented out.
