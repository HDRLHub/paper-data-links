## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper introduces a new semi-empirical model named 3DCORE for simulating the propagation of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic flux ropes through the inner heliosphere. The model integrates solar imaging, coronagraph, and in situ measurements to constrain key parameters and predict the geomagnetic disturbance index (Dst). Observations from several spacecraft instruments—including remote-sensing imagers and in situ magnetometers at different heliocentric distances—are used to derive CME initial conditions, validate the flux rope geometry, and forecast Earth-impacting magnetic field properties. Critical observational inputs include solar disc images (revealing coronal loops and filaments), photospheric magnetograms to infer magnetic polarity and flux rope orientation, coronagraph images to track the CME evolution in the corona, heliospheric imager observations for propagation tracking, and in situ magnetic field data from MESSENGER (near Mercury) and Wind (at Earth L1). The various time ranges of these observations (ranging from early July 9 for the eruption to mid-July for in situ events) are central to linking the solar source, interplanetary propagation, and geomagnetic impact of the CME.
