## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper explores whether nanoﬂares—small, impulsive energy releases in the solar corona—can accelerate particles to high energies in a way comparable to full‐sized flares. By modeling the emission of type III radio bursts that nanoﬂares could generate on closed coronal loops, the study simulates synthetic dynamic spectra and applies a time‐lag cross-correlation technique to extract characteristic frequency–drift signatures. The paper compares emission expected from individual loops as well as ensembles (with varying loop population densities) and discusses how instrumental aspects—such as frequency resolution and noise—can impact the detectability of these bursts. A composite dynamic spectrum extracted from multiple radio instruments plays a role in illustrating the observational context.

## Instrumentation Details

### 3. WIND/WAVES RAD1 and RAD2 Receivers on Board the WIND Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - These radio receivers, aboard the WIND spacecraft, provide measurements at very low frequencies.
   - They are used in conjunction with ground-based instruments to create a composite spectrum spanning several orders of magnitude in frequency.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “and the RAD1 and RAD2 receivers onboard the WIND spacecraft (Bougeret et al. 1995) covering 14–0.1 MHz” (from text).
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation on January 28th, 2014
- **Time Range**: Approximately 11:30 UT to 12:10 UT on January 28th, 2014.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “UT Time, 28 Jan 2014 … 11:30 … 11:50 … 12:10” (from Figure 1, which indicates the timeline for the composite dynamic spectrum).
- **Wavelength(s)**: 14–0.1 MHz.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “covering 14–0.1 MHz” (from text describing the WIND/WAVES receivers).
