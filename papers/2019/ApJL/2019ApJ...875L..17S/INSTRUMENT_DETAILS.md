## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a method to constrain the parameters of a Gibson–Low flux-rope model of a coronal mass ejection (CME) using various remote observations. The study uses multiple observational instruments—white-light coronagraph images from STEREO A & B and SOHO, EUV images from SDO-AIA at 193 Å, and magnetograms from SDO-HMI—to derive key CME properties including speed, orientation, and poloidal flux. These observations, made on 7 March 2011, are integral to matching the simulated CME with the observed one. Different instruments provide complementary information ranging from viewing the CME structure and brightness, through white-light imaging that enables 3D geometry fitting, to magnetic field measurements for calculating the reconnected (and hence poloidal) flux.

### 1. STEREO A & B Coronagraphs
- **General Comments**:
   - These instruments provided multi-viewpoint white-light coronagraph images that were crucial for visually fitting the CME using the Graduate Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. They allowed determination of the CME’s height-time evolution, true speed, and orientation.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "The observed CME shows up in the STEREO A & B Cor2 coronagraph FOV at 14:54 UT."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Appearance in Coronagraph FOV
- **Time Range**: 14:54 UT on 7 March 2011 – 14:54 UT on 7 March 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The observed CME shows up in the STEREO A & B Cor2 coronagraph FOV at 14:54 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light observed with coronagraph optics)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "multi-viewpoint white-light coronagraph images."
- **Physical Observable**: CME structure (height, speed, orientation), used for obtaining the CME height-time dependence and subsequent speed estimation via linear fitting.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "By ﬁtting the CME properties with the GCS model for a series of observational time frames, we can obtain the CME height-time dependence and calculate its speed by linear ﬁtting."
- **Additional Comments**: The images from STEREO A & B were used as one part of a triad (with SOHO images) to accurately model the three-dimensional geometry of the CME.

### 2. SOHO Coronagraphs
- **General Comments**:
   - The SOHO coronagraphs, including data catalogued in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog, were used as part of a multi-viewpoint approach to observe the CME. These images complement those from STEREO A & B, and are also used for cross-checking the CME mass estimates.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "These properties can be estimated by using the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) A & B coronagraphs, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) coronagraphs..."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Imaging for Multi-viewpoint Analysis and Mass Estimation
- **Time Range**: (Not explicitly provided; observations are implicitly concurrent with the STEREO measurements on 7 March 2011, after full emergence from behind the occulter.)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We use the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list)." 
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light observed with coronagraph optics)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Referenced indirectly through the description "white-light coronagraph images."
- **Physical Observable**: CME brightness (used for estimating CME mass) and structure; aids in determining global CME properties.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We use CME brightness in Cor2 coronagraphs of STEREO A & B to estimate the mass of the CME" (the SOHO data are cross-referenced through the LASCO CME catalog).
- **Additional Comments**: Although no explicit start and end times are provided for the SOHO observations, the data are assumed to be contemporaneous with the overall CME event observed on 7 March 2011, and are critical for mass estimates.

### 3. SDO-AIA 193 Imager
- **General Comments**:
   - The SDO-AIA instrument provided high-resolution EUV images at 193 Å. In this paper, it was used to capture the post-eruption arcade, a key feature for determining the reconnected magnetic flux that contributes to the CME’s poloidal flux.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 2: (left) Post eruption arcade as seen in SDO AIA 193 imager at 16:21 UT."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Post-Eruption Arcade Observation
- **Time Range**: 16:21 UT on 7 March 2011 – 16:21 UT on 7 March 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Post eruption arcade as seen in SDO AIA 193 imager at 16:21 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å (Extreme Ultraviolet)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SDO-AIA data in 193 ˚A"
- **Physical Observable**: EUV brightness of the post-eruption arcade, which delineates the reconnected magnetic field area used for estimating the CME’s poloidal flux.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the reconnected magnetic ﬂux in the area covered by the post eruption arcade is used to estimate the poloidal ﬂux in the CME flux rope."
- **Additional Comments**: The high-resolution EUV images provide key constraints on the magnetic reconnection processes associated with the CME eruption.

### 4. SDO-HMI Magnetographs
- **General Comments**:
   - The SDO-HMI instrument provided complementary magnetic field measurements. Two types of HMI data are used: synoptic radial magnetograms for constructing the background solar corona and line-of-sight magnetograms for estimating the reconnected (and hence poloidal) flux from the source active region.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "SDO HMI synoptic radial magnetogram data" is used to drive the solar corona model.
   - "the same area is used in pre-eruption SDO HMI line-of-sight magnetogram at 13:00 UT to ﬁnd reconnected ﬂux."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Synoptic Radial Magnetogram for Corona Modeling
- **Time Range**: (No specific UT time provided; data corresponds to Carrington Rotation 2107, used at the inner boundary of the corona simulation.)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we use SDO HMI synoptic radial magnetogram for CR 2107 at the inner boundary located at the lower corona."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetogram based on magnetic field measurements in the photosphere)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "SDO HMI synoptic radial magnetogram data."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric radial magnetic field; serves as the boundary condition for generating the background solar wind solution.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "derived from the HMI line-of-sight magnetogram data" and "synoptic radial magnetogram."
- **Additional Comments**: This data underpins the global MHD model of the corona and is essential for correctly simulating the background solar wind environment.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Pre-Eruption Line-of-Sight Magnetogram for Poloidal Flux Estimation
- **Time Range**: 13:00 UT on 7 March 2011 – 13:00 UT on 7 March 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the same area is used in pre-eruption SDO HMI line-of-sight magnetogram at 13:00 UT to ﬁnd reconnected ﬂux."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetogram)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "pre-eruption SDO HMI line-of-sight magnetogram."
- **Physical Observable**: The photospheric magnetic field used to calculate the unsigned (reconnected) magnetic flux in the area beneath the post-eruption arcade, which is assumed to be approximately equal to the CME’s poloidal flux.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The reconnected ﬂux has been shown to be approximately equal to the poloidal ﬂux of a CME by Qiu et al. [2007]."
- **Additional Comments**: The close-to-disk-center positioning of the active region (within about 30° of disk center) ensures high accuracy in the magnetic field measurements used for flux estimation.
