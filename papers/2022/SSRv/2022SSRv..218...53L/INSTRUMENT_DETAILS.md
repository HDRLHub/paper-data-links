## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper reviews observations of the solar F-corona from space, emphasizing 25 years of continuous monitoring by the LASCO-C2 and C3 coronagraphs. It includes images from the Clementine spacecraft, the SECCHI/HI-1A heliospheric imager on STEREO-A, and the Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe on the Parker Solar Probe. The study connects these observations to the zodiacal light based on data from missions like Helios, IRAS, COBE, and IRAKI. The paper discusses the radiance profiles of the F-corona, its connection to the zodiacal light, and the detection of a secular variation in the F-corona's radiance. It also addresses the geometric properties, plane of symmetry, and stability of the F-corona, concluding with a discussion on the implications for interplanetary dust.
