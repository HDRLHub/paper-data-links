## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the chromospheric response during precursor and main phases of a B6.4 solar flare that occurred on August 20, 2005 (SOL2005-08-20T08:09) in Active Region 10798. The study focuses on spatio-temporal phenomena observed via multi-wavelength data, primarily using spectra-images in the Hα line captured by the MSDP imaging spectrograph at Białków Observatory and space-based X-ray and EUV observations from RHESSI and SOHO/EIT, respectively. The data analyzed covers approximately 06:00 UT to 09:00 UT. The findings are based on direct analysis of these datasets, involving time-resolved spectral fitting and imagery to diagnose plasma conditions, energy release, and chromospheric dynamics associated with the solar flare.

## Instrumentation Details

### Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass (MSDP) Imaging Spectrograph on board Large Coronagraph at Białków Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - Instrumentation consists of the Large Coronagraph equipped with the MSDP imaging spectrograph at the Białków Observatory (University of Wroclaw). The MSDP yielded two-dimensional images convolved with the Hα line spectra, enabling high-cadence and high-resolution monitoring of flare-related chromospheric dynamics. The data provides full Hα line profiles for each pixel over the field of view and is used to analyze the chromospheric response, ribbon morphology, and energy content during the flare.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Spectra-images of the investigated ﬂare (i.e. two-dimensional images convolved with the Hα line spectra; see Mein (1977) for details) have been collected with the Large Coronagraph (Gnevyshev et al. 1967; Rompolt & Rudawy 1985) equipped with the Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass (MSDP) imaging spectrograph (Mein 1991; Rompolt 1990) at the Bialkow Observatory of the University of Wroclaw, Poland."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coverage of Precursor and Main Phases of Flare SOL2005-08-20T08:09
- **Time Range**: 2005-08-20 06:36 UT – 2005-08-20 09:00 UT (with bad weather gap between 07:10 UT – 07:25 UT)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In the present investigation, we analyze MSDP observations recorded during 06:36 UT - 09:00 UT, covering various phases of the ﬂare. However, bad weather conditions during 07:10 UT - 07:25 UT led to a gap in the observations for this duration."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Hα line, from line center to ±1.2 Å (in 0.06 Å increments for each channel; nine channels plus up to thirteen quasi-monochromatic images per scan)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For each scan we constructed a set of thirteen narrow-band nearly monochromatic images of the whole region (up to ± 1.2 ˚A from the Hα line center), as well as the Hα line proﬁle at each pixel in the ﬁeld of view."
- **Physical Observable**: Chromospheric two-dimensional imaging and spectroscopy; Hα line profiles (intensity, line width, Doppler shifts, asymmetry) covering flare ribbons and quiet Sun; spatially and temporally resolved emission relevant to precursor and main flare phases.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The quasi-monochromatic images reconstructed using MSDP data in the Hα ± 1.2˚A wavelength band have been analyzed to study the chromospheric response during various phases of the ﬂare."
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument sampled at ~2.8 s exposure intervals, compiling scans of 15–18 images to cover the accessible field of view; calibration was performed against the DAVID (1961) quiet-Sun spectrum.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The time interval between two consecutive exposures has been nearly 2.8 s, the eﬀective time step between consecutive scans varied between 55 s and 68 s, depending upon the change in observing parameters."

### Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
- **General Comments**:
  - RHESSI data is central for analyzing X-ray emission from the flare, providing temporal, spatial, and spectral diagnostics in the 3 keV – 20 MeV range with high cadence and resolution. RHESSI spectra are fitted to extract key plasma properties (temperature, emission measure, non-thermal electron beam parameters) for both flare phases.
- **Supporting Quote**: "X-ray emission recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. (2002)) during the ﬂare is analyzed to deduce the spatial, temporal and spectral evolution of X-ray source."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Precursor and Main Flare Phases for SOL2005-08-20T08:09 (including spectral and image analysis)
- **Time Range**: 2005-08-20 06:00 UT – 2005-08-20 08:27 UT (data gap 06:45–07:29 UT due to RHESSI night)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In case of the analysed ﬂare RHESSI recorded the X-ray counts in the ‘A1’ attenuator state over the entire ﬂare. Due to RHESSI night, a data gap occurred between 06:45 - 07:29 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: X-ray photon energies, 3 keV – 20 MeV (emphasis in this study on 6–25 keV, with spectra and images in 6-10, 10-12, 10-15, 12-15, 14-25, 15–20, and 15–35 keV bands)

- **Physical Observable**: Spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved X-ray emission (photon flux, spectra, imaging) diagnosing thermal plasma (temperature, emission measure) and non-thermal electron beams (flux, power-law index, cutoff energy); analysis of flare source morphology and flux evolution in several energy bands.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Thermal and non-thermal characteristics of the ﬂare plasma are diagnosed by investigating the X-ray emission recorded by RHESSI mission. For this, ﬁrstly we prepare X-ray spectra with a non-uniform temporal and energy binning in order to achieve suﬃciently enough count statistics during various phases of the ﬂare."
- **Additional Comments**: Spectral fits use SPEX/OSPEX in SolarSoft, employing isothermal and thick-target bremsstrahlung components to extract physical parameters.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "As the X-ray emission originating from the coronal plasma is an aggregated response of thermal and non-thermal processes, we perform a forward-ﬁt of the background-subtracted RHESSI observations with a theoretical spectrum prepared by combining the iso-thermal (v th.pro) and thick-target bremsstrahlung models (v thick2.pro) available within the SPectral EXecutive (SPEX) package of SolarSoft1 (Awasthi et al. 2016)."

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/MDI is used to provide high-cadence (1-minute) photospheric magnetograms, supporting analysis of magnetic flux evolution during the flare; both full-disk continuum and LOS magnetic field data are used to determine the magnetic context of chromospheric and coronal activity.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetograms obtained from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI; Scherrer et al. (1995)) instrument on-board SOHO mission have been applied. As the SOHO/MDI magnetograms with a high time cadence of one minute were available only until 08:00:00 UT, evolution of magnetic-ﬁeld parameters has only been comprehensively studied during the precursor phase of the ﬂare."

- **Additional Comments**: Used primarily to establish magnetic connectivity and for referencing positions within the flare region.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We have used Meudon spectroheliograph full-disk observations obtained at 06:20:16 UT as a reference to derive actual Solar X-Y coordinates of high-resolution MSDP observations. Additionally, SOHO/MDI full-disk photospheric continuum observation, recorded at 06:24:00 UT, is used for cross-checking the alignment."
