## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a self-consistent paradigm to explain the multiwavelength observations of the nearby low‐luminosity GRB 190829A. The authors analyze the prompt gamma-ray lightcurve—characterized by two distinct pulses—and the broadband afterglow emission in the radio, optical, X‐ray, and very high energy (VHE) gamma‐ray bands. Data from several space‐ and ground‐based instruments are employed to constrain the jet properties, the ambient medium (including an e±-rich shell produced via γγ annihilation), and the physical processes (synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-Compton [SSC]) driving the afterglow emissions. Observations span from the prompt emission phase (seconds after the trigger) to very late times (up to hundreds of days post-trigger), providing insight into the GRB's environment and making predictions on the detectability of its VHE component with current telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, CTA) while also discussing non-detections with LHAASO.
