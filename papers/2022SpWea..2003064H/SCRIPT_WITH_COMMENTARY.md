This script constructs queries for the MDI, EIT, and LASCO instruments based on the specific details provided in the context. The queries are tailored to the time ranges and wavelengths relevant to each instrument's role in the study. The results of these queries are printed, and the data download commands are commented out, adhering to the directive not to execute data retrieval within the script. This approach ensures that the script is focused and aligned with the requirements of the study as described.
