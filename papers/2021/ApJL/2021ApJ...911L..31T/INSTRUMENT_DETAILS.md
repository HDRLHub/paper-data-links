# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study presents a detailed analysis of multipoint observations of a fast magnetosonic shock reformation event that occurred upstream of Earth’s bow shock on 30 Jan 2019. Utilizing data from NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, the paper examines shock dynamics on both ion‐ and electron-kinetic scales as the shock evolves and reforms. The investigation leverages measurements of magnetic fields, plasma distributions, and electric fields to convert time series data into spatial scales along the shock normal. Key dates and times in UT – for example, intervals near 04:38–04:39 UT – mark transitions in the shock’s structure, with different MMS spacecraft (MMS-1 to MMS-4) observing unique aspects of the evolving “new shock ramp” and associated wave phenomena. These observations are critical to understanding the cross-scale coupling and energy dissipation processes in collisionless shocks.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Fluxgate Magnetometer on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The fluxgate magnetometers onboard the MMS spacecraft measured the vector and magnitude of the magnetic field. These instruments were crucial in revealing distinct B-field structures in the foreshock transient and in tracking both the original shock ramp and the formation of the “new shock ramp” during the reformation cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Panels a) – g) show data from MMS-1, highlighting the foreshock transient... Figure 1h) – k) shows magnetic fields observed by all four MMS spacecraft between 04:39:15 and 04:39:33 UT."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Foreshock Transient and Initial Shock Ramp Observation
- **Time Range**: Approximately 04:39:15 UT to 04:39:33 UT (30 Jan 2019)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Figure 1h) – k) shows magnetic fields observed by all four MMS spacecraft between 04:39:15 and 04:39:33 UT."
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field vector and magnitude (|B|)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Panels a) – g) show data from the foreshock transient observed by MMS-1... including: a) magnetic field vector in GSE coordinates and magnitude."

#### Additional Comments
- This instrument provided the baseline for identifying key features such as the “foot”, the original shock ramp (S ~ 0 km), and the emerging new shock ramp. The magnetic field measurements also enabled estimation of shock normals and growth rates.

### 2. Search-Coil Magnetometer on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The search-coil magnetometer is employed to capture high-frequency magnetic field fluctuations. It is sensitive to the electromagnetic waves and whistler-mode signals (e.g., lion roars) present both upstream and downstream of the shock ramp.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 3c) and i) show high-frequency Bwave from the search-coil magnetometer data in GSE coordinates... MMS-3 observed lion roars with amplitudes < 100 pT (e.g., around 04:39:20.8 UT in Fig. 3c), while MMS-2 observed lion roars at amplitudes > 500 pT (e.g., around 04:39:25.1 UT in Fig. 3i)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Electromagnetic Wave Observations during Shock Reformation
- **Time Range**: Observations centered around 04:39 UT, with specific events noted at ~04:39:20.8 UT (MMS-3) and ~04:39:25.1 UT (MMS-2)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "MMS-3 observed lion roars with amplitudes < 100 pT (e.g., around 04:39:20.8 UT in Fig. 3c), while MMS-2 observed lion roars at amplitudes > 500 pT (e.g., around 04:39:25.1 UT in Fig. 3i)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: The electromagnetic fluctuations, particularly whistler mode waves, exhibited wavelengths on the order of ~460 km along the shock normal (as inferred from the lion roar measurements) and were associated with corresponding electron-scale electrostatic fluctuations.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "In the shock frame, those ESWs had wavelengths on the order of 100 – 120 m along S, approximately one quarter of the lion roars’ wavelengths at ~460 m along S."
- **Physical Observable**: High-frequency magnetic field fluctuations associated with whistler-mode waves and lion roars.

#### Additional Comments
- The information from the search-coil magnetometer complements the fluxgate data by resolving the fine structure of the electromagnetic waves that are involved in the energy dissipation at electron scales.

### 3. Ion and Electron Plasma Instrument (Fast Plasma Investigation) on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - This suite of instruments measures ion and electron plasma distributions and moments. Such measurements are essential for interpreting the plasma dynamics across the shock and documenting features such as ion velocity deflections and gyromotion.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Panels a) – g) show data from the foreshock transient observed by MMS-1, including... d) ion velocity vector in GSE coordinates and magnitude... the deflection of ion velocity between 04:38:45 and 04:39:28 UT in Fig. 1d."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Ion Velocity and Plasma Moment Observations during Shock Crossing
- **Time Range**: Approximately 04:38:45 UT to 04:39:28 UT (30 Jan 2019)

   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "ion and electron plasma distributions and moments [Pollock et al., 2016]."

#### Additional Comments
- The plasma instrument data were used in conjunction with the magnetic field data to determine the orientation, shock speed, and spatiotemporal evolution of features such as the new shock ramp and the reflected ion populations.

### 4. Electric Field Instrument (Axial and Spin-Plane Double Probe) on board MMS
- **General Comments**:
   - The electric field instruments, consisting of axial and spin-plane double probes, captured high-frequency E-wave data, including large-amplitude electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) and other electrical field fluctuations that are indicative of electron-scale processes.
- **Supporting Quote**:

#### Data Collection Period 1: High-Frequency E-Wave Observations during Shock Reformation
- **Time Range**: Occurred concurrently with the magnetic field and plasma observations around 04:39 UT (with specific examples provided in the context for downstream regions during the new ramp formation)
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Strong broadband electrostatic fluctuations, corresponding to electron-scale nonlinear waves/structures, were observed by all four spacecraft... (noting examples near the shock ramp around 04:39 UT)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: The ESWs exhibited very short wavelengths, on the order of 80–120 m along the shock normal.
   - **Supporting Quote**:

#### Additional Comments
- The electric field measurements helped in revealing the fine-scale structure of the shock transition, including the interplay between electrostatic and electromagnetic processes during the shock front reformation.
