## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses a new method for measuring the frequency of maximum oscillation power (𝜀�max) in asteroseismology, specifically applied to 16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants. This method does not require fitting to the granulation background, which is common in other approaches. Instead, it involves dividing the power spectrum by a function of the form 𝜀�−2 to remove the slope due to granulation background, followed by smoothing to measure 𝜀�max. The method is described as fast, simple, and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting, providing a systematic offset of 1.5% in 𝜀�max values that can be calibrated. The paper also compares seismic radii derived from this method with those from Gaia, noting similar trends to previous studies. The method is effective for stars with low 𝜀�max (0.19–18.35 𝜀�Hz) and can identify oscillations correctly.

## Instrumentation Details

### Kepler Space Telescope
- **General Comments**:
   - The Kepler Space Telescope was utilized to collect photometric data from red giants, which was then analyzed using the newly developed method to measure 𝜀�max without fitting the granulation background.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement of 𝜀�max for red giants
- **Time Range**: Data from the entire Kepler mission, specific dates not provided but Kepler operated from 2009 to 2013.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified, but Kepler's photometer measures light in a broad visual bandpass.
- **Physical Observable**: Photometric brightness variations used to derive power spectra for asteroseismology.
- **Additional Comments**: The method was applied to a large sample of 16,000 red giants, demonstrating its effectiveness across a wide range of stellar properties.

### VIRGO Instrument on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The VIRGO instrument on the SOHO spacecraft was used to validate the method by applying it to solar data, providing a reference 𝜀�max for the Sun.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar data analysis for method validation
- **Time Range**: Specific dates not provided, but the analysis likely includes data spanning multiple years since VIRGO has been operational since 1996.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Observations from VIRGO's three channels at 862 nm (Red), 500 nm (Green), and 402 nm (Blue).
- **Physical Observable**: Solar photometric brightness as measured in different wavelength channels.
- **Additional Comments**: The method's application to solar data helps in calibrating the 𝜀�max measurements by providing a benchmark comparison with established solar values.
