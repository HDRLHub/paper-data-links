## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the transverse coronal-loop oscillations induced by the eruption of a prominence-carrying flux rope on 7 December 2012. The flux rope originated from NOAA Active Region (AR) 11621 and was observed in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft and in Hα line center by the ground-based telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The study focuses on the early evolution of the flux rope, which is divided into a slow rise phase and a fast rise phase, and the subsequent generation of a C5.8 flare. The paper also examines the oscillations of nearby coronal loops in both horizontal and vertical directions, using data from multiple instruments to analyze the physical parameters and implications of these oscillations.
