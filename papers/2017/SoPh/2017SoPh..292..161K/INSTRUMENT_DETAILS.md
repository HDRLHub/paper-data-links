## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The study presents independent estimates of the magnetic field strength (B) in the solar corona during a coronal mass ejection (CME) event on 23 July 2016. The estimates derive from two primary observational sources: radio observations of a split-band type II burst and whitelight coronagraph images of the CME, both occurring contemporaneously. Data for the radio analysis were gathered using the Gauribidanur RAdio SpectroPolarimeter (GRASP), with supporting frequency constraints from the Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS) and e-CALLISTO, all located at the Gauribidanur observatory in India. Whitelight observations and polarized brightness (pB) measurements were obtained from the SOHO/LASCO-C2 and STEREO-A/COR1 coronagraphs. These instruments provided synchronous data during the CME eruption and the radio burst, specifically between ≈05:00–06:12 UT on 23 July 2016, covering heliocentric distances from approximately 1.5 to 5.5 solar radii. The derived data were used directly in the analysis for electron density estimation, shock speed, and magnetic field calculation. No interpretive density models were assumed; instead, models were constructed using actual pB measurements relevant to the event.
