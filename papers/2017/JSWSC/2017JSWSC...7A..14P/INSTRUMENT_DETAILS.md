## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper presents a comprehensive catalogue of solar energetic particle (SEP) events characterized by 55–80 MeV protons observed near Earth, covering the entire span of solar cycle 23 (1996–2008) and the majority of solar cycle 24 (2009–2016). The primary data source underpinning the results is the SOHO/ERNE experiment, with additional corroborative data used from ACE/EPAM (near-relativistic electrons), SOHO/EPHIN (relativistic electrons), SOHO/LASCO (CME observations), and GOES X-ray sensors. The catalogue includes 176 SEP events, for which precise onset and end times, as well as proton and electron release times, were estimated using both velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time-shifting analysis (TSA). The paper also incorporates associations with CME and X-ray events by direct analysis of LASCO and GOES data, respectively. Specific observation periods are May 1996 through December 2016, with data selection, onset/end estimation, and statistical evaluation all based on these datasets.

### ERNE (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron Experiment) on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - Main provider of high-energy proton data (1.58–131 MeV across LED and HED detectors) and sole source for 55–80 MeV proton event detection and characterization, serving as the foundation for the SEP event catalogue and all event timing analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The ERNE experiment (Torsti et al. 1995) aboard the SOHO spacecraft served as the primary instrument in this study. ERNE consists of two particle telescopes, the Low-Energy Detector (LED) and the High-Energy Detector (HED)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Proton event search and characterization
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, for all SEP event identification  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "To identify the SEP events that had occurred during the time of interest, we scanned visually through SOHO/ERNE intensity data collected during the period between May 1996 and December 2016."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (proton energy channels, not EM wavelengths)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "ERNE covers the nominal energy range of some 1 MeV/nucleon to a few hundred MeV/nucleon for ions. For protons and helium ions, the upper limit of the energy range is about 140 MeV/nucleon."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities (SEP event detection, onset/end time determination, VDA analysis), oxygen and iron event fluence, Fe/O ratio  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For protons, the energy range of interest was from ∼10 MeV to 140 MeV (prior to 19 April 2000) or 131 MeV (after 19 April 2000)... The proton event onset times as observed by SOHO/ERNE were determined using the so-called Poisson-CUSUM method."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Detailed timing and spectral analysis (VDA)
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, event-by-event for each catalogue entry
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The VDA was performed using 20 proton energy channels, spanning the range 1.58 MeV to 131 MeV (see Table 2). Of this, LED covers the energies between 1.58 MeV and 12.7 MeV, while HED covers those between 13.8 MeV and 131 MeV, both providing ten individual channels."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (specified energy channels instead)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "proton energy channel of 54.8–80.3 MeV (average energy 67.7 MeV) was chosen as the principal channel to be investigated."
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities in specified energy channels for VDA path length and release time estimation
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The observed event onset time is known, the velocity dispersion analysis for a given particle species and kinetic energy E can be performed."

#### Data Collection Period 3: Event ending/intensity decay
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, for every event’s end-time as defined in method  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In our study, an SEP event is deﬁned as having ended when the intensity of protons in the 12.6–13.8 MeV (average 13.3 MeV) energy channel falls below twice that of the pre-event background... for the ﬁrst time."
- **Physical Observable**: Event-level SEP time profiles and termination in the low-energy range
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Observing the onset and end in diﬀerent energy channels is justiﬁed by the fact that in a typical event, after the most energetic particles have already arrived... considerable numbers of slower, less energetic particles are still on the way."

### EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor) on board ACE

- **General Comments**:
  - Used for near-relativistic electron event detection/characterization (primarily 0.18–0.31 MeV electrons), providing key cross-identification and timing of electron SEP event counterparts.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "In addition to proton data, we examined electron intensity data recorded by both ACE/EPAM (near-relativistic electrons)... These were analysed for onset times, and ACE/EPAM data additionally for maximum intensities during the events as well as particle release times, so as to form a more complete picture of each event than would be possible by relying on proton data alone."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Electron event detection and timing
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, coincident with ERNE event catalogue  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "By default, the ACE/EPAM data... used in our analysis were sectored one-minute intensities observed by the LEFS60 (Low-Energy Foil Spectrometer) telescope."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (electron kinetic energy channels)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The principal ACE/EPAM energy channel used for determining the onsets was 0.18–0.31 MeV. However, in five cases (events 1, 10, 41, 118, and 141) it was deemed necessary to resort to the 0.10–0.18 MeV energy channel so as to obtain a clear result..."
- **Physical Observable**: Electron intensities (near-relativistic, onset timing, maximum intensity)  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The principal ACE/EPAM energy channel used for determining the onsets was 0.18–0.31 MeV. ... The energy ranges correspond to mean electron energies of 0.23 MeV and 0.13 MeV and thus mean speeds of 0.73 c and 0.61 c, respectively."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Release time estimation (TSA for electrons)
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, per event as in main catalogue  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the onset times were determined for each event and, after discarding cases where no reasonable result for tonset could be obtained, only TSA was performed."

### GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) Soft X-ray sensors

- **General Comments**:
  - Utilized for cataloguing and timing of soft X-ray flares, providing flare magnitude, class, start/end time, and their association with SEP events for timing/causal analyses.
- **Supporting Quote**:

The electromagnetic (EM) wavelength band of interest was 0.1–0.8 nm, i.e. soft X-rays."

#### Data Collection Period: Flare detection and association with SEPs
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, coincident with catalogue period  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The electromagnetic (EM) wavelength band of interest was 0.1–0.8 nm, i.e. soft X-rays. However, only flares with NOAA/GOES magnitude classification of C1.0 or greater (peak flux at least 10-6 W/m2) were taken into consideration."

### SWEPAM (Solar Wind Electron Proton and Alpha Monitor) on board ACE and SWE on Wind

- **General Comments**:
  - Used for solar wind speed measurements, required for computing Parker spiral connection and field lengths critical for TSA calculations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The solar wind speed, relevant to the calculation of z(r), was determined using data from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) aboard ACE ... with Wind/SWE data ... substituted for the events for which the former were not available."

#### Data Collection Period: Solar wind speed for field-line computations
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – December 2016, for each SEP event  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In each case the data were averaged over a 12-hour period, centered on tonset for 54.8–80.3 MeV protons observed by ERNE; in cases where the precise tonset for protons was unknown but known for electrons, the UT calendar day (24 hours) during which the onset had most likely occurred was used to obtain L for electron TSA."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind proton speed (km/s), for Parker spiral path calculation
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The solar wind speed, relevant to the calculation of z(r), was determined using data from the Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) aboard ACE ... with Wind/SWE data ... substituted for the events for which the former were not available."
