## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper identifies and analyzes solar energetic particle (SEP) events with protons accelerated to energies above 500 MeV, using data from the Electron Proton Helium Instrument (EPHIN) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) for the period 1995–2015. The EPHIN instrument’s data, extended to energies up to 1 GeV via a validated analysis method, forms the exclusive basis for the identification of 42 SEP events, their onset time determination, and spectral analysis. All research results—including the event list, statistical studies, and spectral fits—rely directly on SOHO/EPHIN measurements collected throughout this 20-year period. Physical observables include high-energy proton intensities and energy spectra, particularly within the 500–700 MeV range, derived and processed from the EPHIN detector stack data.

## Instrumentation Details

### Electron Proton Helium INstrument (EPHIN) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The EPHIN instrument provides the sole direct observational data for this research, delivering high-energy proton measurements. Its data enables both the identification and spectral analysis of the studied SEP events during 1995–2015.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "In this work, SEP events with protons accelerated to above 500 MeV have been identiﬁed using data from the Electron Proton Helium Instrument (EPHIN) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) between 1995 and 2015."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full-mission search and event identification
- **Time Range**: 1995-12-01 – 2015-10-01 (entirely covering SOHO/EPHIN operational data, with noted data gap in 1998)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Using this identiﬁcation technique, 42 solar particle events in the time between start of the mission (December 1995) and 1 October 2015 have been identiﬁed."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies only; measurement focuses on proton energies, not electromagnetic wavelengths)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The nominal energy range between 5 and 50 MeV for protons was extended to energies from 100 MeV to above 1 GeV with a method ﬁrst presented by K¨uhl et al. (2015b)."
- **Physical Observable**: Hourly-averaged proton intensities in the range 500–700 MeV, and broader SEP event proton spectra
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In order to identify SEPs with protons accelerated to energies above 500 MeV, a histogram of hourly intensities in a deﬁned 500 – 700 MeV range from 1995 to 2015 is presented in Figure 3."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The search algorithm and statistical analysis were entirely based on SOHO/EPHIN particle count and derived proton energy spectra.
  - Data gap: "It has to be noted that communication with SOHO was lost for several months during 1998 and, hence, no EPHIN data is available for this time period."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Event-by-event spectral analysis
- **Time Range**: Individual SEP event intervals within 1995-12-01 – 2015-10-01, with focus on two-hour intervals beginning 30 minutes after each determined event onset
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "For the remaining 33 events, the high energy proton spectrum has been calculated in a time interval of two hours starting 30 minutes after the onset."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (proton energies up to >1 GeV; analysis focused on energies between 100 MeV and 800 MeV)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Since we only analyze energies above 100 MeV, a single power law function... has been ﬁtted for every single event. Based on the approximation of the electron contribution described above (c.f. Figure 2), only energies below 800 MeV have been taken into account for the ﬁt due to possible electron contamination at higher energies."
- **Physical Observable**: Differential proton energy spectra derived from detector signal, specifically for penetrating protons between 100 MeV and 800 MeV
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The method is based on particles that penetrate the entire detector stack, depositing only a fraction of their kinetic energy in the instrument. For these penetrating particles, the energy deposition in the detectors C and D are taken as measurement of the energy losses of these particles. The energy losses can then be converted back to total kinetic energy with an uncertainty between 10 % (at 100 MeV) and 20 % (at 1 GeV, c.f. ﬁgure 9 in K¨uhl et al., 2015b)."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Subdivision into events and requirement for sufficient statistical counts to derive spectral indices and fluxes at 500 MeV.  
  - Intensity and spectral slope measurements underpin all key results—see Table 3 for event-by-event results entirely based on EPHIN data.
