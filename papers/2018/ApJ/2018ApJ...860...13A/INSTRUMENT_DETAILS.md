## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the effect of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (ECMEs) on the Sun’s shadow as observed in the 3 TeV galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) intensity. Using data from different air shower arrays (Tibet-I, Tibet-II, and Tibet-III) along with detailed Monte Carlo simulations based on potential field models (CSSS models) of the coronal magnetic field, the authors compare observations with simulations over a solar cycle. The analysis focuses on the period from 2000 to 2009, examining the solar-cycle variation and the specific impacts during ECME transit periods. Additional magnetic field observations from solar instruments (e.g., SOHO/LASCO, National Solar Observatory spectromagnetograph at Kitt Peak, MDI, GONG, and SOLIS/KPVT) are used in modeling the solar magnetic field and verifying the influence on cosmic ray deflections.
