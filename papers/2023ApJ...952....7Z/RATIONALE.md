produce the script. We need to construct queries for the LASCO instrument on SOHO and the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on STEREO-A and STEREO-B. These instruments were used to observe CMEs between 2010 and 2013. The specific dates are not provided, so we will use the entire period from 2010 to 2013 for our queries. The physical observables mentioned include radial size, expansion speed, and dimensionless expansion parameters, but these are derived from the data and not directly queried. Therefore, our queries will focus on the instruments and the time range.
