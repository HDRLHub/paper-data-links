## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the solar source regions of impulsive (3He-rich) solar energetic particle (SEP) events with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectroscopic observations, specifically targeting four recurrent jet events from the 3He-rich SEP event list of solar cycle 23. The core analysis focuses on event 2 (2002 August 19), for which comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage was available. Data forming the basis for the results were obtained from the SOHO CDS (Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer) NIS slit spectrometer, observing key EUV lines; supporting imaging was acquired from SOHO EIT and TRACE; photospheric context was added from SOHO MDI; in situ ion and electron measurements were sourced from SOHO EPHIN (for SEPs), with confirming radio signatures from Wind WAVES, Phoenix-2, and HXR and soft X-ray observations from Wind KONUS and GOES XRS. Detailed temporal specification ensures correlation between remote-sensing and in situ events, with all observation dates, times, and instrument-usage contexts specified exactly as utilized in the research.
