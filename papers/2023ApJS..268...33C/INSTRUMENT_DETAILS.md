## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the homogenization of solar images from two different surveys, SoHO/EIT and SDO/AIA, both at 171 Å wavelengths, using deep learning techniques. The study spans over the period from 2010 to 2020, focusing on creating a homogeneous dataset of EUV images for better long-term solar studies. The approach involves using an ensemble of deep learning models trained on the temporal overlap of these two surveys to predict and estimate uncertainties in solar imaging, which is crucial for space weather prediction. The paper emphasizes the improvement of model predictions with increased training data size and highlights the potential of model ensembles in handling data scarcity and enhancing prediction reliability.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - EIT is used to capture full-disc solar images at 171 Å, which are crucial for studying the solar atmosphere and solar corona. The instrument's data, when combined with SDO/AIA, helps in creating a homogeneous dataset for enhanced solar studies.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full-disc solar imaging for homogenization study
- **Time Range**: 2010-2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Solar extreme ultraviolet emission
- **Additional Comments**: Images from EIT were used in conjunction with SDO/AIA to train deep learning models for creating a homogeneous dataset.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides detailed full-disc images of the sun at 171 Å, which are used to study the solar atmosphere and solar corona. The high resolution and dynamic range of AIA complement the EIT data in the homogenization process.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full-disc solar imaging for homogenization study
- **Time Range**: 2010-2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å
- **Physical Observable**: Solar extreme ultraviolet emission
- **Additional Comments**: AIA images are reprojected to match the EIT detector's point-of-view for accurate homogenization and analysis in the deep learning framework.
