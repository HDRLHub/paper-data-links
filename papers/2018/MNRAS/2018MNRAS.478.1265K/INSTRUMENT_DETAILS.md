## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents the detection and analysis of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spallation events observed with instruments onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO). The study focuses on the unique capability of space‐borne CCD imaging to record cosmic ray impacts outside the Earth’s magnetosphere. A particularly striking event was recorded at 11:30 UT on 29 November 2015 using the LASCO C3 coronagraph. In addition to this unique event, the authors review decades of LASCO observations (spanning roughly 20 years) and compare imaging from additional instruments (including LASCO C2 and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, EIT). The paper describes the instrumental response (including the silicon CCD chip characteristics) to these energetic events, discusses the energy ranges derived from the analysis, and places these findings in context with ground‐based cosmic ray studies and solar energetic particle (SEP) events.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. LASCO C3 Coronagraph on board the SoHO spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C3 coronagraph is an externally occulted white-light instrument with a large 16° field-of-view. It is primarily used for observing the solar corona as well as detecting events in the space environment, including cosmic ray and spallation signatures on its CCD detector.
   - It played a central role in this study by providing the image in which a spallation event was recorded.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "Such an event was seen on Nov. 29, 2015 using a unique LASCO C3 space coronagraph routine image taken during the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) mission observing uninterruptedly at the Lagrangian L1 point." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Spallation Event on a Quiet Sun Day
- **Time Range**: 11:30 UT on 29 November 2015 – 11:30 UT on 29 November 2015  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a movie made from routinely processed C3/LASCO coronagraph observations of the SoHO mission, at 11:30 UTC of 29 Nov. 2015, a time of very low solar activity on the Sun."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (broadband visible light used for coronal imaging)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "images of the C3 externally occulted coronagraph ... that produces a 16° large field-of-view (FOV) around the Sun."
- **Physical Observable**: Cosmic ray spallation tracks (diverging linear tracks, bright dots, and pixel-width impacts on a silicon CCD)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the resulting image includes different diverging linear 'tracks' of varying intensity, leading to a single pixel; this frame identifies the site on the silicon CCD chip of the coronagraph camera."
- **Additional Comments**: This unique event is interpreted as a spallation event produced by a high-energy galactic cosmic ray interacting with the silicon chip, and it is recorded away from Earth's magnetospheric effects.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Long-Term Coronagraphic Observations
- **Time Range**: Approximately from 1996 to 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "20-Year operation of LASCO" and "selected spallation events recorded during the SoHO mission (1996 to 2017)" as seen in Figs. 4 and 5.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light, as used in standard coronagraph imaging
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LASCO coronal images" that reveal both the K-corona and the F-corona.
- **Physical Observable**: Occasional cosmic ray impacts recorded as dots and track signatures on the CCD chip, with variations related to both solar energetic particles (during flares and CMEs) and cosmic rays during quiet solar conditions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "the CCD imaging experiments using a CCD chip as a detector produced a myriad of dots and tracks on LASCO coronal images."
- **Additional Comments**: Although the focus is on one major event (29 November 2015), the continuous 20-year dataset allowed the authors to assess how the incidence rate of such events varies with the solar cycle and compare energy regimes.

### 2. LASCO C2 Coronagraph on board the SoHO spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 coronagraph is another white-light coronagraph on SoHO, offering a field-of-view complementary to that of C3. It is employed to capture solar corona images and to investigate cosmic ray and SEP induced signatures.
   - In the paper, C2 observations are used alongside C3 images to search for and compare spallation and particle impact signatures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "We repeated the search, again without success, for the recent 'double' X-type flare of Sept. 6 (disk event) and of Sept. 9 (limb event), 2017 using both the sequences from the C2 and the C3 LASCO coronagraphs of SoHO."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations During the Double X-type Flare in 2017
- **Time Range**: 6 September 2017 (disk event) and 9 September 2017 (limb event)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "for the recent 'double' X-type flare of Sept. 6 (disk event) and of Sept. 9 (limb event), 2017..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (consistent with coronagraph imaging)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implicit by the reference to "LASCO coronagraphs" which are white-light instruments.
- **Physical Observable**: Although no successful spallation 'star' signature (in the context described) was isolated during this period, these observations were used to compare track signatures possibly produced by high-energy particles.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "a spallation event see e.g. Kowalczyk (2008) ... may indeed result in a photographic emulsion" indicating that the search in these datasets was aimed at identifying similar events.
- **Additional Comments**: The C2 data served as a comparison to validate that the unique signature observed on 29 November 2015 with C3 was distinct from typical SEP tracks recorded during major flare events.

### 3. Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board the SoHO spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The EIT imager is part of the suite of SoHO's CCD imaging instruments. It is designed to capture images in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), primarily for studying the solar atmosphere at different temperatures.
   - Although not the primary instrument for detecting cosmic ray spallation events in this study, its mention highlights the broader suite of SoHO’s imaging capabilities.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The CCD imaging instruments of the SoHO mission... including the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraphs (LASCO) and the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) imagers, are sensitive to Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)..."
  
#### Data Collection Period: General Operation During SoHO Mission
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly specified in the paper for EIT; assumed to be concurrent with the overall mission duration (from launch in December 1995 to present operations as referenced).
   - **Supporting Quote**: The overall context indicates that SoHO instruments, including EIT, have been operating over the 20-year period referenced for LASCO data.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme ultraviolet wavelengths
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied by its designation "Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT)".
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emissions from the solar atmosphere (typically used for imaging solar plasma structures at million-degree temperatures)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Although not detailed in the context of cosmic ray detections, EIT’s primary role in SoHO is well known for imaging coronal and transition-region structures.
- **Additional Comments**: The mention of EIT helps underscore the capacity of SoHO’s CCD imagers to capture a range of solar phenomena, even though the focal measurements in this paper pertain to cosmic ray interactions recorded by the LASCO instruments.
