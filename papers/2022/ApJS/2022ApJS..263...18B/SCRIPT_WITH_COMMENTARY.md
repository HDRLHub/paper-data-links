# Context:
# The paper discusses the numerical nuances of global coronal models, particularly focusing on the boundary conditions and grid design to improve the accuracy and efficiency of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. The MDI instrument on SOHO was used to obtain the magnetic map data for the 2008 solar eclipse simulation. This data is crucial for prescribing the radial component of the magnetic field on the inner boundary of the domain in the MHD simulations.

# Reasoning:
# We need to construct a query to download data from the MDI instrument on SOHO for the time period around the 2008 solar eclipse. The exact time range is not provided, but we can assume a reasonable range around the date of the eclipse, which was August 1, 2008. We will query for data from July 25, 2008, to August 5, 2008, to ensure we capture the necessary data.

# Define the time range for the query
time_range = TimeRange('2008-07-25', '2008-08-05')

# Define the instrument and source
instrument = 'MDI'
source = 'SOHO'

# Construct the query
query = Fido.search(
    a.Time(time_range.start, time_range.end),
    a.Instrument(instrument),
    a.Source(source)
)

# Print out the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```
