## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper proposes a gravitational wave (GW) detection concept using asteroids in the inner Solar System as test masses (TMs). The primary objective is to evaluate the acceleration noise of asteroids in the µHz band, demonstrating that ∼10 km-diameter asteroids can serve as suitable TMs. The study suggests deploying human-engineered base stations on multiple asteroids, equipped with electromagnetic transmitters/receivers to measure variations in the distance between them. The concept includes using space-qualified optical atomic clocks for laser ranging, with potential alternatives like radio-ranging or interferometric link systems. The paper discusses various environmental perturbations and noise sources, concluding that the proposed mission could achieve significant sensitivity in the µHz GW frequency band.

## Instrumentation Details

### CELIAS/MTOF Proton Monitor on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The CELIAS/MTOF Proton Monitor provides real-time data on the solar wind's proton density and velocity, which are crucial for estimating the solar wind's impact on asteroid TMs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The protons in the solar wind are currently monitored in real time by the CELIAS/MTOF proton monitor (PM) on the SOHO satellite located at the Earth–Sun L1 Lagrange point."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General solar wind monitoring
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The CELIAS/MTOF PM supplies ∼25 yrs of data on the instantaneous (30 s sampling resolution) number density np(t) and velocity vp(t) of the proton flux in the solar wind."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (proton density and velocity measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind proton density and velocity
   - **Supporting Quote**: "These measurements show that the densities and speeds of the wind have temporal fluctuations that will give rise to an in-band noise source for our GW detection proposal, in much the same way as the fluctuating TSI."

### VIRGO Instrument on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The VIRGO instrument provides data on the total solar irradiance (TSI), which is used to estimate the impact of solar intensity fluctuations on asteroid TMs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Various fractional TSI PSDs are presented in Fig. 12 of Ref. [120]. These are based on: (1) a composite of solar intensity measurements from a variety of missions spanning 1978–2002 (PMOD composite [120]), (2) data from the VIRGO instrument on SOHO during solar maximum (Oct. 2000–Feb. 2002), and (3) data from VIRGO during solar minimum (Feb. 1996–Aug. 1997)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar maximum
- **Time Range**: October 2000 – February 2002
   - **Supporting Quote**: "data from the VIRGO instrument on SOHO during solar maximum (Oct. 2000–Feb. 2002)"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (total solar irradiance measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Total solar irradiance (TSI)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The TSI fluctuation depends mildly on the solar cycle, and its power spectral density (PSD) S[∆I⊙] has been well measured at different epochs."

#### Data Collection Period 2: Solar minimum
- **Time Range**: February 1996 – August 1997
   - **Supporting Quote**: "data from VIRGO during solar minimum (Feb. 1996–Aug. 1997)"
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (total solar irradiance measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Total solar irradiance (TSI)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The TSI fluctuation depends mildly on the solar cycle, and its power spectral density (PSD) S[∆I⊙] has been well measured at different epochs."

### ACE MAG Instrument on board ACE
- **General Comments**:
   - The ACE MAG instrument provides data on the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), which is used to estimate the impact of magnetic field fluctuations on asteroid TMs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Data spanning 1997–2021 (i.e., over slightly more than two full solar cycles) from the ACE mission indicate a very similar −5/3 power-law spectral index for f ≳3 µHz."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General HMF monitoring
- **Time Range**: 1997 – 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Data spanning 1997–2021 (i.e., over slightly more than two full solar cycles) from the ACE mission indicate a very similar −5/3 power-law spectral index for f ≳3 µHz."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Heliospheric magnetic field (HMF)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The heliospheric magnetic field will also give rise to fluctuating torquing of any permanent magnetic moment of 314159 Alice."

### LISA Pathﬁnder
- **General Comments**:
   - LISA Pathﬁnder provides data on test mass acceleration noise, which is used to benchmark the expected performance of the proposed asteroid-based GW detector.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The µAres ‘strawman mission concept’ projected strain sensitivity assumes that a TM acceleration noise amplitude spectral density (ASD) slightly exceeding the best absolute levels attained in the LISA Pathﬁnder mission around f ∼1–10 mHz can be maintained without degradation (i.e., ﬂat in frequency) down to f ∼10−7 Hz."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General mission data
- **Time Range**: 2015 – 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LISA Pathﬁnder results show a rising acceleration noise ASD below the LISA-optimized sensitivity band."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (acceleration noise measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Test mass acceleration noise
   - **Supporting Quote**: "LISA Pathﬁnder results show a rising acceleration noise ASD below the LISA-optimized sensitivity band."
