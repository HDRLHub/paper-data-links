This script is tailored to retrieve data from the EPD and STIX instruments on the Solar Orbiter for the specific event on October 9, 2021. The queries are constructed based on the exact time range of the event and the instruments involved, as specified in the context. The results from these queries will provide the necessary data for analyzing the SEP event, focusing on the energetic particle measurements and hard X-ray emissions that are crucial for understanding the electron acceleration processes during the event.
