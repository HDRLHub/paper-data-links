Explanation:
1. **MWA Query**: We construct a query for the MWA observations using the specific time range and frequencies provided. The `a.Wavelength` attribute is used to specify the frequency bands in which the observations were made. This is crucial for capturing the gyrosynchrotron emissions from the CME.

2. **STEREO-B Query**: For STEREO-B, we focus on the COR1 detector as it was used to capture the initial appearance and trajectory of the CME in visible light. The time range is adjusted to match the exact period during which the CME was observed by STEREO-B.

3. **Query Execution and Results**: The script uses `Fido.search` to execute the queries and prints the results. The actual data download commands are commented out to prevent execution without user intervention.

This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the context, ensuring that the queries are accurate and relevant to the study described in the paper.
