## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the variations in the solar wind helium abundance (denoted as Aₕₑ) observed over the last four solar cycles (cycles 21–24). Using an inter-calibrated set of 1-hour cadence measurements from the OMNI database, the authors analyze how helium abundance differs in slow and intermediate solar winds and examine its correlation with sunspot numbers (SSN) and solar wind velocity. The research utilizes data collected from multiple spacecraft spanning from 1971 to 2019, enabling a comparison between earlier cycles (when typical Aₕₑ values were near 4–5%) and cycle 24 (where the peak shifted to lower values of 2–3%). Detailed statistical analyses, including log-normal fits and delayed correlation studies, are employed to understand potential changes in coronal magnetic field configurations and their influence on solar wind helium processing.
