1. Fermi/GBM on board the Fermi spacecraft  
   - **General Comments**:  
     - Designed for detecting faint, distant astronomical sources and solar emission in hard X-rays and gamma-rays. It provided continuous low spectral resolution data at a nominal cadence of 0.256 seconds and higher spectral resolution data at 4.096 seconds.  
     - In this study the non-thermal X-ray excess in the 15–50 keV range is diagnosed using Fermi/GBM data.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     - “Due to its low-Earth circular orbit, observation of the Sun is interrupted by night periods... For this event, the peak of the ﬂare was missed by Fermi, which was behind the Earth from 11:09:34 to 11:28:57 UT. In the later phase... using the high cadence measurements, a small increase in intensity in the 14–27 and 27–50 keV channels is noticeable…”
