## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the statistical relation among solar flare parameters, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the existence of sigmoidal structures in active regions. The study uses multi-instrument datasets collected over nearly a decade—from December 2006 to June 2015—to examine how features observed in soft-X-ray images, coronagraph images, and continuous X-ray flux data correlate with eruptive activity. The authors compare properties such as flare duration, rise and decay times, X-ray class, CME speed, and CME width, and they assess how the presence of S- (or inverse S-) shaped sigmoidal structures in coronal images is associated with the occurrence of CMEs.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Hinode/X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the Hinode Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The Hinode/XRT is used to image the solar corona in soft X-rays and is instrumental for identifying sigmoidal (S-shaped or inverse S-shaped) structures in active regions.
   - In this study, the XRT observations help determine the morphology of high-temperature plasma during solar flares.
   - The XRT observations employed various filters; however, the Be-thin filter was preferentially used due to its optimal balance between temperature sensitivity and image clarity (avoiding saturation or blurring).
- **Supporting Quote**: “To identify sigmoidal structures, we analyzed soft‐X‐ray images observed with the X‐ray telescope (XRT: Golub et al. 2007; Kano et al. 2008) aboard the Hinode satellite. … Thus, images with Be‐thin were used in our study.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Sigmoid Identification for Flare Events
- **Time Range**: December 2006 – June 2015  
   - These dates mark the overall period during which the 211 M-class and X-class flare events were observed.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “A set of 211 ﬂare events were selected from a time period between December 2006 and June 2015 …”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray range as determined by the filter responses; primarily through the Be-thin filter.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…the majority of the chosen ﬂare events were observed with the Be‐thin, Ti‐poly, and Al‐thick. … Thus, images with Be‐thin were used in our study.”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Spatial distribution and morphology of coronal plasma, particularly the identification of S-shaped bright regions (sigmoids) indicating twisted magnetic field lines.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…sigmoidal structures in soft‐X‐ray images … are identified as S‐shaped or inverse S‐shaped structures with higher intensity than the surrounding structures…”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The XRT images are recorded with spatial resolutions of either 384 × 384 or 512 × 512 pixels, with a plate scale of ~1″.0286 per pixel.
   - The time cadence of observations varies per event (about 1–5 minutes).

### 2. Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) – Spectropolarimeter (SP) on board the Hinode Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The SOT/SP provides high-precision photospheric magnetic field maps that are essential for understanding the magnetic conditions preceding flares.
   - In the context of this study, SOT/SP observations are used to select events based on the presence of a detailed magnetic field measurement.
- **Supporting Quote**: “...there existed at least one map observed with the spectropolarimeter (SP; Lites et al. 2013), which is one of two focal‐plane instruments of the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008; Shimizu et al. 2008; Suematsu et al. 2008; Ichimoto et al. 2008) aboard the Hinode satellite…”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic Field Mapping Around Flare Peaks
- **Time Range**: Within 6 hours before and after each flare peak  
   - This temporal window is applied to ensure that the photospheric magnetic field context is captured in close proximity to the flare events.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...at least one map … within 6 h before and after the ﬂare peak.”
- **Wavelength(s)/Detector**: 
   - The SP uses spectrally resolved measurements (visible light) to detect polarization signals, which are then used to infer magnetic field properties.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The instrument observes the photospheric magnetic field configurations, which provide context for identifying the magnetic conditions responsible for flare and CME initiation.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The SP data supports subsequent analyses linking photospheric magnetic field parameters with flare and CME characteristics.

### 3. SOHO/LASCO on board the SOHO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) is used to detect and characterize CMEs by imaging the solar corona at larger distances from the Sun.
   - It provides measurements of CME speed and width by tracking the propagation of plasma in the outer corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: “To derive the existence and physical parameters of CMEs, we used the SOHO/LASCO catalog (Yashiro et al. 2004; Gopalswamy et al. 2009). In the SOHO/LASCO catalog, the existence of CMEs is manually identified from LASCO C2 and C3 data, which cover the outer corona for 2.5–6.0 solar radii (C2) and 3.7–30 solar radii (C3).”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Identification for Flare Events
- **Time Range**: Implicitly corresponding to the overall event selection period (December 2006 to June 2015)
   - Although no precise flare-to-CME timing window is specified, the LASCO catalog data used spans the same extensive period as the flare events.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - LASCO primarily records white-light images through Thomson scattering; specific passive wavelength channels are not described.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Detection and measurement of CMEs, specifically their occurrence, speed (derived via height-time plots), and width.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 and C3 instruments provide complementary fields-of-view that help cover low- to high-altitude corona, ensuring robust CME detection.

### 4. GOES Soft X-Ray Sensor on GOES Satellites
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES soft X-ray sensors continuously monitor the Sun’s X-ray flux, which is essential for classifying flares by their X-ray intensity.
   - In this study, GOES data is used both to identify flare start, peak, and end times and to derive physical parameters such as flare duration, rise time, and decay time.
- **Supporting Quote**: “To derive the duration of ﬂares, we used time series of the 1–8 ˚A soft‑X‑ray ﬂux observed by GOES, which obtains data at 2 s or 3 s intervals (GOES 13–15 or GOES 11–12, respectively)…”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Continuous Flare Monitoring
- **Time Range**: During each individual flare event within the overall study period (December 2006 – June 2015)
   - GOES continuously records the soft-X-ray flux, allowing for precise temporal characterization of each flare.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…provides us with a continuous soft‑X‑ray ﬂux during solar ﬂares.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å (soft X-ray range)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…soft‑X‑ray ﬂux observed by GOES.”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The GOES sensors measure X-ray flux time curves, from which flare parameters such as peak intensity, rise time, decay time, and overall duration are determined.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The high time resolution (2–3 s per measurement, rebinned to 6 s for analysis) is critical for accurately identifying flare dynamics.
