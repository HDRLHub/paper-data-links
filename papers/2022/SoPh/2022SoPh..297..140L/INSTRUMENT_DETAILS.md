# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the state of the solar corona during the minimum and ascending phases of Solar Cycle 25 (SC 25) by analyzing the temporal evolutions of its radiance and the properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The study uses white-light observations from the SOHO/LASCO-C2 coronagraph and compares these observations with those from previous solar cycles. The paper highlights the steep increase in solar activity during SC 25, the differences in the latitudinal extent of the streamer belt, and the hemispheric asymmetry in CME activity. The findings are contextualized with ongoing solar missions like Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.

## Instrumentation Details

### LASCO-C2 on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO-C2 (Large-Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) has provided continuous white-light observations of the solar corona since 1996. It is instrumental in tracking the radiance of the K-corona and the occurrence of CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The white-light images obtained with the 'LASCO-C2' Large-Angle Spectrometric COronagraph (Brueckner et al. (1995)) of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo, Fleck, and Poland (1995)) have allowed an unprecedented continuous coverage of the activity of the solar corona, starting in 1996 and still on-going."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observations of the solar corona
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2014.5
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A first analysis of the temporal evolution of the white-light corona over the first 18.5 years (1996.0 – 2014.5) based on these images was performed by Barlyaeva, Lamy, and Llebaria (2015)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Radiance of the K-corona
   - **Supporting Quote**: "They showed that the K-corona tracks solar activity at all time scales up to the solar cycle, including mid-term quasi-periodicities (also known as quasi-biennial oscillations or QBOs)."
- **Additional Comments**: This period includes the analysis of the correlation between the integrated coronal radiance and various indices and proxies of solar activity.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Analysis of the solar minima and ascending phases
- **Time Range**: 2014.5 – 2022.2
   - **Supporting Quote**: "With new LASCO-C2 data now extending to the beginning of 2022, thus covering the complete minimum phase of SC 25 and its ascending phase, we are in position to extend our past analysis."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Radiance of the K-corona, CME properties
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We are particularly interested in characterizing these phases and comparing them with those of the past solar cycles on the basis of the evolution of the radiance of the K-corona and the CME activity."
- **Additional Comments**: This period focuses on the comparison of the solar minima of SC 23, SC 24, and SC 25, and the analysis of the steep increase in solar activity during the ascending phase of SC 25.

### ARTEMIS-II Catalog (part of the LASCO-C2 Legacy Archive)
- **General Comments**:
   - The ARTEMIS-II catalog is used to detect and characterize CMEs based on their morphological appearance in synoptic maps. It provides parameters such as time of detection, central apparent latitude, angular width, intensity, velocity, mass, and kinetic energy of CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The present article makes use of images of the radiance of the K-corona and of the ARTEMIS-II catalog part of the LASCO-C2 Legacy Archive hosted at the Integrated Data and Operation Center (formerly MEDOC) of Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME detection and characterization
- **Time Range**: 6 June 1996 – 7 February 2022
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For the time interval considered in this study, from 6 June 1996 to 7 February 2022, the ARTEMIS-II (hereafter abbreviated to ARTEMIS for simplicity) catalog lists a total of 42,165 CMEs, of which 23,885 have their velocities, mass, and kinetic energy determined."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: CME properties (time of detection, central apparent latitude, angular width, intensity, velocity, mass, kinetic energy)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "It lists CMEs detected since June 1996 with the following parameters: time of detection at 3 R⊙, central apparent latitude, angular width, and intensity. The intensity of a CME is calculated by integrating its radiance on the synoptic maps at 3 R⊙and subtracting the local coronal background."
- **Additional Comments**: The catalog is crucial for analyzing the temporal variation of CME occurrence rates, mass rates, and other properties over multiple solar cycles.
