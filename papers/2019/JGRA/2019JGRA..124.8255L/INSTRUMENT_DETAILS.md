## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a moderate C1.1 class confined solar flare that occurred on 2013 September 24 at 22:56 UT in an arch filament system adjacent to a regular, unipolar sunspot in NOAA AR 11846. Multiple instruments are used to study the pre‐flare configuration, the evolution of the filament, small-scale precursor flaring events driven by flux cancellation, and the subsequent two-ribbon flare. Detailed spectro‐polarimetric data reveal the magnetic configuration in the photosphere while high-cadence imaging in the chromosphere and transition region provides information about the filament dynamics. Observations from the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP-II) at the 70 cm Vacuum Tower Telescope, the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI), and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO are combined to diagnose both the photospheric magnetic field and the coronal connectivity immediately preceding and during the flare.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP-II) on board the 70 cm German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT)
- **General Comments**:
   - TIP-II was used to perform high-resolution spectro-polarimetric observations of NOAA AR 11846. The instrument provided full-Stokes polarimetry in the near infrared to probe the photospheric magnetic field via two spectral lines.
   - It employed a dichroic beam splitter to send part of the light to the wave-front sensor while directing the remainder to the science focus.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "I carried out spectropolarimetric observations of NOAA AR 11846 on 2013 September 24 using the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP-II; Collados et al., 2007) at the 70 cm German Vacuum Tower Telescope."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Full Spectral Scan of the Sunspot
- **Time Range**: 9:53 – 10:26 UT on 2013 September 24
   - **Supporting Quote**: "At each slit position and for a single modulation state, ten exposures of 250 ms each were accumulated... The scan lasted from 9:53–10:26 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - Fe I at 10783.05 Å and Si I at 10786.85 Å 
   - **Supporting Quote**: "TIP II provided spectral scans with full-Stokes polarimetry in the near infrared region comprising the Fe I line at 10783.05 Å, and the Si I line at 10786.85 Å."
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Full-Stokes polarization profiles used to extract the vector magnetic field and other photospheric parameters.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The vector magnetic field and other relevant physical parameters were extracted from the TIP-II spectro-polarimetric observations..."

#### Additional Comments:
   - The instrument’s spatial sampling was about 0.′′17 along the slit, and the spectral sampling was 11.05 mÅ. Calibration included flat-fielding and polarization correction with a rotatable linear polarizer and a phase plate.

### 2. Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provided continuum intensity filtergrams and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms to monitor the evolution of the photospheric magnetic field.
   - These data were critical for understanding magnetic flux cancellation at the weak polarity inversion line (PIL) under the arch filament.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The HMI data consist of continuum intensity filtergrams and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms having a cadence of 45 s."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-Flare Magnetic Field Monitoring
- **Time Range**: 21:00 UT – 22:56 UT on 2013 September 24
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The HMI and AIA data were selected to span a duration of 3 hr starting at 21:00 UT leading up to the C1.1 ﬂare at 22:56 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - Not applicable (continuum filtergrams and LOS magnetograms)
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Measurement of continuum intensity and LOS magnetic field to track magnetic flux changes and flux cancellation.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The HMI LOS magnetogram has been overlaid on the AIA 304 Å image for an overall perspective, that shows the filament F1 arching from the leading sunspot to the network flux region."

#### Additional Comments:
   - The cadence of 45 s allowed detailed tracking of emerging and cancelling flux elements associated with the precursor flaring events.

### 3. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA captured imaging data in multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels to study the chromospheric and transition region response during the precursor events and the C1.1 flare.
   - It provided images in several channels including He II 304 Å and Fe IX 171 Å, among others.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "the AIA observations comprise filtergrams in the He ii 304 Å and Fe ix 171 Å bands having a cadence of 1 min." 
   - Moreover, "AIA images with a cadence of 12 s were also utilized close to the time of the precursor events."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Multi-Channel EUV Imaging Preceding and During the Flare
- **Time Range**: 21:00 UT – 22:56 UT on 2013 September 24
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The HMI and AIA data were selected to span a duration of 3 hr starting at 21:00 UT leading up to the C1.1 ﬂare at 22:56 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Primary channels: He II 304 Å and Fe IX 171 Å
   - Additional channels mentioned for precursor activity: 193, 211 Å (hotter channels), and the absence of emission in 335 and 94 Å bands provided clues to plasma temperatures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In addition to these events, the AR is also characterized by several other dynamic phenomena... these precursor events are also seen in the hotter 193 and 211 Å channels but not in the 335 and 94 Å bands..."
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Observation of chromospheric features such as arch filament systems, superpenumbral whirls, filament brightening, and plasma dynamics (expansion, untwisting, and rising motions).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 3 shows a sequence of AIA 304 Å and 171 Å images centered on the filament F1... a similar set of loops are seen to unravel from F1, expanding rapidly southwards..." 
   - Also used to track the height–time evolution of the rising filament and its deceleration.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The combination of 1 min cadence images over a 3-hr period with burst imaging (12 s cadence) during rapid events enabled detailed timing of the precursor flare onsets, the eruption dynamics of the filament, and the two-ribbon flare formation.
