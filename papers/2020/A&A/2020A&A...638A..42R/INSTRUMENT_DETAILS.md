## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies the correlation between the kinematic parameters of non‐interacting halo CMEs and the intensities of solar energetic particle (SEP) events during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 24 (approximately 2009–2013). The authors compare results obtained from different observation platforms to determine how instantaneous CME speeds (and corresponding Mach numbers) correlate with SEP fluxes over several energy ranges (>10 MeV, >50 MeV, and >100 MeV). In addition, the work contrasts CME speeds measured with SOHO/LASCO with those obtained via STEREO/SECCHI. Supporting observations include SEP flux measurements from GOES satellites and soft X‐ray data associated with the flares that accompany these CMEs. The study thereby uses a variety of instruments (each with its unique detector, wavelength sensitivity, and field of view) to reconstruct the full kinematics of the CMEs over different heliocentric distances.

### 1. SOHO/LASCO on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is a coronagraph used for observing white-light CME images.
   - It provides height–time measurements that form the basis for determining average and maximum CME speeds.
   - Its field of view covers the inner corona from approximately 1.5 R☉ to 30 R☉.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “For SOHO observations, we used the height–time points from the SOHO/LASCO catalog, …”
   - “... the SOHO/LASCO C2/C3 ﬁeld of view is 1.5 Rsun - 30 Rsun.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: 2009 – 2013 (ascending phase of solar cycle 24)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 (2009-2013)...”
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: White light (continuum observations)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... white light CME images ...” (implied from the use of a coronagraph)
   - **Physical Observable**: CME heights and derived speeds from the white-light images.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Due to projection effects, the speeds obtained by SOHO/LASCO may be modified relative to the true radial speeds of halo CMEs.

### 2. STEREO/SECCHI on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation) is a suite comprising coronagraphs (COR1, COR2) and heliospheric imagers (HI1, HI2).
   - It is used to determine instantaneous CME height–time profiles with a wide field of view, covering from the low corona to large heliocentric distances (approximately 1.5 R☉ to 318 R☉).
   - The quadrature configuration of STEREO relative to Earth during this observational period improves the accuracy of the CME “plane-of-sky” speed, which is close to the true radial speed.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The CME data were obtained from the observations of instruments on board two separate spacecraft: the LASCO instrument on board SOHO and the SECCHI instrument suite on board STEREO.”
   - “... STEREO/SECCHI offers an advantage in studying the CME kinematics at large distances from Sun, … Its field of view is 1.5 Rsun - 318 Rsun.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: 2009 – 2013 (observations taken during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24)
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 (i.e., 2009-2013) …”
   - **Event-Specific Dates**: While the paper considers a sample of 25 events, the observed events range from the first event on 14 August 2010 to the last event on 28 December 2013.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraphic imaging); additional visible-band observations for heliospheric imaging.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “... white light (WL) observations …” (in reference to combined usage in similar studies)
   - **Physical Observable**: CME height, instantaneous speeds, and Mach numbers derived from sequential height–time data points.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The manual measurement of height–time points and application of successive linear fits allow detailed determination of the instantaneous CME velocity profile.
   - STEREO’s wider field-of-view makes it especially useful for tracking CME deceleration over large distances.

### 3. GOES Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS) / SEM on board GOES-13
- **General Comments**:
   - The SEM instrument onboard the GOES-13 geostationary satellite measures energetic proton fluxes used to characterize SEP events.
   - It provides the SEP flux data in three energy channels: >10 MeV, >50 MeV, and >100 MeV.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The SEP ﬂuxes were observed by the SEM instrument on board GOES-13 geostationary satellite recorded in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: While the overall study period is 2009–2013, the specific events (as seen in Table 1) occur between 14 August 2010 and 28 December 2013.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; the instrument detects in situ particle fluxes (energetic proton counts).
   - **Physical Observable**: SEP flux (proton intensity in units of pfu) in different energy bands.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The instrument’s data allow the correlation of CME speeds with SEP intensities by selecting events with flux values above specified thresholds.

### 4. GOES Solar X-Ray Sensor (XRS) on board GOES-15
- **General Comments**:
   - The XRS instrument onboard GOES-15 measures the soft X-ray flux of solar flares.
   - It provides X-ray event files that are used to retrieve the peak X-ray fluxes in the 1–8 Å energy band.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The associated X-ray data were obtained from Solar X-Ray Sensor (XRS) event ﬁles of GOES-15 satellite observations on the NOAA database.”
   - “The soft X-ray ﬂux events recorded in the 1–8 Å energy band were considered for the study.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Again, the period covers the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 (2009–2013); event dates in Table 1—specifically from 14 August 2010 to 28 December 2013.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 1–8 Å (soft X-ray range).
   - **Physical Observable**: X-ray peak flux of solar flares.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The study examines the correlation between X-ray peak fluxes and SEP peak fluxes though it finds a weak direct correlation, suggesting a dominant role for CME-driven shocks, at least for protons in the >10 MeV energy band.

### 5. Wind/WAVES Instrument (for Type II Burst Measurements)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind/WAVES instrument is a radio receiver utilized to detect type II radio bursts that are indicative of CME-driven shock formation.
   - It contributes to the study by providing the timing of shock onsets that are related to SEP production.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The date and time of these shocks can be obtained from Wind/WAVES type II burst catalog (Bougeret et al., 1995).”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: While no explicit observation date range is provided in the paper for Wind/WAVES data, it is referenced as part of the overall study of events during Solar Cycle 24 (approximately 2009–2013).
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Radio wavelengths (specific bands are used to detect type II bursts, though not detailed further in this paper).
   - **Physical Observable**: Detection and timing of type II radio bursts (indicative of shock formation).
- **Additional Comments**:
   - This instrument’s data support the context in which CME shocks are linked with SEP acceleration, although the primary focus remains on kinematics measured by the coronagraphs and imagers.

### 6. Hinode Flare Catalogue (Data Product from Hinode)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Hinode Flare Catalogue compiles data on solar flares including their onset time, peak time, and classification.
   - This ancillary data product supports the analysis of flare properties in relation to CME events and SEP intensities.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The Hinode Flare Catalogue (Watanabe et al., 2012) provides data of the onset time, peak time, and the class of solar ﬂares.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Time Range**: Implicitly coinciding with the study period (2009–2013), as the catalogue is used to select flare events associated with the analyzed CMEs.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly specified; the catalogue compiles flare classifications which often include soft X-ray observations.
   - **Physical Observable**: Timing and intensity (class) of solar flares.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although primarily used to cross-reference flare data, the Hinode catalogue is essential for the part of the analysis that investigates any potential relation between flare X-ray properties and SEP peak fluxes.
