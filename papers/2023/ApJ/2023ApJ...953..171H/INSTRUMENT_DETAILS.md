# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses a case study of a Type II radio burst associated with a C4.5 class flare and a blowout jet on the Sun, but notably without the presence of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The study utilizes observations from multiple instruments to analyze the evolution of the blowout jet, its associated EUV wave, and the Type II radio burst. The paper highlights the relationship between the jet's ejection, the EUV wave, and the radio burst, suggesting that both the EUV wave and the radio burst are manifestations of a coronal shock driven by the jet's ejection. The study provides detailed analysis of the velocities involved, the timing of events, and the physical characteristics observed during the event.
