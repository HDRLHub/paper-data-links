This script demonstrates how to query data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO)
using SunPyâ€™s Fido interface for the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument on board SDO.
Based on the context provided, we focus on HMI data spanning the period from 2010.5 to 2019.5.
In this example, we use an approximate time range from July 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019.
The script prints the query results to the console.
Note: The Fido.fetch command is included but commented out to prevent actual data download.

    # Define the instrument and source for the query.
