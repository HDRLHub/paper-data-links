1. SOHO/ERNE (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron instrument on SOHO)
   - General Comments:
     - SOHO/ERNE is used in the study to measure high‐energy protons in the 55–80 MeV energy channel. Its data are a key part of the multi‐spacecraft event catalogue that spans the period 2009–2016.
   - Data Collection Period for Intercalibration:
     - Time Range: “from the noon of 15 December 2006 to 20:00 UT on 16 December 2006.”
     - Supporting Quote (from Appendix A): “For the purpose of intercalibration, the decay phase of the high-energy proton event of 14 December 2006 was chosen. The time range of interest was taken to span from the noon of 15 December to 20:00 UT on 16 December…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Measures proton intensities (after background subtraction) in the 55–80 MeV channel.
   - Additional Comments:
     - The ERNE data are used both in the multi‐spacecraft analysis (2009–2016) and as a reference for intercalibration against STEREO/HET intensities.

2. STEREO/HET (High Energy Telescope on STEREO spacecraft – STEREO-A/HET and STEREO-B/HET)
   - General Comments:
     - The HET instruments on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B record high-energy protons. Their energy measurement is provided in two sub-channels (40–60 MeV and 60–100 MeV) and a combined channel (40–100 MeV) is formed for better count statistics.
     - Their measurements contribute to the identification of wide SEP events in the 2009–2016 catalogue.
   - Data Collection Period for Intercalibration:
     - Time Range: The same intercalibration study as for ERNE was applied to the decay phase of the 14 December 2006 event; specifically, data from “noon on 15 December 2006 to 20:00 UT on 16 December 2006” were examined.
     - Supporting Quote (from Appendix A): “To assure that the spacecraft observations were made of nearly identical SEP populations, the decay phase of the high-energy proton event of 14 December 2006 was chosen…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Measures proton intensities in the 40–60 MeV and 60–100 MeV ranges.
     - A derived linear combination (IHET,lin) is computed using a weighted sum of the two channels, with the parameter a ≈ 0.78 chosen to best match the ERNE intensities.
   - Additional Comments:
     - Both STEREO-A and STEREO-B HET data are considered comparable within about ±20% when using the combined channel.

3. ACE/EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor on ACE)
   - General Comments:
     - ACE/EPAM is used for measuring energetic electrons in the low-energy electron channels. Two detector telescopes are utilized: LEFS60 and DE30.
     - In the study, the reference energy channel for electrons is 0.18–0.31 MeV.
   - Data Collection Period for Intercalibration:
     - Time Range: “late May of 2007” – the decay phases of two small electron events from this period were used.
     - Supporting Quote (from Appendix A): “The decay phases of two small electron events in late May of 2007...were chosen for comparison…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Measures omnidirectional electron intensities in the 0.18–0.31 MeV band.
     - Quiet‐time background intensities (8.0 pfu MeV⁻¹ for LEFS60 and 20.0 pfu MeV⁻¹ for DE30) are subtracted prior to analysis.
   - Additional Comments:
     - After intercomparison with STEREO/SEPT data, correction factors of 0.84 (for LEFS60) and 0.65 (for DE30) were applied.

4. STEREO/SEPT (Solar Electron Proton Telescope on STEREO spacecraft – available on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B)
   - General Comments:
     - SEPT measures electron intensities in combined energy channels; the ones of interest cover 0.165–0.335 MeV and 0.195–0.335 MeV.
     - As the SEPT observations are used in tandem with ACE/EPAM for electron event analysis, they form an essential part of the multi-spacecraft electron study.
   - Data Collection Period for Intercalibration:
     - Time Range: “late May of 2007” – the same decay phases of two small electron events were used to intercompare SEPT with ACE/EPAM.
     - Supporting Quote (from Appendix A): “The decay phases of two small electron events in late May of 2007 were chosen for comparison…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Measures electron intensities with a quiet-time background of approximately 2.0 pfu MeV⁻¹ subtracted.
   - Additional Comments:
     - The agreement between SEPT-A and SEPT-B was found to be within 2%; thus, no further intercalibration between the two was necessary.

5. SOHO/LASCO (Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph aboard SOHO)
   - General Comments:
     - SOHO/LASCO is used to observe Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in white light.
     - The LASCO data, as compiled in the CDAW SOHO LASCO CME Catalog, provide key observables such as the first observation time of the CME, estimated radial speed, and CME width.
   - Data Collection Period:
     - Time Range: The LASCO observations used for this study cover the events during the multi-spacecraft SEP catalogue of 2009–2016.
     - Supporting Quote (from the body of the paper): “Consulting the CDAW SOHO LASCO CME Catalog… a halo-type CME with an estimated speed… was first observed by SOHO/LASCO…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Observes the spatial distribution, widths, and speeds of CMEs.
     - These white-light signatures are used in the analysis of SEP associations.

6. STEREO/SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation onboard STEREO)
   - General Comments:
     - The SECCHI instrument suite includes coronagraphs (e.g., COR1, COR2) and extreme ultraviolet imagers (EUVI) which are used for both CME detection and for imaging solar flares (particularly farside events).
     - SECCHI/COR data contribute to the Dual-Viewpoint CME Catalog, offering combined observations (from STEREO-A and STEREO-B) in addition to SOHO/LASCO.
   - Data Collection Period:
     - Time Range: SECCHI observations relevant to this study span the period 2009–2016 as the multi-spacecraft event catalogue covers this interval.
     - Supporting Quote (from the text): “The Dual-Viewpoint CME Catalog lists the same CME as first observed at 1:24 UT at both STEREO-A and -B…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Provides CME detection (first appearance, estimated speed) and solar EUV imaging (for example, the 30.4 nm bandpass images used to identify EUV brightenings associated with farside flares).
   - Additional Comments:
     - SECCHI’s multiple components allow for “multi-vantage point” measurements of solar transient events.

7. Radio Wave Instruments (Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES)
   - General Comments:
     - These instruments are used to monitor solar radio emissions such as type III radio bursts, which serve as additional evidence for particle injection events associated with solar flares and CMEs.
   - Data Collection Period:
     - Time Range: Although no precise time ranges are given in the excerpt, these instruments continuously monitor radio emissions during the SEP events included in the catalogue (primarily during the 2009–2016 period).
     - Supporting Quote (from the body of the paper): “Radio observations of type III bursts by STEREO/WAVES and Wind/WAVES lend support to this association…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - They record the dynamic radio spectrum, capturing type III and type II radio burst signatures.
   - Additional Comments:
     - Their data are used in conjunction with X-ray and white-light observations to establish solar flare and CME associations with SEP events.

8. ACE/SWEPAM (Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor on ACE)
   - General Comments:
     - SWEPAM is used to measure the solar wind speed near Earth.
     - In the context of this study, the SWEPAM data are utilized to help compute spiral field line lengths which, in turn, are needed for time-shifting analysis (TSA) of SEP release times.
   - Data Collection Period:
     - Time Range: SWEPAM observations are collected continuously during the SEP event periods (noted within the 2009–2016 multi-spacecraft study).
     - Supporting Quote (from the text): “The Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) of ACE… is used for determining the solar wind speed…”
   - Physical Observables:
     - Measures solar wind parameters (including bulk speed) which are essential for correcting particle travel times in TSA.
   - Additional Comments:
     - The SWEPAM data are employed together with data from STEREO/PLASTIC and Wind/SWE (mentioned in passing) to compute the magnetic connection geometry.
