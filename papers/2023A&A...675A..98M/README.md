## About
This repository contains files that have been generated to aid in the understanding and analysis of the paper. The download script included here is specifically designed to retrieve data from the [Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO)](https://sdac.virtualsolar.org/cgi/search).

## VSO Instruments Used

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">AIA
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> The prominence eruption was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012) spacecraft.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> SDO/AIA takes full-disk images in seven EUV wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335 Å) and two UV wavelengths (1600 and 1700 Å).<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> The prominence is supported by a highly twisted magnetic flux rope and shows rapid rotation in the counterclockwise direction during the rising motion.
  </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">SWAP
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> Writhing motion during 17:42−17:46 UT is clearly observed by SWAP in 174 Å.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> The prominence was also observed in 174 Å (log T ≈5.8) by the Sun Watcher using Active Pixel System detector and image processing (SWAP).<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> The prominence, which is indicated by the arrows, starts to rise at ∼17:09 UT, accompanied by southwestward drift until ∼17:42 UT.
  </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">EUVI
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> The event was simultaneously captured by the ahead and behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser et al., 2008) spacecraft from two perspectives.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> EUVI takes full-disk images out to 1.7 R⊙ in 171, 195, 284, and 304 Å.<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> This provides a unique opportunity to study the prominence eruption from three perspectives simultaneously.
  </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">LASCO
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> The associated CME was observed by the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) on board SOHO spacecraft.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> The LASCO-C2 and LASCO-C3 white light (WL) coronagraphs have FOVs of 2−6 R⊙ and 4−30 R⊙, respectively.<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> The CME first appears at t0 =17:24 UT and rises up in the northwest direction, showing a typical three-part structure.
  </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">GOES
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> Soft X-ray (SXR) light curves of the Sun in 1−8 Å and 0.5−4 Å were recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) spacecraft.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> The observational parameters are listed in Table 1.<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> The huge enhancements of SXR emission starting at 15:48 UT and peaking at 16:05 UT originate from the X2.8 class flare.
  </span>
</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2em;" class="tooltip">COR1 and COR2
  <span class="tooltiptext">
    <b>Time:</b> The CME was also detected by the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B.<br><br>
    <b>Wavelength:</b> The running-difference images of the CME in the FOV of COR1 and COR2 on board STA are displayed.<br><br>
    <b>Physical Observable:</b> The CME first appears at 17:10 UT with the same three-part morphology and propagates in the northeast direction.
