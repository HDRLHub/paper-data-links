## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the three‐dimensional reconstruction of particle acceleration regions during a coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 14 June 2012. By combining radio imaging, dynamic spectral observations, white‐light coronagraph imagery, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, the authors determine the emission mechanism behind moving radio bursts observed during the eruption. The study makes use of a variety of instruments to capture different aspects of the event: radio instruments provide details on flux, polarization, and spectral indices; white‐light and EUV imagers track the evolution and structure of the CME; and in‐situ particle detectors record energetic electrons associated with the event. Precise time ranges (with UT stamps) and wavelength/energy information are provided for each instrument, which together enable a 3D reconstruction of the CME and the associated particle acceleration regions.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NRH provides radio images of the Sun that capture the bursty, narrow-band moving radio sources. It measures total intensity (Stokes I), circular polarization (Stokes V), and is used to derive spectral indices. The observations feature emission at 150 MHz, 173 MHz, and occasionally 228 MHz.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   - "The moving radio bursts in Fig. 1 are mostly observed in images at 150 and 173 MHz from the NRH (see Movies 1 and 2 accompanying this paper), except for Source 1 that is also sometimes prominent at 228 MHz."

   - **Additional Comments**:  
      - Uncertainties in absolute calibration (∼10–20%) are noted and the narrow-band, bursty characteristics suggest fundamental plasma emission.
