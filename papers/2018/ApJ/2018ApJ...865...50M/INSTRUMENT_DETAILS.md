## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents an improved Flux Rope Internal State (FRIS) model to study the thermodynamic evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) by constraining the model with observed propagation and expansion kinematics. The study applies the FRIS model to a CME event on 2008 December 12 and derives internal parameters such as the polytropic index, density, temperature, forces (Lorentz, thermal pressure, centrifugal) and the energetic evolution (heat and entropy changes) of the CME plasma. The CME is observed from multiple spacecraft through a range of instruments (coronagraphs and extreme ultraviolet imagers) that capture the CME from the low corona out to the outer corona.

- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO is a suite of coronagraphs that image the solar corona in white light, capturing the CME evolution over a larger field of view.

  - “The triplet of concurrent images are taken from STEREO/COR2-B (left), SOHO/LASCO-C2 (middle), and STEREO/COR2-A (right) around 12:07 UT on 2008 December 12.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Extended Outer-Corona Imaging with LASCO-C3

### 4. SECCHI/EUVI-A on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
  - The EUVI instrument captures extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images; for this study it images the prominence eruption associated with the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...the CME was associated with a prominence eruption that started at 03:00 UT in the NE quadrant observed in SECCHI/EUVI-A 304˚A images.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence Eruption Imaging

### 5. SECCHI/COR2-A and SECCHI/COR2-B on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
  - These coronagraphs image the corona at a higher altitude than COR1, and are used for detailed three-dimensional modeling of the CME using the GCS (Graduated Cylindrical Shell) model.

### 6. Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
  - The HIs provide extended field-of-view imaging of the CME as it propagates further into the heliosphere.
  - They complement the coronagraph observations by tracking the CME at larger distances from the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “The CME is well observed by the SOHO/LASCO, Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; …) coronagraphs and the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) on board STEREO.”
- **Note on Time Range**:
  - A specific time range is not provided in the text; however, the HIs are mentioned as part of the instrumentation suite tracking the CME evolution beyond the immediate corona.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light, typically optimized for low signal detections in the heliosphere.
- **Physical Observable**: CME propagation through the heliosphere is monitored to provide context for the kinematic evolution.
- **Additional Comments**: Although detailed time stamps are not given for the HI observations, they help bridge the gap between coronagraph fields-of-view and in situ measurements at larger distances.
