## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at proving the hypothesis that a train of small-scale features observed by the Wide-field Imager (WISPR) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) are the signature of a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI). These features were seen near the flank of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) wake between 7.5 Re and 9.5 Re, lasting for about 30 minutes. The CME was a slow event, associated with a streamer blowout. The study analyzed the size of the eddies and found growth during their evolution while maintaining separation distances and alignment typical of Kelvin–Helmholtz vortexes. The magnetic field conditions that would make the observation of such an instability plausible were also assessed. Two methods were used to cross-check the findings, including the measured thickness of the boundary layer and the estimated linear growth rate suggesting nonlinear saturation within the expected timescale. The study concludes that a KHI is a plausible explanation for the observed features, and such instabilities might exist in the low and middle solar corona (within ∼15 Re) and can be detected in white light observations. However, their observation might be rare due to stringent conditions like the observer’s proximity, suitable viewing circumstances, magnetic field topology, and flow properties.

## Instrumentation Details

### WISPR on board Parker Solar Probe
- **General Comments**:
   - WISPR, the remote-sensing instrument onboard PSP, consists of two white-light telescopes covering a combined angular field of view from 13.5° to 108° elongation. The proximity to the circumsolar structures and sensitivity of the WISPR telescopes have enabled detailed observation of the evolution of both small- and large-scale structures in unprecedented detail.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of small-scale eddy features in the wake of a CME
- **Time Range**: November 20, 01:48 UT – November 20, 02:33 UT
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
- **Physical Observable**: Small-scale eddy features indicative of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability
- **Additional Comments**: The eddies were observed close to the southern flank of the CME between 7.5 Re and 9.5 Re. The features were analyzed for their size, growth, and alignment typical of Kelvin–Helmholtz vortexes. The observations were made possible due to the unique capabilities of WISPR and the proximity of PSP to the observed phenomena.
