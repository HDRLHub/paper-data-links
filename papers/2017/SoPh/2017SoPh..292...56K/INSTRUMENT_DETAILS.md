## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper reports on a targeted observational campaign conducted in August 2012 to measure the Faraday rotation imparted by three coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar corona using a constellation of extragalactic radio sources. Sensitive, full-polarization observations were made using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at frequencies between 1–2 GHz. Simultaneously, white-light imaging data were acquired using the LASCO/C3 coronagraph aboard SOHO and the COR2 coronagraphs onboard STEREO-A and STEREO-B to independently track the CMEs and estimate plasma density via Thomson scattering. Three sources (0842+1835, 0843+1547, and 0900+1832) were occulted by CMEs on August 2, 2012. The VLA provided direct measurements of Faraday rotation through the CMEs, while the LASCO/C3 and STEREO COR2-A/-B coronagraph data enabled determination of the spatial context and independent plasma diagnostics. All results are based on these datasets, whose details, observation periods, wavelengths, and physical observables are fully documented below.

### Very Large Array (VLA)

- **General Comments**:
  - The VLA was used in full-polarization mode at 1–2 GHz to directly measure the coronal Faraday rotation to a constellation of extragalactic radio sources as they were occulted by CMEs during August 2012.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We made sensitive Very Large Array (VLA) full-polarization observations using 1−2 GHz frequencies of a 'constellation' of radio sources through the solar corona at heliocentric distances that ranged from 6 −15R⊙. ... Of the nine sources observed, three were occulted by CMEs: two sources (0842+1835 and 0900+1832) were occulted by a single CME and one source (0843+1547) was occulted by two CMEs."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME occultation and reference observations
- **Time Range**: 2012-08-02 14:46 UT – 2012-08-02 20:53 UT (primary event observations); reference observations on 2012-08-30 15:04 UT – 2012-08-30 19:03 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Observations of the CME-occulted target sources performed on August 2, 2012, lasted from 14:46 to 20:53 UT and the reference observations performed on August 30, 2012, lasted from 15:04 to 19:03 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1.0–2.0 GHz, subdivided into 7 bands (effective bandwidths 34–56 MHz each, seven central frequencies between 1.356 and 1.899 GHz)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Simultaneous observations were made at (L-band) frequencies of 1.0 −2.0 GHz divided into 16 bands, each with a resolution (channel width) of 1 MHz."  
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Of the original 16 frequency bands, we retained 7 with center frequencies of 1.356 GHz (bandwidth = 34 MHz), 1.409 (bandwidth = 56 MHz), 1.473 (bandwidth = 56 MHz), 1.725 (bandwidth = 40 MHz), 1.781 (bandwidth = 56 MHz), 1.845 (bandwidth = 56 MHz), and 1.899 (bandwidth = 37 MHz)."
- **Physical Observable**: Faraday rotation (rotation measure, RM) of polarized extragalactic radio sources induced by solar coronal plasma and CMEs
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Faraday rotation (FR) is the rotation of the plane of polarization that results when a linearly polarized signal passes through a magnetized plasma such as a CME ... FR observations of a source near the Sun can provide information on the plasma structure of a CME shortly after launch..."

- **Additional Comments**:
  - Impact parameters: Heliocentric distances of 6–15 R⊙ for the lines of sight (see Table 1).
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The basis of this paper is radioastronomical observations made in August, 2012, during the annual solar occultation of the extragalactic radio sources 0842+1835, 0843+1547, 0846+1459, and 0900+1832 ... at heliocentric distances (our parameter R0) ranging over 5 −15R⊙."

  - Measured both Stokes I, Q, U, and V, enabling determination of linear polarization parameters and time-resolved Faraday rotation.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "For each source, we generated maps in the Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and V for each scan as well as a 'session map' made from all the data on a given day, at a given frequency."

### LASCO/C3 Coronagraph on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - Used to obtain white-light images of the solar corona to determine plasma density along the lines of sight to the radio sources via measurements of Thomson scattering brightness, providing independent estimation of the plasma density structure of the CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "In addition to our radioastronomical observations, which represent one of the ﬁrst active hunts for CME Faraday rotation since Bird et al. (1985) and the ﬁrst active hunt using the VLA, we obtained white-light coronagraph images from the LASCO/C3 instrument to determine the Thomson scattering brightness, BT, providing a means to independently estimate the plasma density and determine its contribution to the observed Faraday rotation."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME tracking during VLA campaign
- **Time Range**: 2012-08-02 00:00 UT – 2012-08-02 23:59 UT (primary CME event coverage); background estimation from images spanning 2012-07-18 through 2012-08-16
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We downloaded all LASCO/C3 Level 1 FITS images for August 2 as well as for the ﬁfteen days prior to August 2 and the ﬁfteen days following August 2, for a total of 31 days."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light, visible continuum (LASCO/C3 operates over 400–850 nm)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Modern observations of the corona are primarily obtained using white-light coronagraphs which observe radiation from the photosphere that has been Thomson-scattered by electrons in the coronal plasma."
- **Physical Observable**: Total brightness (Thomson scattering brightness, BT) caused by electrons in the corona and CMEs, used to derive electron density along the lines of sight to radio sources
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The Thomson scattering brightness, BT, is directly related to the coronal electron density, ne, by the line of sight integral..."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Used to track the occurrence, propagation, and plasma content of CME-1, CME-2, and CME-3, as well as to determine the CME geometry, leading edge location, and penetration depth along each line of sight.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "Our total intensity white-light analysis in this paper relies primarily on coronagraph observations from the SOHO LASCO/C3 ..."
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The LASCO/C3 images also provide us with the unique ability to track the progression of the line of sight for a given target source through the CMEs observed on August 2 (e.g., Figure 4). we measured the depth in pixels to which each line of sight penetrated a CME for every LASCO/C3 image. This CME penetration depth, yp, was used in modeling the Thomson brightness and Faraday rotation associated with occultation by a CME and is discussed in further detail in Section 4.2. For CMEs displaying the classical three-part structure (e.g., CME-1 and CME-2), the radius of the CME, Rcme, was also determined using these images."
  - Field of View: 3.7–32 R⊙

### COR2-A and COR2-B Coronagraphs on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B

- **General Comments**:
  - Used to obtain additional white-light images from multiple vantage points to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure and line-of-sight crossings of the CMEs, especially for distinguishing overlapping events and determining precise CME-source occultation geometry.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Using the multiple viewpoints provided by LASCO/C3 and STEREO-A/COR2, we model observations of 0843+1547 using two ﬂux ropes embedded in the background corona and demonstrate this model’s ability to successfully reproduce both BT and FR proﬁles."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Tracing the approximate position of the line of sight to 0843 onto COR2-A images (downloaded from http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil) made it possible to follow the progression of this line of sight through CME-1 (appearing in the foreground of LASCO/C3 images and the background of COR2-A images) and CME-2 (appearing in the background of LASCO/C3 images and the foreground of COR2-A images)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME tracking for overlapping occultations
- **Time Range**: 2012-08-02 00:00 UT – 2012-08-02 23:59 UT

- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light, visible continuum (SECCHI/COR2 operates over ~650–750 nm)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Modern observations of the corona are primarily obtained using white-light coronagraphs which observe radiation from the photosphere that has been Thomson-scattered by electrons in the coronal plasma."
- **Physical Observable**: Total brightness due to Thomson scattering; allows determination of CME structure, location, and evolution from side-on perspectives
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The true power in these multiple white-light imaging instruments lies in combining measurements from SOHO, STEREO-A, and STEREO-B. Using white-light measurement of CMEs from these multiple vantage points, Mierla et al. (2010) reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of numerous, single CME events from 2007 and 2008. ... Tracing the approximate position of the line of sight to 0843 onto COR2-A images ... made it possible to follow the progression of this line of sight through CME-1 ... and CME-2."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Field of View: 2.5–15 R⊙
    - **Supporting Quote**: "which overlaps the STEREO-A and STEREO-B COR2 ﬁeld of view of 2.5 −15R⊙, respectively."
  - Key for establishing which radio sources were occulted by which CME and resolving complex, overlapping events not distinguishable from the SOHO perspective alone.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "It is only with both sets of images that we are able to track the leading edges of CME-1 and CME-2 as their outer loops occult 0843, allowing us to employ a two ﬂux rope model."
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The leading edge and structure of CME-2 is clear, though, in COR2-A white-light images. It is only with both sets of images that we are able to track the leading edges of CME-1 and CME-2..."
