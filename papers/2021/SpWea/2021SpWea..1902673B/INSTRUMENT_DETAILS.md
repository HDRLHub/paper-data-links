1. X-ray Telescopes on NASA Skylab  
   - General Comments:  
     These telescopes, aboard NASA’s Skylab satellite, were responsible for some of the earliest space‐observations of the Sun’s corona. Their observations in the X‐ray range led to the identification of dark patches in the Sun’s polar regions.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “It was only in the 1970s, through the view of X‐ray telescopes on the NASA Skylab satellite, that the dark patches in the Sun’s polar regions were identified as coronal holes.”  
   - Time Range:  
     1970s  
   - Wavelength(s) or Detector Details:  
     Operated in the X‐ray regime, detecting X‐ray wavelengths that reveal coronal features.  
   - Physical Observable:  
     X‐ray emission from the solar corona that highlights coronal holes.

2. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Instruments from the National Solar Observatory  
   - General Comments:  
     The paper relies on magnetic maps of the photospheric magnetic field provided by this network. These ground‐based instruments monitor and record changes in the solar magnetic field, which are crucial input for reconstructing the global coronal magnetic topology.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “Our framework relies on magnetic maps of the photospheric magnetic field from the Global Oscillation Network Group from the National Solar Observatory.”  
   - Time Range:  
     (No specific observational dates are provided in the context.)  
   - Detector Details / Wavelength(s):  
     Though details are not specified in the text, these instruments typically operate using optical detectors sensitive to wavelengths associated with solar photospheric light and Zeeman splitting for magnetic field measurements.  
   - Physical Observable:  
     Photospheric magnetic field.

3. OMNI Hourly Data Set  
   - General Comments:  
     This data set provides in‐situ solar wind measurements that are used as the target for model forecasting. It compiles measurements from various space‐borne instruments at L1 and is critical for validating solar wind speed predictions.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The solar wind speed is taken from the OMNI hourly data set.”  
   - Time Range:  
     While the OMNI data set itself spans many years, for this study the solar wind speed observations were used from two key periods:  
       • Training Period: May 1992 – October 2006 (approximately 14.5 years)  
       • Testing Period: October 2006 – October 2017 (11 years)  
   - Detector Details / Wavelength(s):  
     The OMNI data set aggregates plasma and magnetic field observations from multiple instruments; specific detector details are not provided in the text.  
   - Physical Observable:  
     Solar wind bulk speed (and associated solar wind parameters).

4. Ulysses Mission  
   - General Comments:  
     Although not a primary instrument for this study’s modeling framework, the Ulysses mission is referenced as having observed the latitudinal invariance of the radial magnetic field. This observational result is used to help justify aspects of the coronal magnetic modeling.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     “The SCS model in the modeling domain between 2.5 and 5 R⊙ accounts for the latitudinal invariance of the radial ﬁeld as observed by the Ulysses mission (Wang & Sheeley, 1995).”  
   - Time Range:  
     (The context does not provide a specific operational time range for Ulysses.)  
   - Detector Details / Wavelength(s):  
     Ulysses carried instruments to measure the in‐situ interplanetary magnetic field and plasma parameters; further detector specifics are not detailed in the provided text.  
   - Physical Observable:  
     Radial magnetic field of the solar wind.
