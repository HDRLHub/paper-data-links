# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the SiRGraF Integrated Tool for Coronal Dynamics (SITCoM), a Python-based software integrated with SunPy for analyzing white-light coronagraph images to study coronal dynamics. The tool uses the Simple Radial Gradient Filter (SiRGraF) to enhance the visibility of dynamic structures in the solar corona, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), plasma blobs, and streamer waves. The paper highlights the tool's functionality in tracking transients, deriving their kinematics through height-time plots, and studying oscillations and waves by fitting sinusoidal functions to distance-time plots. The tool is designed to be user-friendly, allowing for both manual and automatic selection of data points for analysis, and supports saving the output in various formats.

## Instrumentation Details

### LASCO on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is used to observe the white-light solar corona. It captures large-scale eruptions and dynamic events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the solar corona
- **Time Range**: Specific dates mentioned include January 07, 2001, and August 29, 2022.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections, plasma blobs, streamer waves, and other coronal dynamics.
- **Additional Comments**: Data used includes both level 0.5 and level 1 data, processed to correct for image rotation and calibration.

### SECCHI on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Imager) on the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) is utilized for similar purposes as LASCO, providing complementary observations from different viewpoints.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of CMEs and coronal dynamics
- **Time Range**: Specific date mentioned is August 01, 2010.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light imaging
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal mass ejections and associated dynamics.
- **Additional Comments**: Data includes level 0.5 polarized brightness images, processed to level 1 to obtain total brightness images, which are also calibrated and rotation corrected.

### SITCoM Software Tool
- **General Comments**:
   - SITCoM is not a physical instrument but a software tool developed to analyze data from instruments like LASCO and SECCHI. It integrates the SiRGraF algorithm to enhance the visibility of dynamic structures in coronagraph images.

#### Data Processing and Analysis: Software functionality for coronal dynamics analysis
- **Time Range**: Not applicable (software tool)
- **Wavelength(s)**: Applicable to white-light data processed by the tool
- **Physical Observable**: Kinematics of transients (e.g., CMEs, plasma blobs), oscillations, and waves in the solar corona.
- **Additional Comments**: Provides functionalities for generating height-time and distance-time plots, fitting curves to derive kinematics and wave properties, and saving outputs in various formats.
