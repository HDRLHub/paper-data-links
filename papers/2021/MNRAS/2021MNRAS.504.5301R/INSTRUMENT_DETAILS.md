Its gamma‐ray burst monitor (GRBM) operating in the 40–700 keV energy band determined the trigger of the GRB, and two wide‐field cameras operating in the 2–30 keV X‐ray energy band allowed the localization ... This enabled a follow‐up with the narrow‐field instruments (NFI) in the 2–10 keV energy band.”
