## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the study of quasi-periodic variations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) with different angular widths, analyzing their occurrence rates over a 25-year period from January 1, 1996, to August 31, 2021. The research utilizes data from the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) catalog, which is manually maintained and includes detailed records of each CME, such as time, date, angular width, and central position angle. The study identifies various periodicities in CMEs, such as 9 months, 1.7 years, and 3.3-4.3 years, and compares these findings with previous studies. The analysis methods include frequency and time-frequency analysis, specifically Fourier and wavelet spectra. The paper discusses the implications of these periodic variations in understanding the relationships among solar magnetic activity, CMEs, solar flares, and geomagnetic disturbances.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used to observe and record data on coronal mass ejections. The instrument's data, specifically from the CDAW catalog, forms the basis of the study's analysis of CME occurrence rates and periodicities.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full study period for analysis of CMEs with different angular widths
- **Time Range**: January 1, 1996 â€“ August 31, 2021
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the context
- **Physical Observable**: Angular width, central position angle, time, and date of CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: The data includes a total of 31,310 CMEs recorded during the specified period, with gaps filled using linear interpolation. The study classifies CMEs into different types based on angular width and investigates their periodicities.
