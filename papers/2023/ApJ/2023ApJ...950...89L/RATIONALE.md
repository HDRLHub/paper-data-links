**produce the script**. We need to construct Python scripts using the SunPy library to query solar data from different instruments as specified in the context. The context provides detailed information about the instruments and the time periods during which data was collected. We will focus on creating queries for each instrument and time period mentioned, ensuring that the queries are specific to the requirements of the study.

### Script for GME on IMP-8

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for GME on IMP-8
gme_time_range = a.Time('1973-11-01', '2001-10-31')

# Since the specific instrument and detector are not available in VSO via SunPy, we note this:
print("GME data from IMP-8 needs to be accessed from specialized IMP-8 data archives.")

# Example of how it would look if it were available:
# gme_query = Fido.search(gme_time_range, a.Instrument('GME'))

# Print the query result (if it were possible)
# print("Query for GME on IMP-8:")
# print(gme_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data if it were available
# gme_files = Fido.fetch(gme_query)
```

### Script for ERNE on SOHO

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for ERNE on SOHO
erne_time_range = a.Time('2001-10-01', '2006-12-31')

# Query for ERNE data
erne_query = Fido.search(erne_time_range, a.Instrument('ERNE'))

# Print the query result
print("Query for ERNE on SOHO:")
print(erne_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# erne_files = Fido.fetch(erne_query)
```

### Script for SEPEM on GOES

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for SEPEM on GOES
sepem_time_range = a.Time('2001-01-01', '2016-12-31')  # Adjusted to cover the study period

# Since SEPEM is not directly queryable via SunPy's Fido, we note this:
print("SEPEM data from GOES needs to be accessed from specialized GOES data archives or SEPEM reference datasets.")

# Example of how it would look if it were available:
# sepem_query = Fido.search(sepem_time_range, a.Instrument('SEPEM'))

# Print the query result (if it were possible)
# print("Query for SEPEM on GOES:")
# print(sepem_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data if it were available
# sepem_files = Fido.fetch(sepem_query)
```

**Note**: The scripts above are structured to reflect the data used in the context. However, due to limitations in the VSO interface provided by SunPy, some data (like GME on IMP-8 and SEPEM on GOES) might not be directly accessible. For these cases, researchers should access the data through other specialized interfaces or archives as noted in the scripts.
