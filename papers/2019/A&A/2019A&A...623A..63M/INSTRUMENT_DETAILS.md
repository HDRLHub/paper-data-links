## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the complex Type IV radio burst that accompanied an X1.4 solar flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) on 22 September 2011. The study uses data from a range of radio imaging and spectroscopic instruments as well as extreme-ultraviolet and white‐light observations. Key observational periods span from approximately 10:30 UT to 11:10 UT on 22 September 2011. The analysis identifies two distinct components in the Type IV burst – an initial, relatively faint stationary component with gyro‐synchrotron properties and a later, bursty moving component exhibiting high degrees of circular polarisation and power-law spectral decreases suggestive of a coherent emission mechanism (plasma emission or electron cyclotron maser). The multi‐instrument approach, which includes radio imagers, spectrometers, X‐ray monitors, and EUV imagers, is critical in distinguishing spatial, spectral, and temporal variations that point to changes in the underlying emission mechanisms.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The NRH was used to obtain radio images of the Type IV burst at frequencies between 228 and 445 MHz. It provided spatial information on the evolving radio sources, capturing both the extended and compact brightness components associated with the Type IV emission.
   - The instrument enabled flux density measurements and determination of spectral indices by imaging at several discrete times.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "In this paper, we focus mainly on the Type IV radio burst at frequencies of 200–400 MHz because this burst was also observed in radio images from the Nançay Radioheliograph (NRH; Kerdraon & Delouis 1997) at frequencies between 228–445 MHz (Fig. 2)."
