### 1. Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
- **General Comments**:
   - This spacecraft is one of the key 1 AU platforms located between the Earth and the Sun at the 1st Lagrange point. It provides in situ measurements vital for identifying current sheets in the solar wind. The instrument suite includes a magnetometer measuring the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) with one-second resolution together with plasma detectors providing solar wind proton number density, speed, and radial temperature.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Our study is mainly based on an analysis of the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) measurements. We have used the following ACE data for 2004-2010: the IMF vector B measured with the one second resolution, the corresponding <|B|> (the magnetic field magnitude), and the 64-second-resolution plasma data, namely, the solar wind proton number density N, the solar wind bulk speed V, and the radial component of the proton temperature T …”

- **Data Collection Period**:
  
  #### Data Collection Period 1: 2004 – 2010
  - **Time Range**: January 1, 2004 – December 31, 2010 (dates inferred from “2004-2010” usage in the study)
     - **Supporting Quote**: “...the following ACE data for 2004-2010: the IMF vector B measured with the one second resolution…”  
  - **Measurement Details**:
     - **Detectors/Measurement Devices**: 
       - Magnetometer for IMF vector B (including components and magnitude)
       - Plasma instruments recording proton number density (N), solar wind bulk speed (V) and proton temperature (T)
     - **Physical Observables**:
       - Magnetic field (B; including its derivatives for CS identification)
       - Plasma parameters: density, speed, temperature, plasma beta, and derived quantities such as the Alfvén speed (VA)
     - **Additional Comments**:
       - Data cadence: 1-second resolution for IMF measurements and 64-seconds for plasma measurements.
       - The derived one-second cadence facilitates the computation of key derivatives used in the automated identification of current sheets.

### 2. STEREO Spacecraft (STEREO Ahead (A) and STEREO Behind (B))
- **General Comments**:
   - The STEREO mission provides complementary data to ACE by measuring both magnetic field and plasma parameters along Earth's orbit. Although currently only STEREO A remains fully in operation, data from both STEREO A and STEREO B for several-day-long intervals were used during 2007-2010 when both were operating normally.
   - The instruments onboard include magnetometers which capture the IMF with one-second resolution and plasma instruments that monitor solar wind proton number density, speed, and temperature with a 60-second resolution. In addition, the Heliospheric Imagers (HI) onboard STEREO capture white-light images to reconstruct solar wind density structures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The other dataset employed is from the STEREO Ahead (A) and STEREO Behind (B) spacecraft that move nearly along the Earth’s orbit … The STEREO mission data on B with the one second resolution … and the plasma parameters (N, V and T) with the 60 second resolution… Currently, only STEREO A remains operating, but we use the STEREO A and STEREO B data for several-day-long intervals taken in 2007-2010.”

- **Data Collection Period**:
  
  #### Data Collection Period 1: 2007 – 2010 (Selected Intervals)
  - **Time Range**: Specific several-day-long intervals during 2007-2010 (exact dates not fully specified, but within the period when both spacecraft functioned normally)
     - **Supporting Quote**: “...several-day-long intervals taken in 2007-2010 when both spacecraft functioned normally.”
  - **Measurement Details**:
     - **Detectors/Measurement Devices**: 
       - Magnetometer instruments measuring the IMF vector B at one-second resolution.
       - Plasma detectors recording solar wind proton number density (N), bulk speed (V) and temperature (T) at a 60-second resolution.
       - Heliospheric Imagers (HI) that observe the solar wind in white light, facilitating remote reconstruction of solar wind density and tracking of stream interaction regions (SIRs).
     - **Physical Observables**:
       - Magnetic field variations and directional changes used to identify current sheets.
       - Plasma parameters including density, speed, temperature used to derive additional observables such as plasma beta and Alfvén speed (VA).
       - White-light imagery providing density reconstructions for validating SIR evolution.
     - **Additional Comments**:
       - The combination of in situ and remote sensing (via HIs) enhances the ability to validate the automated current sheet identification method.
       - Data resolution differences (1 s for IMF and 60 s for plasma parameters) are taken into account in the post-processing of the current sheet detection criteria.
