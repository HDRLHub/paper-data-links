# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed investigation of how elemental abundances in the solar corona and solar wind are modified by the FIP (First Ionization Potential) effect. It discusses the fractionation processes driven by MHD waves (shear and torsional Alfvén waves) propagating in different magnetic structures (open and closed field regions). In addition, the work outlines several observational strategies and instrument concepts—primarily in the ultraviolet (UV) range—to diagnose these processes. The paper emphasizes the use of both imaging and spectroscopic observations in the FUV and EUV bandpasses and discusses potential instruments that can capture phenomena including spectral line broadening (from ion-cyclotron resonance heating), Doppler shifts, and wave-driven intensity modulations.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Ultraviolet Coronagraph-Spectrometer (UVCS) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - UVCS is an instrument designed for off-limb UV spectroscopy of the solar corona. It has been pivotal in detecting details of ion heating (e.g., the broadening of O⁵⁺ spectral lines) attributed to ion-cyclotron resonant heating, as well as in characterizing spectral line intensities and polarization.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the Ultraviolet Coronagraph-Spectrometer on SOHO (UVCS Kohl et al. 1995, 1997, 2006) was that of significant heating in the O⁵⁺ ion inferred from spectral line broadening...”  
- **Time Ranges**:
   - The paper does not provide an explicit observation start and end time for UVCS observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - UVCS observations focus on the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) region and extend into the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV), as evidenced by the tables of spectral lines covering wavelengths from about 700 Å to over 1600 Å.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...off-limb UV spectroscopy would directly observe the element abundance fractionations...” (Section discussing instrument requirements and Table 2 & Table 3).
- **Physical Observable**:
   - Spectral line intensities, line widths (for diagnosing ion heating), Doppler shifts, and polarization are among the key observables.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “UV spectroscopy can test collisionless theories of multi-ion shock heating as a function of mass-per-charge...” (Section 5.6).

### 2. Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - SUMER is referenced in conjunction with UVCS in the presentation of spectral line data (e.g., in Table 2). It is used to capture detailed solar ultraviolet emission profiles.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - Table 2 is headed “UVCS/SUMER”, indicating that SUMER contributes to the wavelength coverage and spectral diagnostics of the quiet corona.
- **Time Ranges**:
   - As with UVCS, specific observation time ranges are not provided in the text.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Similar to UVCS, SUMER data covers the short-wavelength UV region, with lines in the range of approximately 700 Å to just over 1050 Å.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - SUMER enables measurement of emission line intensities, line shifts, and widths which are used to infer plasma properties and possible wave activity in the corona.

### 3. Spectral Investigation of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) on board Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
   - SPICE is an instrument designed to view the solar disk directly and is intended to study the sources of the solar wind by capturing a subset of EUV spectral lines. Its observations focus on abundance diagnostics, particularly for elements that are key to understanding the solar wind’s origin.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In an alternative approach, the Spectral Investigation of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument on Solar Orbiter (Fludra et al. 2013) views the solar disk directly, in order to study the solar source of the wind...”  
- **Time Ranges**:
   - The provided context does not specify explicit start and end times for SPICE observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - SPICE covers a portion of the EUV bandpass, including key diagnostic lines such as those of S (sulfur) and other elements that vary with the FIP effect.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - SPICE is expected to measure spectral line intensities and ratios, which are crucial for determining the elemental abundances and linking them to the processes of wave-driven fractionation.

### 4. Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST)
- **General Comments**:
   - DKIST is mentioned as an example of a high-throughput ground-based facility that operates at longer wavelengths. It offers increased photon throughput but at the expense of having fewer suitable diagnostic lines compared to the UV.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Higher throughput may be achieved at longer wavelengths, especially from the ground (e.g. the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope; Tritschler et al. 2015)...”
- **Time Ranges**:
   - No specific observation time ranges are provided for DKIST within the context of this paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Operates at longer wavelengths relative to the UV; the exact wavelength range is not detailed, though it is noted that the longer wavelengths have reduced diagnostic line availability for the specific purposes discussed in the paper.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - While not expanded in detail, DKIST’s context implies capabilities in imaging and spectroscopic diagnostics (e.g., for observations of solar phenomena including waves and abundance variations) from the ground.

### 5. Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP)
- **General Comments**:
   - CoMP is an instrument that has been used to detect low-frequency, 5-minute Alfvénic waves in the solar corona, particularly in the context of measuring Doppler shifts and line-of-sight (l.o.s.) oscillations.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Recently, 5-minute Alfvénic waves have been detected with the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP; Tomczyk et al. 2007) at low heights where the plasma is collisional...”
- **Time Ranges**:
   - The text does not report specific start or end times for the CoMP observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - The exact wavelengths observed by CoMP are not specified in the provided context; however, its primary measurements relate to spectral line profiles (such as those of H I Lyα) used for detecting wave properties.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - CoMP is used to observe Doppler shifts, oscillations in line centroids, and line widths, which are diagnostic of Alfvénic wave activity and turbulence in the corona.

*Note on Time Ranges*:  
While the instructions call for time range details (start and end times) for each instrument’s data collection period, none of the instruments mentioned in the provided context have explicit observation date ranges or time stamps. The paper instead focuses on spatial (altitude, heliocentric distance) and integration time estimates (e.g., 375 s to cross a slit) rather than specific clock times or calendar dates.
