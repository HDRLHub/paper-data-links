## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a detailed investigation of the spectral properties of band splitting type II radio bursts and their association with sunspot numbers, focusing on observations from 2010 to 2017 during solar cycle 24. The study utilized data from the CALLISTO spectrometer network to analyze the frequency range of 20MHz to 200MHz. Key findings include synchronization of type II shock height, magnetic field strength, CME/shock speed, and Alfvén speed with the trajectory of solar cycle 24. The study also revealed a strong correlation between the estimated CME/shock speeds from dynamic spectra and the associated CME speeds from SOHO/LASCO, as well as between the absolute drift rates and the plasma frequency. The research underscores the importance of monitoring the physical conditions of band splitting type II radio bursts for space weather forecasting.
