## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the ensemble modeling of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their interplanetary counterparts (ICMEs) to predict their arrival times and velocities at Earth. The study employs the Drag-Based Model (DBM) and aims to refine the statistical distributions of the model's input parameters, specifically the drag parameter and solar wind speed. The research utilizes a new CME-ICME database created from multiple observational sources, including LASCO coronagraphs and in situ data, to measure initial CME positions and speeds and associate them with arrival dates and speeds at Earth. The paper also discusses the limitations of current forecasting methods and suggests improvements based on the new empirical data.

## Instrumentation Details

### LASCO Coronagraphs on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) is used to observe CMEs and measure their initial positions and speeds. The data from LASCO is crucial for determining the kinematic properties of CMEs at their launch time.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We employ LASCO coronagraph observations to measure initial CME position and speed, and in situ data to associate them with an arrival date and arrival speed."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General CME observations
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – Present
   - **Supporting Quote**: "From about 500 events from May 1996 to present in this catalog, we consider only those events that have information about the CME liftoff time, selecting 247 events."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: CME position and speed
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The SOHO/LASCO catalog provides various kinematic properties associated to the onset time t0LASCO of the CMEs (i.e. position angle, angular width, Mass, see Tab. 1)."
- **Additional Comments**: The LASCO data is used in conjunction with other databases to create a comprehensive CME-ICME dataset.

### OMNI Database (In situ data)
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI database provides in situ measurements of solar wind parameters and magnetic fields at L1, which are used to determine the arrival times and speeds of ICMEs at Earth.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We start from the list of near-Earth interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) compiled by Richardson and Cane (2010, hereafter R&C, 2010), who maintain the catalog using data from the OMNI database (Goddard Space Flight Center, GSFC, http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: General ICME observations
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – Present
   - **Supporting Quote**: "From about 500 events from May 1996 to present in this catalog, we consider only those events that have information about the CME liftoff time, selecting 247 events."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: ICME arrival time and speed
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We therefore need a database associating Earth ToA and SoA of an ICME to the kinematic characteristics of the corresponding CME."
- **Additional Comments**: The OMNI database is essential for correlating CME observations with their interplanetary effects.

### Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK)
- **General Comments**:
   - HEK is used to retrieve information about solar features such as filaments, flares, active regions, and coronal holes that may be associated with CMEs.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Lastly, information about features and events on the Sun that may be associated to the CME, such as Filaments, Flares, Active Regions, and Coronal Holes are retrieved from the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (Hurlburt et al., 2010; Martens et al., 2012, HEK): a queryable repository of feature and event information about the Sun."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar feature associations
- **Time Range**: Not specified
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Solar features (filaments, flares, active regions, coronal holes)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "To find the most probable CME source on the Sun, we employed a source finding algorithm that makes use of HEK (Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase - Hurlburt et al., 2010) to query which solar features (Active Regions, Solar Flares, Filaments Eruptions) that may have been the source of the CME, are within an area A and a time span ∆t compatible with the CME launch parameters."
- **Additional Comments**: HEK data helps in identifying the source regions of CMEs on the solar disk.

### STEREO Spacecraft (Occasional use)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) provides additional observations of CMEs, particularly when LASCO data is not available.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In a few cases, STEREO spacecraft observations are used."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Supplementary CME observations
- **Time Range**: Not specified
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: CME position and speed
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In a few cases, STEREO spacecraft observations are used."
- **Additional Comments**: STEREO data is used to complement LASCO observations when necessary.
