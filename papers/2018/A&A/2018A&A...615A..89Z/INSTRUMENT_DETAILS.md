## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the spatial relationship between a coronal shock, a coronal mass ejection (CME), and associated type II radio burst observed on October 26, 2013. The primary data sources are tied-array imaging and spectroscopy from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), white-light coronagraph observations from SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-A/COR2A, and a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the ambient corona constrained by photospheric magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI. The observational and modeling analyses combine high-cadence radio and coronagraph data to reconstruct the CME and type II radio burst in 3D, including the period 09:31:10 UT to 09:32:58 UT, with all contextual information tied to the event SOL2013-10-26. LOFAR provides detailed positional and spectral information on the radio emissions, SOHO and STEREO deliver multi-viewpoint reconstructions of the CME, and SDO/HMI supplies the magnetic boundary conditions for MHD modeling. These elements are integral to the paper’s principal findings regarding the origin, location, and physical context of the observed radio emissions.

## Instrumentation Details

### LOFAR (Low Band Antennas) on board the Low Frequency Array
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for high time- and frequency-resolution beam-formed observations of the solar radio type II burst and its spatial mapping; operational at 10–90 MHz during the event; provides both dynamic spectra and positional information for the radio sources forming the basis of analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "On 2013 October 26, a type II radio burst was recorded using one of the LOFAR beam-formed modes (Stappers et al. 2011; van Haarlem et al. 2013). The radio burst was observed with the Low Band Antennas (LBAs) operating at frequencies of 10–90 MHz using six stations at the heart of the core combined to eﬀectively form a single large station, a 320 m diameter island referred to as the Superterp."
