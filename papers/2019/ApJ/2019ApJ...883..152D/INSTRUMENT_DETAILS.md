## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the three-dimensional density structure of a solar coronal streamer by forward-modeling its brightness profiles as observed in white-light by different coronagraphs. Two main instruments are used: the white-light coronagraphs aboard STEREO (specifically, the COR2 instrument on STEREO A) and SOHO (the LASCO suite, including C2 and C3). The study makes use of both total brightness (unpolarized) and polarized brightness (pB) images to derive the electron density distribution in the streamer. Observations from April 30, 2011 (with precise UT times provided for each image), when the spacecraft were in quadrature, allow the authors to capture nearly simultaneous edge-on and face-on views of the streamer. Additional data from the MLSO/Mk4 coronagraph were inspected for comparison though no corresponding structures could be identified.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. STEREO A / COR2 Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - The COR2 coronagraph aboard STEREO A provides white-light observations that capture the Thomson-scattered light from free electrons in the solar corona. In this study, COR2 images are used both in total (unpolarized) brightness and in polarized brightness (pB) to achieve an edge-on view of the streamer.
   - The instrument offers an ideal vantage point for three-dimensional reconstructions when combined with observations from SOHO/LASCO.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “On April 30, 2011 a clear streamer structure was observed above the south-east limb by the COR2 coronagraph aboard STEREO A…”  
   - “The first set of images used in this study was taken at 16:24:00 UT by COR2 using so-called ‘double’ (i.e. total brightness) exposure…”  

#### Data Collection Period 1: Total Brightness Observations
- **Time Range**: 16:24:00 UT on April 30, 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...taken at 16:24:00 UT by COR2…”  
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (broadband visible light capturing Thomson scattering)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the brightness inferred from the solar corona in white-light observations is mainly the result of Thomson scattering of photospheric light on free electrons in the corona.”
- **Physical Observable**: Total brightness (intensity) of the K corona, representative of electron density along the line-of-sight.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...our model will be fitted to intensity values, which correspond in turn to the line-of-sight integration of electron density values.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Polarized Brightness (pB) Observations
- **Time Range**: 16:08:15 UT, 16:08:45 UT and 16:09:15 UT on April 30, 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the pB image sequence from COR2 at 16:08:15 UT, 16:08:45 UT and 16:09:15 UT…”  
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (with an emphasis on polarization due to Thomson scattering)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...electron density inversion methods have also been widely used with polarized brightness (pB) images...”
- **Physical Observable**: Polarized brightness which is used to infer the electron density by relying on the fact that the F corona is largely unpolarized below ~5 R⊙.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the F corona is unpolarized below approximately 5 R⊙ (Quémérais & Lamy 2002)…”

### 2. SOHO / LASCO Coronagraphs (C2 and C3)
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO suite aboard SOHO consists of multiple coronagraphs. In this paper, LASCO C2 and C3 are used to provide a face-on view of the streamer. Their white-light observations capture both total brightness and polarized brightness, with the latter used to infer electron densities below 5 R⊙.
   - LASCO images benefit from high cadence in total brightness observations, making them suitable for capturing dynamic features in the corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...with the LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs, we have the view rotated by approximately 90◦... which we will refer to as the face-on view.”
   - “...at 16:23:04 UT by LASCO C2 and at 16:17:04 UT by LASCO C3. These are total brightness images.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Total Brightness Observations
- **Time Range**:
   - LASCO C2: 16:23:04 UT on April 30, 2011  
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...at 16:23:04 UT by LASCO C2…”
   - LASCO C3: 16:17:04 UT on April 30, 2011  
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...at 16:17:04 UT by LASCO C3.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (sensitive to the visible range where Thomson scattering occurs)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...brightness of the white-light corona…”
- **Physical Observable**: Total brightness related to the K corona’s intensity, providing a measure of the line-of-sight integrated electron density.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the data needs to be correctly pre-processed and calibrated to separate the K corona from the F corona and straylight.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Polarized Brightness (pB) Observations
- **Time Range**: LASCO C2 pB image sequence at 14:54:08 UT, 14:57:58 UT, and 15:01:48 UT on April 30, 2011  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the pB image sequence for LASCO C2 at 14:54:08 UT, 14:57:58 UT and 15:01:48 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (with polarization analysis to better isolate electron scattering signals)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...observations of the solar corona in white-light...using polarized brightness (pB) images…”
- **Physical Observable**: Polarized brightness used to derive the electron density, particularly effective in regions below 5 R⊙ where the F corona’s contribution is minimal.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the K corona can thus be directly inferred from pB images in the regions below 5 R⊙.”

### 3. MLSO / Mk4 Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - The MLSO/Mk4 coronagraph was checked as a possible intermediate field-of-view instrument connecting those of LASCO C2 and disk EUV imagers. However, no structures corresponding to the ray-like features observed in the LASCO C2 field of view were identified in the MLSO/Mk4 data.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We checked the data taken by the MLSO/Mk4 coronagraph (that has the ﬁeld of view connecting those of LASCO C2 and disk EUV imagers, see e.g. Elmore et al. 2003) but could not identify any structures corresponding to rays we observed in the C2 ﬁeld of view.”
- **Data Collection Period**:  
   - **Time Range**: No specific time range details provided in the paper.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:  
   - The instrument operates as a white-light coronagraph but no detailed wavelength, detector or observational parameter information is provided.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implied through the mention of CORONAGRAPH data; no direct quote pertains to its observational parameters.)
