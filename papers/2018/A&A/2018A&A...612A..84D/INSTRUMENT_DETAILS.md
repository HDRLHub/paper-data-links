## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study aims to map the solar wind outflow velocity of neutral hydrogen (H I) atoms in the inner heliosphere by analyzing simultaneous visible-light (VL) and ultraviolet (UV) coronagraphic observations. Data was directly acquired from three instruments: the UVCS spectrometer and the LASCO C2 coronagraph aboard SOHO, and the ground-based Mk3 K-Coronameter at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO). The selected observation period covers a full Carrington rotation from 1997-06-01 to 1997-06-28—a complete 28-day solar rotation during solar minimum. Specifically, the UVCS daily synoptic Lyα line rasters, LASCO C2 polarised brightness images, and Mk3 polarised brightness images were processed to derive daily full-corona maps of H I outflow velocity between heliocentric distances of 1.5 and 4.0 R⊙. These data form the basis for electron density reconstructions, syntheses of expected Lyα intensity, and application of the Doppler dimming technique to obtain velocity maps—integral to the scientific findings. The study includes a parameter sensitivity analysis on the derived outflow velocities, directly leveraging these datasets.

### UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - UVCS provided the primary ultraviolet spectroscopic data (Lyα line) directly analyzed to reconstruct outflow velocity maps and for calibration of the Doppler dimming technique.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We used polarised brightness images acquired by the LASCO/SOHO and Mk3/MLSO coronagraphs, and synoptic Lyα line observations of the UVCS/SOHO spectrometer to obtain daily maps of solar wind H I outﬂow velocity between 1.5 and 4.0 R⊙on the SOHO plane of the sky during a complete solar rotation (from 1997 June 1 to 1997 June 28)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Daily Synoptic Observations of H I Lyα Line
- **Time Range**: 1997-06-01 – 1997-06-28 (full Carrington rotation and event context: solar minimum)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We selected data over a time interval of 28 days in June 1997, covering a complete solar rotation, and reconstructed UV and VL full-corona images in the range of heliocentric distances between 1.5 and 6.0 R⊙."
- **Wavelength(s)**: H I Lyα 121.6 ± 10 nm
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "synoptic Lyα line observations of the UVCS/SOHO spectrometer"
- **Physical Observable**: H I Lyα intensity, used to derive solar wind outflow velocity
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The UVCS synoptic observations were acquired each day over a time interval of about 10–12 h, though unevenly spaced in time, and can be considered as representative of the average Lyα line emission of the scanned solar corona over the whole day."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - UVCS synoptic data were used to reconstruct daily maps in the 1.5–3.5 R⊙ range and interpolated across all latitudes for full-coverage maps.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO) C2 on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO C2 provided visible-light polarised brightness (pB) images directly analyzed for electron density derivation, key to the synthesis of Lyα intensity and velocity retrievals.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We combined the LASCO C2 pB images with those acquired by the ground-based Mk3 of the MLSO, whose FOV goes from 1.12 to 2.44 R⊙, in order to better cover the coronal region at lower heliocentric distance."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Daily Polarised Brightness Imaging
- **Time Range**: 1997-06-01 – 1997-06-28 (matching/daily coverage with UVCS, during solar minimum/rotation context)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We only selected the pB image temporally closer to the UVCS daily synoptic for simulating the simultaneous UV and VL imaging that will be performed by Metis."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 580–640 nm (broad-band visible-light)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "...will acquire for the ﬁrst time simultaneous coronagraphic images of the inner heliosphere in broad-band (580–640 nm) polarised visible-light (VL)..."
- **Physical Observable**: Polarised brightness (pB), related to coronal electron density
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Since the coronal polarised brightness is only depending on the electron density through some geometrical factors (Billings 1966; Van De Hulst 1950), we used the sequence of reconstructed pB images to determine radial proﬁles of ne by means of the Van De Hulst inversion (Van De Hulst 1950)."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - LASCO C2 observations cover 2.5–6.5 R⊙, merged with Mk3 for comprehensive radial coverage.

### Mark-III K-Coronameter (Mk3) at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Mk3 acquired visible-light pB images, merged with LASCO C2 to enable electron density reconstruction at lower altitudes (1.12–2.44 R⊙), essential for the VL dataset required in electron density and velocity mapping.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We combined the LASCO C2 pB images with those acquired by the ground-based Mk3 of the MLSO, whose FOV goes from 1.12 to 2.44 R⊙, in order to better cover the coronal region at lower heliocentric distance."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Daily Polarised Brightness Imaging
- **Time Range**: 1997-06-01 – 1997-06-28 (co-registered/SOHO-matched period, solar minimum context)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The VL polarised brightness images acquired by LASCO and Mk3 were selected, accordingly, to minimise the time gap with the UV observations."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible-light (bandpass not numerically specified in text, but broad VL is implied, see above)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We combined the LASCO C2 pB images with those acquired by the ground-based Mk3 of the MLSO, whose FOV goes from 1.12 to 2.44 R⊙, in order to better cover the coronal region at lower heliocentric distance."
- **Physical Observable**: Polarised brightness (pB), for electron density derivation  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Combined the LASCO C2 pB images with those acquired by the ground-based Mk3 of the MLSO, whose FOV goes from 1.12 to 2.44 R⊙, in order to better cover the coronal region at lower heliocentric distance."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Mk3 pB images were interpolated and combined with LASCO C2 data for a reconstructed dataset spanning 1.5–6.0 R⊙ used in all calculations.
