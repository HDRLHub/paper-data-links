```python
import sunpy.net.Fido as Fido
import sunpy.net.attrs as a
from sunpy.time import parse_time
import astropy.units as u

# Define the time ranges for the two phases
time_range1 = a.Time(parse_time("2011-06-07 05:40"), parse_time("2011-06-07 06:22"))
time_range2 = a.Time(parse_time("2011-06-07 06:22"), parse_time("2011-06-07 08:00"))

# Define the instrument and wavelength
instrument = a.Instrument('AIA')
wavelength = a.Wavelength(193 * u.Angstrom)

# Construct the query for the initial eruption and rising phase
query1 = Fido.search(time_range1, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query Results for Initial Eruption and Rising Phase:")
print(query1)

# Construct the query for the falling phase
query2 = Fido.search(time_range2, instrument, wavelength)
print("Query Results for Falling Phase:")
print(query2)

# Uncomment the following lines to fetch the data
# files1 = Fido.fetch(query1)
# files2 = Fido.fetch(query2)
```

### Explanation
- **Imports**: Import necessary modules from SunPy and Astropy.
- **Time Ranges**: Define the time ranges for the two phases using `parse_time` to ensure correct time format.
- **Instrument and Wavelength**: Define the instrument (AIA) and the wavelength (193 Ã…).
- **Queries**: Construct two separate queries for the two time ranges.
- **Print Results**: Print the results of each query to verify the data.
- **Fetch Command**: The fetch commands are commented out but provided for future use.

This script is explicit, well-commented, and directly reflects the data requirements specified in the context.
