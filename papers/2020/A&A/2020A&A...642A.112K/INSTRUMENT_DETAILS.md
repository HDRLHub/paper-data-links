## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed comparison of soft X-ray spectra observed by the RESIK instrument onboard the Coronas‐F spacecraft and hard X-ray observations from the RHESSI satellite during the M1.8 GOES class solar flare on 20 September 2002. The study uses these observational data together with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic (1D-HD) model to reconstruct differential emission measure (DEM) distributions and synthetic spectra, and to cross-calibrate between instruments. In addition to RESIK and RHESSI data, the study also employs observations from the GOES X-ray monitors and the SOHO/EIT telescope for loop geometry determination and contextual imaging. Detailed time intervals for data collection and spectral ranges (e.g. RESIK channels spanning 3.33–6.15 Å, RHESSI energy bands from 3 keV to several hundred keV, GOES 1–8 Å and 0.5–4 Å, and SOHO/EIT at 195 Å) mark the observational basis of the modelling.

## 1. RESIK on board Coronas‐F
- **General Comments**:
   - RESIK is a high-resolution Bragg crystal spectrometer designed to observe soft X-ray (SXR) spectra from solar active regions and flares. It operates in the nominal energy/wavelength range of 3.33 Å – 6.15 Å.
   - The instrument uses bent thin wafers (0.5 mm and 1 mm) of silicon and quartz monocrystals as dispersive elements, which allow simultaneous recording of the whole spectral range without scanning motions.
   - RESIK observations contribute key spectral data enabling the reconstruction of differential emission measures (DEMs) and cross-calibration with RHESSI.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “RESIK (Sylwester et al. 2005a) was a high-resolution crystal spectrometer operating in the nominal energy range 2.01 keV – 3.72 keV (3.33 Å – 6.15 Å). It was built ... and observed the whole Sun from 2001 to 2003 on board the Coronas‐F spacecraft.”  
- **Data Collection Periods**:

   #### Data Collection Period 1: Primary Analysis Interval

## 2. RHESSI on board the RHESSI Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI is an X-ray and gamma-ray spectrometer designed to observe solar flare emissions over a wide energy range from 3 keV to 17 MeV.
   - The instrument features nine coaxial germanium detectors and employs subcollimators (such as 2F, 3F, 4F, 5F, 6F, 8F, and 9F) for high-resolution imaging using algorithms like PIXON.
   - RHESSI plays a key role in determining the parameters of the non-thermal electron (NTE) beams and in cross-calibrating its spectra with RESIK.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The flare on 20 September 2002 was recorded by the RHESSI satellite ... RHESSI observed X-ray emission from the whole Sun over a wide energy range (3 keV – 17 MeV) with high temporal and energy resolutions as well as with high signal sensitivity, using nine coaxial germanium detectors.”
- **Data Collection Periods**:

   #### Data Collection Period 1: Impulsive Phase and Imaging
   - **Time Range**: Multiple intervals in the impulsive phase; note the following key intervals:
       - Hard X-ray (HXR) emission (≥25 keV) started at 09:25:24 UT.
       - Two HXR maxima occurred around 09:26 UT and 09:27 UT.
       - A small 25–50 keV emission spike recorded between 09:24:16 UT and 09:24:32 UT.
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The impulsive phase of the ﬂare recorded by RHESSI in X-rays ≥25 keV started at 09:25:24 UT and had two maxima around 09:26 UT and 09:27 UT. In the 25 - 50 keV energy range, a small spike of emission was recorded between 09:24:16 UT and 09:24:32 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)/Energy Range**:
       - Imaging performed in energy bands of 6–12 keV, 25–35 keV, among others.
       - **Supporting Quote**: “Images ... were reconstructed using RHESSI data collected with subcollimators 2F, 3F, 4F, 5F, 6F, 8F, and 9F, integrated over 8 s periods ...”
   - **Physical Observable**: Hard X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons as well as thermal soft X-ray emission (recorded below 25 keV).
   - **Additional Comments**: The quality of RHESSI data is affected below 6 keV, and the instrument does not record significant thermal emission below 3 keV.

## 3. GOES X-ray Monitors on Board GOES Satellites
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES satellites are equipped with X-ray sensors (XRS) that continuously record full-disc integrated solar X-ray emission in two broad bands.
   - These instruments contribute vital monitoring of the soft X-ray flux, which is used to control energy budgets and validate the hydrodynamic modelling.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The X-ray emission of the ﬂare was also recorded with the GOES X-ray monitors. On each GOES satellite there are two X-ray sensors (XRSs) that continuously record full-disc integrated X-ray emission in two energy bands, 1 Å – 8 Å and 0.5 Å – 4 Å, with 3 s temporal resolution.”

     - **Supporting Quote**: “The soft X-ray emission (1 – 8 Å) of the ﬂare recorded by GOES started to rise at 09:18:15 UT and continued till 10:00 UT.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**:
       - 1 Å – 8 Å channel (primary SXR emission monitoring)
       - 0.5 Å – 4 Å channel (started rising simultaneously but peaked at 09:27:30 UT)
     - **Supporting Quote**: “The rise in the higher-energy channel (0.5 – 4 Å) emission started simultaneously but peaked one minute earlier at 09:27:30 UT.”
   - **Physical Observable**: Integrated soft X-ray flux that traces the temperature and emission measure of the flare plasma, providing a reference for energy budget constraining in the model.

## 4. SOHO/EIT on board the SOHO Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the SOHO spacecraft delivers full-disc images of the Sun in multiple EUV wavelengths.
