## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of the extreme gamma‐ray flare GRB 200415A, interpreted as a magnetar giant flare in the Sculptor galaxy (NGC 253). The study makes use of data provided by several gamma‐ray instruments from diverse spacecraft that detect the burst from different vantage points. Key observations include high time resolution light curves (down to 2 ms in some cases) and multichannel spectral measurements covering energy ranges from tens of keV up to GeV. The detailed temporal and spectral properties (including sharply rising millisecond‐scale pulses and exponentially decaying tails) support the magnetar giant flare interpretation. The paper discusses the roles and complementary capabilities of instruments such as Konus‐Wind, Fermi‐GBM, Swift‐BAT, INTEGRAL’s detectors, Mars‐Odyssey’s HEND, as well as auxiliary observations by Fermi‐LAT and the MXGS on the International Space Station.
