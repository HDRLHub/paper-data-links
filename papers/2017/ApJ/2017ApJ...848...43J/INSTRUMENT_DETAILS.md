## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study of ultraviolet (UV), X-ray, and Ca II S-index observations of old (7.0 ± 0.3 Gyr) solar analogs 16 Cyg A and B, with additional comparison to younger solar-type stars including 18 Sco, the Sun, α Cen A, and τ Cet. The primary research objectives are to analyze the properties of UV emission lines and their variability with stellar age, and to investigate the minimal activity states of older solar-type stars. Direct data are obtained via new observations with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for both 16 Cyg A (October 23, 2015) and 16 Cyg B (February 3, 2016), and with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (ACIS-I instrument) for 16 Cyg A, B, and C (February 7, 2016). Archival HST/COS data for 18 Sco (February 4, 2011) are also processed, and S-index time-series in Ca II are extracted from the Lowell Observatory Solar-Stellar Spectrograph (2008–2016). UV and X-ray datasets provide the main basis for the study's findings, including emission line fluxes, profiles, and comparisons across the sample. The paper focuses on wavelengths ranging from 115–177.5 nm (UV, using COS), with specific lines of C II, Si III, N V, Si IV, O V, and He II examined, and X-ray energies from 0.3 to 2.5 keV.

### Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for direct UV spectroscopy of 16 Cyg A, 16 Cyg B (targeted new observations), and 18 Sco (archival data). Data include measurements of surface flux densities of important transition region and chromospheric lines, with high-resolution line profiles forming the basis of UV variability and activity analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: "COS observations were acquired under program 13861 (E. Guinan, P.I.). The circumstances of these observations are given in Table 2 and these epochs are marked in Figure 1. These data were processed using Version 3.3 of the IDL procedure COADD X1D1 using default parameters. We used HST data for stars other than these and 18 Sco, processed and described by Judge et al. (2004). ... G130M Data for 18 Sco were downloaded from the MAST archive and processed as for the 16 Cygni stars."

### Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) on board Chandra X-ray Observatory
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for direct, contemporaneous X-ray observation of 16 Cyg A, 16 Cyg B, and 16 Cyg C (M4.5V companion), providing coronal activity diagnostic in the soft X-ray band (0.3–2.5 keV) precisely around the time of HST UV observations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For 16 Cyg A and B, X-ray activity measures have been acquired by us. In addition to the HST observations of 16 Cyg A and B, contemporaneous X-ray observations were carried out with Chandra on 7 Feb, 2016. ... X-ray observations were obtained using the ACIS-I instrument for a total exposure time of 73.9 ksec. The data were reprocessed using CIAO v4.9 and reduced in the usual fashion. X-ray observations were secured for both 16 Cyg A and B, along with 16 Cyg C, the close (≈3.6” separation) M4.5V companion."

#### Data Collection Period 1: X-ray monitoring of 16 Cyg A, 16 Cyg B, 16 Cyg C
- **Time Range**: 2016-02-07 (single-continuous, 73.9 ksec exposure, closely matched to HST/COS UV observations)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "contemporaneous X-ray observations were carried out with Chandra on 7 Feb, 2016. ... X-ray observations were obtained using the ACIS-I instrument for a total exposure time of 73.9 ksec."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.3–2.5 keV (X-ray band)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In the ACIS-I energy range of 0.3-2.5 keV, the total counts for 16 Cyg A, B, C are just 43, 3, and 6 respectively, the background noise is ≈1 count."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal X-ray flux, total counts, and MEKAL plasma model fitting for coronal temperature and luminosity
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In order to estimate thermal coronal properties, single temperature MEKAL plasma models (Mewe et al. 1995; Drake et al. 1996) were fitted to the energy distributions using the Sherpa modeling and fitting package, the results are listed in Table 3."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Data are directly analyzed for fluxes, temperatures, and compared to known coronal minima and previous upper limits.
    - **Supporting Quote**: "The X-ray fluxes of 16 Cyg B more than an order of magnitude below 16 Cyg A. The results for B and C are less secure than for A. For component B it should be considered an upper limit. This upper limit to LX lies among the lowest measured so far, for a solar-type star."

### Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Used for disk-center intensity reference for the Sun in transition region emission lines, to compare with stellar HST/COS flux spectra and assess center-to-limb effects. Data specifically from April 20, 1997, are used for this comparison.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The solar data are from a typical region, averaging data from along SUMER’s 1 × 300” slit. This region samples just 0.01% of the solar area, extending over a region covering cos ϑ ≈1 to 0.988, where ϑ is the angle between local vertical on the Sun and line-of-sight. ... The solar UV flux spectra of comparable resolution to stellar data exist, but they are badly needed for comparison with stellar data. Center-to-limb (C-L) variations are re-evaluated for lines such as Ca II through to X-rays, with important consequences for observing activity cycles in such features."
- **Time Range**: 1997-04-20 (disk center observation; used as reference comparison for HST stellar data)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The solar measurements are also from a period close to a minimum S-index, but these measurements are from quiet regions close to disk-center only. ... The solar UV data were obtained close to solar minimum on April 20, 1997."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Transition region lines (e.g., 117–140 nm range referenced in Figure 6 and associated text)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The panel labeled 'O V]' in Figure 3 contains broad emission in the wing of H I Lα 121.5 nm, with significant contamination from the geocorona in the COS data shown."
- **Physical Observable**: Disk center intensity spectra in UV; used as a benchmark for comparing HST/COS stellar flux spectra, particularly in emission lines of the transition region.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We emphasize that the solar data shown are intensity data, i.e. from a small, resolved part of the solar disk. The stellar data are flux spectra."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for absolute intensity comparison and analysis of center-to-limb variations and their impact on derived stellar fluxes.

- **Supporting Quote**: "Note that data for α Cen A are from the STIS instrument."
- **Time Range**:
  - α Cen A: (No explicit observation date given in the main text for STIS; but these data are directly used for emission line profile analysis)
  - τ Cet: August 1, 2000
    - **Supporting Quote**: "STIS data for τ Cet were obtained on August 1 2000."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 115–170 nm (includes comparison to COS for similar transition region lines)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Note that data for α Cen A are from the STIS instrument."
- **Physical Observable**: UV emission line profiles for transition region diagnostics; directly compared to COS data for line widths, fluxes, and profile shape.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The data for α Cen A are from the STIS instrument for which deconvolution is not necessary. ... STIS data for α Cen A, the broad components of lines of Si IV amounted to ≈1/4 of the total emission."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - α Cen A STIS spectra serve as a critical comparison point for identifying broad components possibly related to explosive events, using high-fidelity line profiles.
