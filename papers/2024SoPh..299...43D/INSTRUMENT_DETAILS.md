# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that occurred on 16 June 2010 and 14 June 2011. The study utilizes simultaneous coronagraph images from the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) to estimate the three-dimensional speed and acceleration-time profiles of these CMEs. By applying the Flux Rope Internal State (FRIS) model, the paper calculates dynamic and thermodynamic parameters, assessing the validity of self-similar evolution assumptions and comparing observed quantities near the Sun and at 1 AU. The findings highlight differences in the kinematic properties and evolution of the two CMEs, which influence the internal forces and thermodynamic properties.
