## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the perihelion behavior of the interstellar object 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua) by searching for its signature in archived space-based coronagraph images. The authors use nondetections from two spacecraft—SOHO and STEREO—to constrain the physical properties of ‘Oumuamua, particularly its dust coma cross‐section, water production rate, and the resulting nongravitational acceleration. The analysis focuses on observations around early September 2017, with one set of images obtained before and around perihelion and another set taken during the object’s transit across the fields-of-view (FOV) of the two instruments. The data from these instruments, which operate at distinct wavelengths and use different detectors, are used to set upper limits on brightness (apparent V-band magnitudes) and to estimate important parameters such as the effective scattering cross-section.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SOHO – LASCO C3 Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument is part of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and is used to continuously monitor the Sun and its vicinity from the L1 Lagrangian point. In this study, only the C3 coronagraph is employed.
   - The C3 camera produces full-resolution images with a dimension of 1024×1024 pixels and a pixel scale of 56.′′1 per pixel. Its annular fields-of-view extend from 3.7 to 30 solar radii (or approximately 1.0°–8.0°).
   - Although the camera is equipped with four different filters (blue: 4200–5200 Å, clear: 4000–8500 Å, orange: 5400–6400 Å, and red: 7300–8350 Å), the study focuses solely on the clear filter images because nearly all images were acquired in that band.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “It subsequently went into the FOV of C3 on 2017 September 04 and exited on September 08, during which a total of 360 images (each having equivalent exposure time of 20 s) were taken.”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: C3 Coronagraph Observations Around Perihelion
- **Time Range**: 2017 September 04 – 2017 September 08  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...‘Oumuamua went into the FOV of C3 on 2017 September 04 and exited on September 08, during which a total of 360 images (each having equivalent exposure time of 20 s) were taken.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Primarily clear filter bandpass, 4000–8500 Å  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The camera uses four diﬀerent ﬁlters (blue: 4200–5200 Å, clear: 4000–8500 Å, orange: 5400–6400 Å, and red: 7300–8350 Å), though we only consider the clear filter images because virtually all images were acquired in that bandpass…”
- **Physical Observable**: Apparent brightness (V-band magnitude) and effective scattering cross-section of any dust coma  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “For instance, if ‘Oumuamua was completely inactive… its apparent magnitude would be mV ≳10.6 (JPL Horizons) which are well below the detection limits of the two spacecraft.”
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The low resolution and severe field distortion (particularly evident in C3 images) limited the use of some registration techniques for photometric calibration.

### 2. STEREO-A – COR2 Coronagraph (COR2-A)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO consists of twin spacecraft following Earth-like orbits. In this study, only STEREO-A’s COR2 coronagraph (denoted COR2-A) is used, as STEREO-B is no longer communicating.
   - COR2-A is equipped with 2048×2048 CCD arrays with a full-resolution image scale of 14.′′7 per pixel. The instrument continuously monitors regions from 2.5 to 15 solar radii (approx. 0.7°–4.0°) from the Sun and uses a bandpass of 6500–7500 Å.
   - The high sensitivity of COR2-A to forward-scattered light makes it especially useful for detecting dust comae under extreme scattering conditions.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “‘Oumuamua entered the FOV of COR2-A on 2017 September 01 and stayed inside the FOV for nearly 35 hr before egress…”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: COR2-A Coronagraph Observations Around Perihelion
- **Time Range**: Starting on 2017 September 01 with a continuous observing window of nearly 35 hours (approximately from 2017 September 01 to around 2017 September 02; the exact end UT is estimated based on duration)  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “‘Oumuamua entered the FOV of COR2-A on 2017 September 01 and stayed inside the FOV for nearly 35 hr before egress.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 6500–7500 Å  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The camera uses 2048×2048 CCD arrays and continuously observes regions 2.5–15 R⊙ (0.◦7–4.◦0) from the Sun, with a full-resolution image scale of 14.′′7 pixel−1 and a bandpass of 6500–7500 Å.”
- **Physical Observable**: Total brightness as measured by the integrated flux in the images, used to derive the apparent V-band magnitude (mV ≳13.0 ± 0.1) and to constrain the effective scattering cross-section of any dust coma  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In order to quantify the apparent faintness of ‘Oumuamua during the STEREO observations… we obtained the apparent magnitude of ‘Oumuamua to be mV ≳13.0 ± 0.1.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The forward-scattering geometry at large phase angles (α ≳169°) during the STEREO observations was critical in imposing stringent constraints on any dust coma, despite ‘Oumuamua not being directly detected.
   - A total of 107 images were taken during this period, each with an equivalent exposure time of 6 s.
