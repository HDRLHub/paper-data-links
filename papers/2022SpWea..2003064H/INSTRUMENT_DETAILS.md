## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a new model for predicting the probability that the Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index exceeds -100 nT with a lead time of 1 to 3 days. The model utilizes an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), specifically using data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT), and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). The study aims to enhance the forecasting capabilities for geomagnetic storms by leveraging solar image data, which has been less commonly used compared to solar wind data for such predictions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The MDI is used for observing the solar photosphere. It is one of the instruments whose data was utilized to train the CNN models for predicting the Dst index.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of the solar photosphere
- **Time Range**: May 1, 1996 – April 12, 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: 6768 Å (Ni I line)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar photosphere
- **Additional Comments**: The data from MDI was used in conjunction with other instruments to provide comprehensive solar imaging for the study.

### Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - EIT is used for imaging the solar atmosphere to the low corona. It captures images in various ultraviolet wavelengths, providing crucial data for solar studies.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of the solar atmosphere to low corona
- **Time Range**: January 1, 1996 – ongoing
- **Wavelength(s)**: 171 Å (Fe IX/X), 195 Å (Fe XII), 284 Å (Fe XV), 304 Å (He II)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar atmosphere to low corona
- **Additional Comments**: EIT data, especially at 195 Å, was specifically mentioned as being used in the CNN model training for this study.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SoHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used for observing the solar corona. It provides a larger field of view compared to other instruments, covering the corona from 1.5 to 30 solar radii.

#### Data Collection Period 1: General observation of the corona
- **Time Range**: December 8, 1995 – ongoing
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light
- **Physical Observable**: Solar corona from 1.5 to 30 solar radii
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO's data, particularly from the C2 and C3 cameras, was crucial for providing comprehensive coverage of the corona, which is essential for understanding solar phenomena related to geomagnetic storms.
