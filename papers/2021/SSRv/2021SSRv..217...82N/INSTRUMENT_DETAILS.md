1. Wind Spacecraft
   • Role: In situ observation of solar wind magnetic field and plasma conditions.
   • Measurement Capabilities: Monitors magnetic field strength, plasma speed, proton temperature, and geomagnetic indices (Dst, Kp).

2. STEREO Spacecraft (STEREO-A and STEREO-B)
   • Instruments: SECCHI suite including:
        - COR1 and COR2 Coronagraphs: Detect and track CMEs in white-light imagery.
        - EUVI (Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager): Provides EUV images of the solar disc and limb used to identify low coronal signatures such as dimmings and filament eruptions.
   • Role: Multi-point imaging of CMEs; confirmation of CME direction (e.g. Earth-directed or limb view); tracking propagation of faint or “stealth” CMEs.
   • Notable Usage: Establishing CME–ICME connections, particularly when LASCO imagery is ambiguous.

3. SOHO Spacecraft
   • Instrument: LASCO Coronagraph (specifically C2 and C3)
   • Role: White-light imaging of CMEs, including halo, partial halo, and streamer-blowout events.
   • Notable Details: LASCO observations contribute to identifying candidate CMEs (even those with weak signatures) and deriving CME kinematics via height–time profiles.

4. SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory)
   • Instruments:
        - AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly): Provides multi-wavelength EUV images used to detect low-coronal signatures (e.g., dimmings, post-eruption arcades, flare ribbons) associated with CME onsets.
        - HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager): Supplies high resolution photospheric magnetic field measurements; used for constructing synoptic magnetograms and for model boundary conditions.
   • Role: Enhanced sensitivity, high spatial and temporal resolution observations that enable the identification of subtle low-coronal changes during stealth CME events.

5. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)
   • Platform: Originally onboard SOHO.
   • Role: Provided synoptic maps for potential field extrapolations and for driving magnetic flux transport models used in simulating the coronal magnetic field evolution.
   
6. GOES Spacecraft
   • Role: Monitoring soft X-ray intensities to identify associated solar flares.
   • Notable Details: GOES observations were used to confirm flare associations with some CMEs, even when low-coronal signatures are elusive.

Additional Notes:
• Future Missions Mentioned: Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter are noted as providing complementary perspectives, though primarily in a scientific research context rather than routine space weather monitoring.
• Simulation Tools: While not observational instruments, magnetofrictional (MF) and full magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) codes (e.g., PLUTO) were used to model coronal magnetic field evolution and CME eruption dynamics. These simulation “instruments” assist in interpreting the observational data from the abovementioned spaceborne instruments.
