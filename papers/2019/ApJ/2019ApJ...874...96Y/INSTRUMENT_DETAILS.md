## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates a solar filament eruption and its subsequent reformation in NOAA AR 11791 on 2013 July 15. The paper emphasizes how newly emerging magnetic flux interacts with pre‐existing filament channels and overlying coronal loops. By tracking the timing of EUV brightenings, Hα signatures, and changes in magnetic connectivity, the authors detail two distinct reconnection stages. The work leverages high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments to pinpoint when reconnection occurred (e.g., during impulsive brightenings from about 00:50 UT to 02:30 UT and later during the filament eruption and post‐eruption reformation). In addition, soft X-ray (SXR) and hard X-ray (HXR) observations capture flare events (C1.0 and C3.0 classes) associated with these processes, while white-light coronagraph images document the associated CME. These coordinated, multiwavelength observations allow a comprehensive dissection of the interplay between emerging magnetic fields and filament channels.

## Instrumentation Details

- **General Comments**:
   - AIA records full-disk images of the Sun in multiple ultraviolet (UV) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. It is used here to capture fine details of the filament’s evolution, the development of EUV brightenings, the formation of an inverse S-shaped hot channel, and coronal dimming associated with the CME.

   - “The eruption and then reformation of the ﬁlament occurred in NOAA active region (AR) 11791 on 2013 July 15 and were well-observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012)... In this study, the 304 ˚A (He II, 0.05 MK), 94 ˚A (Fe XVIII, 7 MK), and 193 ˚A (Fe xii, 1.3 MK and Fe xxiv, 20 MK) images were used.”
