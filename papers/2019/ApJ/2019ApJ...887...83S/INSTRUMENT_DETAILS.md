## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper details the validation of the Alfvén Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) using an extensive suite of observations spanning from the low corona (close to the Sun) out to 1 AU in the heliosphere. The study compares synthetic observables generated by the AWSoM model with data from several instruments. Near the Sun (r < 1.25 R⊙), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from STEREO-A/EUVI and SDO/AIA are used, along with tomographic reconstructions of electron density and temperature based on AIA data. In the mid-corona (2.55 < r < 6 R⊙), white-light coronal density reconstructions from SOHO/LASCO-C2 are compared with model outputs. Further out, in the inner heliosphere, comparisons are made with solar wind velocity reconstructions from InterPlanetary Scintillation (IPS) observations at multiple radial distances (20 R⊙, 100 R⊙, and 1 AU). Finally, in-situ observations at 1 AU from the OMNI database (which aggregates data from ACE, WIND, Geotail, and others) are used for direct comparison with the modeled solar wind plasma parameters. The study focuses on two Carrington rotations, CR2208 (2018-09-02 to 2018-09-29) and CR2209 (2018-09-29 to 2018-10-26), representing solar minimum conditions.
