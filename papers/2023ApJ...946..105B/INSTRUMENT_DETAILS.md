## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the implications of different solar photospheric flux-transport (SFT) models for global coronal and heliospheric modeling. It compares predictions from two SFT models regarding solar wind properties, the location of open magnetic field footpoints, and the presence of coronal magnetic null points across various phases of a solar activity cycle. The study focuses on observations from April in even-numbered years between 2012 and 2020. The findings reveal significant solar cycle dependencies and transient differences between the models, particularly when new active regions enter the assimilation window. The differences in predictions are attributed more to the models' assumptions and implementations rather than the randomness in the evolution of surface flux.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board NASAâ€™s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The HMI instrument is crucial for providing magnetogram data used in the SFT models to evolve the global photospheric magnetic field forward in time. It plays a key role in the study by supplying the necessary data to compare the two different SFT models.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations for model comparison
- **Time Range**: April of even-numbered years from 2012 to 2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field
- **Additional Comments**: The data from HMI were crucial for generating global magnetic field maps and for initializing the SFT models used in the study.

### Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model
- **General Comments**:
   - ADAPT is one of the SFT models used in the study. It incorporates observational data and uses flux transport simulations to predict the magnetic field configurations at the Sun's surface.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Model simulation for comparison
- **Time Range**: April of even-numbered years from 2012 to 2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Simulated photospheric magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: ADAPT model outputs were used to assess the solar wind properties, open magnetic field footpoints, and coronal magnetic null points.

### SSW-PFSS model
- **General Comments**:
   - The SSW-PFSS model, another SFT model used in this study, integrates magnetogram data to simulate the photospheric magnetic fields and their evolution.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Model simulation for comparison
- **Time Range**: April of even-numbered years from 2012 to 2020
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable
- **Physical Observable**: Simulated photospheric magnetic fields
- **Additional Comments**: The model's outputs were critical for comparing with the ADAPT model to understand the differences in predictions related to the solar wind, magnetic field footpoints, and null points.
