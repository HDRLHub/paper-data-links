# This script was generated by an AI model and has not been reviewed by a human expert. Please use with caution.

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period as per the study context
start_date = '2010-01-01'
end_date = '2017-12-31'
time_range = a.Time(start_date, end_date)

# Frequency range for type II radio bursts with band splitting
frequency_range = a.Wavelength(20 * u.MHz, 200 * u.MHz)

# Note: Assuming CALLISTO data is accessible, if not, manual data retrieval might be necessary.
# This is a placeholder for the instrument and might need to be adjusted based on actual data availability.
# CALLISTO is not listed in the provided VSO interface, indicating a need for manual data access or use of another interface.
callisto_instrument = a.Instrument("CALLISTO")  # This is hypothetical and likely not valid in SunPy's Fido.

# Construct the query
# Since CALLISTO might not be available in Fido, this serves as a conceptual example.
radio_burst_query = Fido.search(time_range, callisto_instrument, frequency_range)

# Display the query results
print("Query for Type II radio bursts with band splitting (2010-2017):")
print(radio_burst_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data if CALLISTO is available through Fido or another method is established.
# radio_burst_files = Fido.fetch(radio_burst_query)
```

Note: The script assumes the availability of CALLISTO data through SunPy's Fido, which might not be the case. Researchers should verify the actual data access methods for CALLISTO and adjust the script accordingly. If CALLISTO data needs to be accessed manually or through specialized software or databases, this should be clearly stated and guided in the research methodology or data access section of the study.
