## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the evolution, propagation, and interaction of three closely spaced CMEs launched from active region 12673 between 09/09/2017 and 09/10/2017, together with their driven shock and subsequent SEP events observed at Earth, Mars, and STEREO-A. The paper combines remote-sensing observations with in‑situ data to constrain the CME—shock kinematics using multi‐spacecraft measurements from white‐light coronagraphs, EUV imagers, spectrometers, X‑ray instruments, radio monitors and surface detectors. Specific observation times such as the impulsive flare on 10 September 2017 (with notable signatures between ~15:50 and 16:10 UT), the CME launch times (with coronagraph images around 09/09 and 10/09) and the arrival of the shock and gradual SEP onset (e.g., ~02:50 UT on 13 September 2017 at Mars) are integrated into modeling efforts (DBM and ENLIL) to better predict space weather impacts.
