## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of an eruptive prominence observed on May 28, 2014. The study combines high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic data from multiple instruments to derive plasma velocities, density, temperature, hydrogen mass and ionization degree of the prominence. The observations span from early activation (around 11:00–11:25 UT) through the eruption phase (up to 22:50 UT with coronagraph data), leveraging instruments aboard IRIS, SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and a ground-based K-coronagraph at HAO. The multiwavelength and multi-viewpoint approach (from different heliographic angles) is crucial in diagnosing the physical properties and dynamics of the eruptive prominence.

### 1. IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph)
- **General Comments**:
  - IRIS provided both slit-jaw imaging (SJI) and spectroscopic observations that are used to study the prominence at high spatial and temporal resolutions.
  - It captured UV spectra in the Mg ii h & k lines, along with UV C ii and Si iv lines, permitting the derivation of both plane-of-sky velocities (through optical flow on SJI images) and Doppler velocities from spectral profiles.
  - The instrument’s observations allowed analysis of not only the dynamics (e.g., activation, downflows, and potential untwisting motions) but also plasma diagnostics (density, temperature, ionization degree, and integrated intensities).
