## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the occurrence rates and properties of halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs) during the rise phases of solar cycles 23, 24, and 25 to infer the relative strength of solar cycle 25. It utilizes data from various solar observation instruments and analyzes correlations between sunspot numbers (SSN) and HCME rates, as well as other solar wind parameters. The study finds that the properties of HCMEs and solar wind in cycle 25 are intermediate between those observed in cycles 23 and 24, suggesting that cycle 25 might be similar to or slightly stronger than cycle 24. The paper leverages data from instruments on board SOHO, SDO, and STEREO spacecraft, among others, to draw its conclusions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is used to observe and catalog HCMEs, providing crucial data on their occurrence rates and properties across different solar cycles.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of HCMEs during the rise phases of solar cycles 23, 24, and 25
- **Time Range**: 1996 – end of 2022
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We consider all HCMEs recorded by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO from 1996 until the end of 2022."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified in the provided context
- **Physical Observable**: HCME occurrence rates, properties such as heliographic coordinates, sky-plane and cone-model corrected speeds
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The catalog includes the heliographic coordinates of the associated eruptions along with the sky-plane and cone-model corrected speeds of the HCMEs."
- **Additional Comments**: Data from LASCO was crucial in establishing the correlation between HCME rates and SSN, as well as comparing the properties of HCMEs across different solar cycles.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides EUV images that help in identifying the solar sources of HCMEs, particularly useful for locating associated flares, filament eruptions, or coronal dimming.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Identification of solar sources for HCMEs in solar cycles 24 and 25
- **Time Range**: Specific dates not provided, but relevant to the rise phases of solar cycles 24 and 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The solar sources are identified using the locations of the associated flares (from NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center), filament eruptions or coronal dimming (identified in the EUV images obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO))."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
- **Physical Observable**: Locations of associated flares, filament eruptions, or coronal dimming
- **Additional Comments**: AIA's high-resolution EUV images are instrumental in accurately pinpointing the origins of HCMEs, which is critical for understanding their characteristics and impacts.

### Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) on board Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
- **General Comments**:
   - SECCHI is used to confirm the locations of backside halos, enhancing the understanding of HCMEs that originate from areas not visible from the Earth-Sun line.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Confirmation of backside halo locations in solar cycles 24 and 25
- **Time Range**: Specific dates not provided, relevant to the rise phases of solar cycles 24 and 25
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In SCs 24 and 25, the locations of backside halos are confirmed using EUV images obtained by STEREO’s Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
- **Physical Observable**: Locations of backside halos
- **Additional Comments**: SECCHI's observations are crucial for completing the mapping of HCME origins, especially for those CMEs that occur on the far side of the Sun relative to Earth.
