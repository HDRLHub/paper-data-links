# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the radiation belt response to a fast reverse shock (FRS) that impacted Earth’s magnetosphere on 06 December 2014. By using multi‐satellite observations and numerical simulations, the study assesses both magnetic field and energetic particle (electron and proton) responses at geosynchronous orbit and in the nightside magnetosphere. The work employs measurements from upstream solar wind monitors, geosynchronous satellites, and spacecraft located at different local times to capture temporal variations of the shock signature. Specific observation times – such as the shock onset at 21:09 UT on Wind and subsequent signatures at GOES, LANL-97A, and THEMIS-A – anchor the study’s timeline and enable the detailed analysis of physical observables (e.g., magnetic field strength, electron flux at various energies, and spectral indices) and detector response characteristics.

  - “The Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyser (SOPA) on the Los Alamos space environment monitor LANL-97A in geosynchronous orbit (∼6.6RE), is used to study electron and proton intensities in the nightside geosynchronous orbit. SOPA measures electrons in nine electron channels from ∼0.05–1.5 MeV and protons from ∼0.2–2.5 MeV.”

  - “The THEMIS Solid State Telescope (SST) records ions and electrons within the energy range from 25 keV to 6 MeV. The Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) on THEMIS measures the background magnetic ﬁeld in the near-Earth space environment (Angelopoulos 2009; Auster et al. 2008).”

### 6. Cluster Spacecraft Magnetometer – on board Cluster (validation purpose)
- **General Comments**:
  - Although not a primary data source in the particle intensity analysis, the magnetometer on Cluster spacecraft was used to validate the modeled magnetic field variations on the nightside, particularly as LANL-97A does not carry a magnetometer.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “There are no magnetic ﬁeld measurements available from LANL-97A… So this model predication can not be validated using LANL-97A. Thus to validate the nightside model ﬁelds, we have compared its predictions to the Cluster spacecraft observations (not shown here)...”

- **Time Range**: Specific time range not explicitly provided; measurements correspond to the nightside during the FRS event on 06 December 2014.

  - **Supporting Quote**: “…the decrease of ∆B ∼15 nT is observed by all four spacecraft.”
- **Additional Comments**: Used as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the BATS-R-US model predictions.
