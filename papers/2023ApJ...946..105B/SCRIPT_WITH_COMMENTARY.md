```

This script sets up a series of queries for the HMI instrument on the SDO spacecraft, specifically targeting the photospheric magnetic field data during April of each even-numbered year from 2012 to 2020. Each query is printed out, and the data download commands are commented out, adhering to the directive not to execute data retrieval within the script. This approach ensures clarity and specificity in data querying, directly reflecting the needs outlined in the context.
