## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper reviews the theoretical efforts to predict the amplitudes of solar gravity modes (g-modes) and discusses the challenges and prospects of detecting these modes. It highlights the importance of g-modes for probing the innermost layers of the Sun and understanding the physical processes in the solar core. The paper also compares the theoretical estimates of g-mode amplitudes with observational detection thresholds, particularly focusing on the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument. The review includes discussions on the driving and damping mechanisms of g-modes, the role of turbulent convection, and the potential of penetrative convection as an excitation mechanism. The paper concludes that low-frequency g-modes are more likely to be detected, while low-order g-modes remain challenging to observe with current instruments.

## Instrumentation Details

### GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOLF instrument is used to measure the oscillations of the Sun, particularly focusing on low-frequency modes. It provides crucial data for detecting solar gravity modes and understanding the dynamics of the solar core.
- **Supporting Quote**: "More precisely, around 60 µHz, the theoretical estimates are slightly lower than the observational detection threshold as provided by the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument by about a factor of two only."

   - **Supporting Quote**: "More precisely, around 60 µHz, the theoretical estimates are slightly lower than the observational detection threshold as provided by the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) instrument by about a factor of two only."
- **Additional Comments**: The GOLF instrument has been operational for over 22 years, providing continuous data that is crucial for the detection of low-frequency solar gravity modes.

### SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO is a spacecraft dedicated to studying the Sun, providing a comprehensive set of instruments to observe solar oscillations, solar wind, and the solar corona.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Unfortunately, none of them were conﬁrmed even after more than ten years of observations from SOHO (Appourchaux et al., 2000) and such a disappointing pattern repeated several times (a comprehensive review of the detection attempts can be found in Appourchaux et al., 2010)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of solar oscillations and attempts to detect g-modes
- **Time Range**: Over ten years of observations
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Unfortunately, none of them were conﬁrmed even after more than ten years of observations from SOHO (Appourchaux et al., 2000) and such a disappointing pattern repeated several times (a comprehensive review of the detection attempts can be found in Appourchaux et al., 2010)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the context
   - **Supporting Quote**: Not available
- **Physical Observable**: Solar oscillations, particularly gravity modes
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Unfortunately, none of them were conﬁrmed even after more than ten years of observations from SOHO (Appourchaux et al., 2000) and such a disappointing pattern repeated several times (a comprehensive review of the detection attempts can be found in Appourchaux et al., 2010)."
- **Additional Comments**: SOHO has been instrumental in the long-term observation of the Sun, providing valuable data for the study of solar oscillations and the search for g-modes.
