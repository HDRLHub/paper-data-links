produce the script. We need to construct queries for each of the instruments mentioned in the context, focusing on the specific dates and observables relevant to the study of the CME on March 13, 2012, and its subsequent detection and effects on March 15, 2012. We will use the SunPy library to access data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for the instruments specified in the context. The script will be structured to query each instrument separately, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. We will avoid nested calls and loops to keep the script straightforward and maintain readability. Each query will be specific to the instrument and the time range provided in the context, and we will ensure that the script reflects the data used in the context accurately.
