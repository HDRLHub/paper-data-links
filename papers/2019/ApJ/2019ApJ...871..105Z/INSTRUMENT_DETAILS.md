## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies the evolution of active region NOAA 12268 over a 36‐hour period—from 00:00 UT on January 29 to 12:00 UT on January 30, 2015—during which a magnetic flux rope was formed and a series of six flares (three M-class and three C-class) were triggered without accompanying CMEs. The study combines observations in multiple wavelengths (Hα, ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet, and soft X-rays) alongside nonlinear force‑free field modeling. These multiple observations help trace the formation, bifurcation, and evolution of the magnetic flux rope and its associated complex magnetic topology, especially as revealed by the flare ribbons’ evolution (transforming from circular to multiple and eventually three nearly parallel ribbons).

### 3. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on Board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides high-cadence (12 s) and high-spatial resolution (∼0.6″ per pixel) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and ultraviolet images of the Sun. It captures flare evolution at multiple wavelengths, revealing both the low‑temperature coronal structures and high‑temperature flaring plasma.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...the six ﬂares were also observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) with a high temporal cadence (12 s) and spatial resolution (∼0.6′′ per pixel).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Comprehensive EUV/UV Observations**
   - **Time Range**: 00:00 UT on January 29, 2015 – 12:00 UT on January 30, 2015
     - **Supporting Quote**: (Observations of all six flares in figures spanning this interval confirm the period.)
   - **Wavelength(s)**:
      - 1600 Å – Ultraviolet continuum targeting the lower solar atmosphere (~0.1 MK).
         - **Supporting Quote**: “...SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A images of the six ﬂares... The typical temperature for 1600 ˚A emission is ∼0.1 MK.”

   - **Physical Observable**: EUV/UV emissions revealing coronal loop structures, flare ribbons, and hot channels (magnetic flux ropes).
   - **Additional Comments**: AIA observations are central to identifying morphological transitions of flare ribbons from circular to multiple and finally to three parallel ribbons. They also help correlate these features with the underlying magnetic field structure.

### 4. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on Board SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides full-disk vector magnetograms by observing the four Stokes profiles (I, Q, U, and V) of the Fe I 6173 Å line. These magnetograms are crucial for reconstructing the coronal magnetic field using nonlinear force‑free extrapolation techniques.
