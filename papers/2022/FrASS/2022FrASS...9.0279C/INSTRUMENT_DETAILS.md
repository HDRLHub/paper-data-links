## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the effect of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) on Saturn's radio emissions, specifically the Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR). The study utilizes data from the Cassini spacecraft, which was in the solar wind during the ICME event in November 2014. The research aims to understand the correlation between solar wind disturbances and SKR emissions, using data from various instruments on Cassini, including the Radio and Plasma Waves Science (RPWS), Magnetometer (MAG), and Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument (MIMI). The study covers a 30-day interval from November 6 to December 6, 2014, and identifies significant increases in SKR emissions following the ICME shock and magnetic cloud passage.

## Instrumentation Details

### Cassini/RPWS (Radio and Plasma Waves Science) on board Cassini
- **General Comments**:
   - The RPWS instrument is used to observe radio emissions from Saturn, specifically the SKR, which is emitted by electrons traveling around auroral magnetic field lines. The instrument provides quasi-continuous observations of SKR from early 2004 to the end of the Cassini mission in October 2017.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Thanks to the Cassini RPWS (Radio and Plasma Waves Science) experiment (Gurnett et al., 2004) we have quasi-continuous observations of the SKR from early 2004 to the end of mission in October 2017."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations during the ICME event
- **Time Range**: 2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The data have been studied during a 30-day interval (2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00), that includes the predicted ICME arrival times at Saturn."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 3.5 kHz to 16 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The Cassini/RPWS/HFR instrument records radio electric signals from 3.5 kHz to 16 MHz, using three electric antennas."
- **Physical Observable**: SKR emissions, flux density, and polarization
   - **Supporting Quote**: "This instrument allows for reconstruction of the absolute flux density and polarization of the observed radio waves."
- **Additional Comments**: The study uses two datasets from the RPWS: the Level 3e (N3e) dataset and the SKR dataset.

### Cassini/MAG (Magnetometer) on board Cassini
- **General Comments**:
   - The MAG instrument provides magnetic field data, which is crucial for identifying the structure and timing of the ICME as it impacts Saturn.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Thus, it has been possible to use in situ data from the Cassini magnetometer (MAG) (Dougherty et al., 2004) to provide accurate timing for the ICME arrival."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Magnetic field observations during the ICME event
- **Time Range**: 2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The data have been studied during a 30-day interval (2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00), that includes the predicted ICME arrival times at Saturn."
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength and components
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The in-situ data (magnetic field and particle) displays several characteristic signatures which will be described in section 4."

### Cassini/MIMI (Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument) on board Cassini
- **General Comments**:
   - MIMI is used for energetic particle detection, providing data on charged particles that help identify the ICME's impact on Saturn's magnetosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Cassini/MIMI instrument is designed for energetic neutral and charged particle detection."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Particle observations during the ICME event
- **Time Range**: 2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The data have been studied during a 30-day interval (2014-11-06 00:00:00 to 2014-12-06 00:00:00), that includes the predicted ICME arrival times at Saturn."
- **Physical Observable**: Energetic particle flux
   - **Supporting Quote**: "In this study, we use data from the electron channels E4 with energy between 0.8 and 4.7 MeV, with a 1-hr average window and non-background subtracted."
