## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates solar radio type IV burst events that occurred on 23, 25, and 29 July 2004, all originating from the same active region. The study focuses on the apparent “cut‐off” features in the type IV burst emission when the source region moves from disk center toward the limb. It analyses both metric and interplanetary (IP) radio observations, comparing data from ground‐based instruments (sensitive to metric wavelengths) and space‐based instruments (observing decameter-hectometer wavelengths) to probe the emission mechanisms and propagation effects (e.g., absorption by shock-related regions). Temporal details—such as start and end times of metric and IP burst phases—are provided in Table 1 and in the discussion of each event, underscoring how the instruments’ observational time windows and frequency ranges contribute to estimating CME heights, shock locations, and magnetic field reconfiguration in the solar corona.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Wind/WAVES on board Wind Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - Wind/WAVES is a space-borne spectrograph that observes radio emission at decameter-hectometer wavelengths. It is used in this study to monitor the IP type IV bursts as these emissions drift from metric frequencies into the low-frequency domain (up to the upper limit near 14 MHz).
   - It also records associated type II bursts linked to CME-driven shocks.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Observations at DH wavelengths probe the plasma conditions and transients in the interplanetary (IP) space, and currently radio spectra are available from the spectrographs on board Wind (Bougeret et al., 1995).”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: 23 July 2004 Event (IP Type IV and Type II Observations)
- **Time Range**: 19:30–21:00 UT (IP Type IV burst); additionally, a type II burst was observed from 18:30–19:30 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In all three events both a metric type IV burst (ground-based observations at frequencies higher than 20 MHz) and an IP type IV burst (space observations at frequencies lower than 14 MHz) were observed…” (see Table 1 for 23 July timings).
- **Wavelength(s)**: Up to 14 MHz (upper frequency limit).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The metric type IV burst ... drifted to decameter waves where it was observed by Wind/WAVES.”

### 4. Nancay Decameter Array (NDA)
- **General Comments**:
