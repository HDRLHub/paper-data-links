## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reviews how interplanetary shocks propagating through the turbulent solar wind are modified by pre‐existing fluctuations. It discusses how shock surfaces become rippled over a range of scales and explains the consequences for the acceleration and transport of energetic particles (both ions and electrons). The review synthesizes data accumulated over many years from various spacecraft—including in situ shock lists and measurements—as well as results from hybrid and MHD simulations. While many instruments have provided the observational backdrop (with events recorded over decades), one detailed example is an interplanetary shock observed by ACE on day 118 of 2001 with measurements from ACE/EPAM and ACE/SWICS. The paper also refers to other missions (e.g., Wind, IMP, ISEE, STEREO, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Voyager, Cluster) that have contributed to the accumulated dataset and understanding of shock‐driven particle acceleration.
