1. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)
   - **General Comments**:
     - This instrument is used to obtain Doppler-velocity measurements of the solar surface. Its observations capture the line-of-sight projected velocity field, which is critical for studying the coupling of helioseismic normal modes and inferring solar interior properties.
     - The analysis in the paper utilizes wave‐field correlations measured with this instrument as a proxy for mode coupling in the Sun.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - “…the observed B-coefficients were computed for specific oscillation modes (described in the attendant captions) from 1 year of Michelson Doppler Imager observations (1996 -1997; Scherrer et al. 1995)” 
   - #### Data Collection Period 1: Helioseismic Oscillation Modes Measurement
     - **Time Range**: 1996 – 1997
       - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “…from 1 year of Michelson Doppler Imager observations (1996 -1997; Scherrer et al. 1995)”
     - **Wavelength(s)**: 
       - While specific wavelengths are not stated in the paper, the instrument is designed for Doppler-velocity measurements (i.e. observations of the solar photospheric spectral line used to determine the line-of-sight velocity). 
       - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “The present analysis relies on Doppler-velocity measurements of the surface – thus the observable is the line-of-sight projected velocity field.”
     - **Physical Observable**:
       - The instrument observes the Doppler shift in the solar photosphere, providing line-of-sight velocity data used to study solar oscillations and mode coupling.
       - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “…the measured signal at any given point in the frequency-wavenumber spectrum comprises contributions from modes at all temporal frequencies...”
     - **Additional Comments**:
       - The MDI is a space-based instrument; such instruments typically record data with virtually no temporal gaps, which is a stated advantage in isolating temporal frequencies close to mode resonances.
