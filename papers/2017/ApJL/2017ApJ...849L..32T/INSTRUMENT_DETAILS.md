## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the time-lag between solar activity indicators (sunspot number and heliospheric current sheet tilt angle) and the observed fluxes of galactic cosmic rays (CRs) near Earth. The study develops a predictive model of solar modulation using a comprehensive collection of time-resolved CR data from several space missions and balloon experiments. The analysis utilizes direct measurements of proton, antiproton, electron, and positron fluxes and their temporal profiles, primarily leveraging data from the PAMELA satellite, the EPHIN detector on SOHO, and the balloon-borne BESS Polar missions, spanning event dates from 2000 to 2016. The model and its parameters are constrained and validated through direct comparison to these data sets, forming the empirical basis for the presented results on the temporal evolution of CR fluxes and modulation effects.

### PAMELA (Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) on board Resurs-DK1 Satellite
- **General Comments**:
  - PAMELA's monthly-resolved proton data from July 2006 to January 2010 are a central dataset, directly used for constraining the model parameters and for time-profile analyses of cosmic ray fluxes near Earth during solar minimum and beyond.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We use monthly-resolved proton data from the PAMELA experiment (Adriani et al. 2013) collected in solar minimum conditions between July 2006 and January 2010..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Monthly-resolved proton flux during solar minimum

  - EPHIN/SOHO data cover both positive and negative polarity phases, providing crucial input for model validation.

### BESS (Balloon-borne Experiment with a Superconducting Spectrometer) Polar I/II Missions

- **Physical Observable**: Cosmic Ray flux, including antiproton/proton and positron/electron ratios, analyzed for time dependence and compared to model predictions.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Crucial tests can be performed by AMS measurements of the two ratios, or even better, by measurements of individual particle fluxes for p,  ¯p, e+, and e− under both polarity conditions and across the reversal."
- **Additional Comments**: 
  - BESS-Polar data provide high-statistics, time-specific validation points for model results, particularly for antimatter-to-matter ratios.
