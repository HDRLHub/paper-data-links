## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the evolution and properties of plasmoids in a current sheet formed in association with an X8.3 solar flare and a fast CME on September 10, 2017. The paper makes use of high-resolution multiwavelength observations ranging from the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) to white-light coronagraph images to track the formation, motion, size distribution, and acceleration of plasmoids along the current sheet. The observations span from the inner to the outer corona utilizing data with specific time ranges that are integral to understanding the dynamic evolution of plasma enhancements during magnetic reconnection.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA instrument provides high-resolution EUV images and is used in this study to capture the current sheet and the formation and motion of plasmoids in the lower (inner) corona at the 131 Å passband. It allows identification of both upward and downward moving plasmoids as discrete intensity enhancements along the current sheet.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We used Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) taken at 131 Å pass-band for high resolution observation near the solar limb starting from 15:30UT to 19:00UT.”

- **Wavelength(s)**: 131 Å (Extreme Ultraviolet)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...AIA 131 Å pass-band...”
- **Physical Observable**: Brightness enhancements due to increased plasma density indicating plasmoid formation and motion along the current sheet.
   - **Supporting Quote**:

- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The images have a pixel resolution of 0.6 arcsec, an exposure time of approximately 2.9 s, and a cadence of 24 s. The processing routine aia_prep.pro was used to adjust for rotation, alignment, and plate scale.

### 2. K-Cor Coronagraph on board Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The K-Cor instrument is a white-light coronagraph that observes the inner corona. In this study, it is employed to capture the current sheet and plasmoid evolution over a larger field-of-view compared to AIA. Only upward moving plasmoids are identified in this dataset.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The current sheet is also observed in white-light coronagraph images of the K-Cor telescope at Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) ... We used the available K-Cor level 1 images processed with a Normalised Radial Gradient Filter (NRGF) ... having ﬁeld of view (FOV) from 1.05 R⊙ to 3 R⊙ at a cadence of 2 minutes and resolution of 5.6 arcsec pixel−1 from 17:00UT to 19:00UT.”

   - The instrument provides a 5.6 arcsec pixel−1 resolution with a cadence of 2 minutes and a field-of-view covering from 1.05 R⊙ to 3 R⊙. Images are processed with the NRGF to enhance off-limb features.

### 3. LASCO/C2 Coronagraph on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 is a white-light coronagraph that observes the outer corona. It extends the observation of plasmoid evolution to larger heights up to approximately 6 R⊙. This instrument is used primarily to track the acceleration and propagation of upward moving plasmoids in the outer corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...LASCO/C2 images with cadence of 12 minutes and pixel resolution of 11.4 arcsec pixel−1 to track the outward moving plasmoids up to 6 R⊙. ... using LASCO/C2 images we found 17 plasmoids moving out in the outer corona for an extended period up to 20:00UT.”

   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “...the plasmoids moved upwards with speed ranging from 740 to 1800 km s−1 ... in the outer corona the plasmoids showed an average speed of ∼1080 km s−1.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The LASCO/C2 instrument has a cadence of 12 minutes and a spatial resolution of 11.4 arcsec pixel−1, enabling tracking of the plasmoids from the inner to the outer regions of the corona.

### 4. LASCO/C3 Coronagraph on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
