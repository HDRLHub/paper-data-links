## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the chain of effects from a solar eruptive event to its impact on Earth, focusing on the dynamic evolution of magnetic-field-related quantities in interplanetary space, particularly magnetic flux and helicity. The study examines a series of solar events originating from NOAA active region (AR) 12891 on November 1-2, 2021, including a C4.5 flare, a filament eruption, and a double-peak M-class flare. The magnetic structure of AR 12891 is deduced using stereoscopy and nonlinear force-free (NLFF) magnetic field modeling. The study also compares reconnection fluxes based on flare ribbon and coronal dimming signatures with in-situ measurements from Solar Orbiter and near-Earth spacecraft to understand the evolution of the associated interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME).
