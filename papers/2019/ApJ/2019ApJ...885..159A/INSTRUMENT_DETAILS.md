## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper explores the sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations to the solar corona’s electron density. The study compares a simple symmetric power-law model with modern three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models—specifically, the AWSoM model—to determine which better represents the spatial variability of the solar corona. The VLBI technique leverages dual-frequency observations (S band ≈2.3 GHz and X band ≈8.4 GHz) to measure differential group time delays as radio signals from distant extragalactic sources traverse the corona. Observations are derived from several VLBI sessions. A series of R&D sessions were held between November 2011 and December 2012 (with individual sessions such as RD1106 on 29 Nov 2011, RD1205 on 10 Jul 2012, etc.), and two additional sessions—AUA020 and AOV022—were conducted on May 1, 2017, and May 1, 2018, respectively. Additionally, the paper references other instruments (spacecraft and remote-sensing assets) that provide complementary solar corona observations. 

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) System
- **General Comments**:
   - VLBI is the central observational technique used in this study. It measures the group time delays between signals from extragalactic radio sources as they arrive at two Earth-based radio telescopes. The observations are performed at two radio frequency bands: S band (≈2.3 GHz) and X band (≈8.4 GHz). VLBI arrays from various networks—including stations from the Australian VLBI network, the Russian “QUASAR” network, HartRAO in South Africa, as well as stations from Japan, China, and South Korea—contribute data.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The quantity measured by VLBI is the difference in arrival times of a signal from an extragalactic radio source received at two radio telescopes (Schuh & Behrend 2012).”
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: R&D Sessions (Exploratory Observations)
- **Time Range**: November 2011 – December 2012  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The R&D sessions were scheduled by the IVS in 2011 and took place between November 2011 and December 2012.”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Radio wavelengths corresponding to S band (≈2.3 GHz) and X band (≈8.4 GHz).  
      - **Supporting Quote**: 
         - “VLBI measurements are performed at two frequencies: S band (≈2.3 GHz) and X band (≈8.4 GHz)” (sec. 5.1).
   - **Physical Observable**: Differential group time delays of radio signals, which are sensitive to the dispersive effects of the solar corona’s electron density.
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “The dispersive term of the time delay consists of delays in intergalactic and interplanetary media, the Earth’s ionosphere, the solar corona, and receiver hardware.” (sec. 5.1)
   - **Additional Comments**: Table 1 of the paper lists individual sessions (e.g., RD1106 on 29 Nov 2011, RD1205 on 10 Jul 2012, etc.) with varying numbers of observations and specific source elongations used to assess sensitivity to the coronal electron density.
   
#### Data Collection Period 2: AUSTRAL Program Sessions
- **Time Range**: May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2018  
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The AUA020 experiment was held on May 1, 2017 …” and “The AOV022 session (May 1, 2018) featured the same two radio sources…” (sec. 4)
   - **Wavelength(s)**: As above, observations are carried out at S band (≈2.3 GHz) and X band (≈8.4 GHz).
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “VLBI measurements are performed at two frequencies: S band (≈2.3 GHz) and X band (≈8.4 GHz)” (sec. 5.1).
   - **Physical Observable**: Enhanced sensitivity to the solar corona electron density via reduced elongation angles and a high number of observations, resulting in significantly lower parameter uncertainties.
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “A session that appears to be sensitive to the electron density models is AUA020. The reasons for that have to be (i) a fairly large number of observations close to the Sun and (ii) outstandingly small elongation angles.” (sec. 6)
   - **Additional Comments**: The AUA020 and AOV022 sessions helped to demonstrate the superiority of the AWSoM model over the symmetric power-law model.

### 2. LASCO C2 Coronagraph on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 coronagraph is used to acquire images of the solar corona, providing a visual context for the electron density models. In this paper, LASCO C2 images are shown alongside the AWSoM model outputs, serving as a comparison between remote-sensing imagery and numerical simulation.

   - **Supporting Quote**: The LASCO C2 images are used for comparative illustration with the AWSoM numerical electron density maps.

### 3. STEREO (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO is mentioned as an example of a spaceborne instrument that routinely takes observations of the solar corona. Its imagery, particularly in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) range, is used in other studies to compare with MHD models such as AWSoM.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “There are very useful and important observations of solar corona by spacecraft, like STEREO (Harrison et al. 2008);” (sec. 1)
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths are typically observed by STEREO.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - “…compared simulated multi-wavelength extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images with observations from Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)…” (sec. 2.2)
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emissions from the solar corona used to study its structure and electron density.
- **Additional Comments**: Although STEREO data is not directly analyzed in this paper, it is referenced to support validation of MHD model predictions.

### 4. Parker Solar Probe
- **General Comments**:
   - The Parker Solar Probe is cited as an upcoming source of in situ measurements of the solar corona. Its future observations are expected to provide detailed electron density measurements close to the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “…and in situ measurements of the solar corona by Parker Solar Probe (Bale et al. 2016) are expected soon.” (sec. 1)
- **Time Range**: Not specified; expected to operate in upcoming solar observations.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not directly applicable as it conducts in situ plasma measurements rather than remote-sensing observations.
- **Physical Observable**: Direct measurements of plasma properties, including electron density.
- **Additional Comments**: The probe’s measurements are anticipated to complement remote techniques such as VLBI for validating coronal models.

### 5. Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Global Ionosphere Maps (GIMs) are utilized in the data reduction process to correct for ionospheric delays in the VLBI measurements. They are generated from GPS satellite data and provide daily estimates of the total electron content (TEC) in the ionosphere.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Daily GIM ﬁles contain vertical total electron content (Ev) in TEC units (TECU); one TECU corresponds to 10^16 m−2 free electrons.” (sec. 5.2)
- **Time Range**: Daily updates are provided; however, the paper does not specify particular date ranges for these maps.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (the maps are derived from GPS observations, which are in the radio frequency range used by navigation satellites).
- **Physical Observable**: Vertical total electron content (TEC) used for the correction of ionospheric delay.
- **Additional Comments**: The GIMs are an important auxiliary tool that allows the isolation of the solar corona’s contribution to the VLBI group time delay by removing the ionospheric component.
