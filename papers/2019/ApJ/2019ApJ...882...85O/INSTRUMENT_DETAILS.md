## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a multi-spacecraft study of two stealth coronal mass ejection (CME) events – one on 27 October 2009 and the other on 3 March 2011 – using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, white‐light coronagraph observations, and photospheric magnetograms. The study employs advanced image processing techniques (including the Multi-scale Gaussian Normalization, or MGN) to reveal the faint low‐coronal signatures of these eruptions. The authors combine observations from several spacecraft (SOHO, STEREO, and SDO) to not only constrain CME kinematics via geometric models such as the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model, but also to examine associated plasma emission, magnetic field evolution, and radio signatures that provide indicators of flux rope formation and magnetic reconnection processes.
