## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a statistical analysis of 379 radio-loud (RL) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their associated solar flares during the period 1996-2019, covering solar cycles 23 and 24. The study classifies the events into two sets based on the observation period: 235 events belong to SC 23 (August 1996 - December 2008) and 144 events belong to SC 24 (January 2009 - December 2019). The research aims to compare the kinematic properties of RL CMEs, their associated solar flares, and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II radio bursts between the two solar cycles. The data sources include the SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs and the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES instruments. The findings indicate that RL CMEs in SC 24 decelerate faster and reach their peak speed at lower altitudes compared to those in SC 23, among other differences.

## Instrumentation Details

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO has been a crucial instrument for studying CMEs over the past two decades. It consists of three coronagraphs (C1, C2, and C3) that cover different observation ranges.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueckner et al., 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission (Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995) has been one of the most important instruments for studying CMEs for the past two decades."

### Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (WAVES) on board Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument records type II radio bursts in the decameter-hectometric (DH) domain, providing crucial data on CME-driven shocks.
- **Supporting Quote**: "They used type II radio bursts recorded in the decameter-hectometric (DH) domain as the primary data obtained by the Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (WAVES, Bougeret et al., 1995) on board the Wind spacecraft (hereinafter Wind/WAVES)..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Type II radio bursts
- **Time Range**: April 1997 – October 2006
   - **Supporting Quote**: "They used type II radio bursts recorded in the decameter-hectometric (DH) domain as the primary data obtained by the Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment (WAVES, Bougeret et al., 1995) on board the Wind spacecraft (hereinafter Wind/WAVES) only prior to October 2006..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Decameter-hectometric (DH) domain
   - **Supporting Quote**: "They used type II radio bursts recorded in the decameter-hectometric (DH) domain as the primary data..."
- **Physical Observable**: Type II radio bursts
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Another type of CMEs, referred to as radio-loud (RL) CMEs, is more fascinating to study and forecast space weather conditions (Gopalswamy et al., 2012b). These CMEs are associated to type II radio bursts and, as a result, to CME-driven shocks."

### STEREO/WAVES on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument also records type II radio bursts in the DH domain, complementing the data from Wind/WAVES.
- **Supporting Quote**: "...and thereafter by both Wind/WAVES and the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory (Kaiser et al., 2008) on board Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (Howard et al., 2008) or STEREO/WAVES."
