produce the script. We need to construct queries for the SWAN instrument on SOHO, as it is the only instrument from the context that is available in the VSO interface provided. The GLOWS instrument on the IMAP mission is not listed in the VSO interface, so we cannot construct a query for it. Instead, we will focus on querying historical data from SWAN that relates to the study of helioglow intensity variations due to solar Lyα emission and changes in the solar wind.

Given the context, we know that SWAN has been operational since 1995 and measures the Lyα backscatter from interstellar hydrogen. We will query for data across the full operational period of SWAN to cover various phases of solar activity, as mentioned in the context (solar maximum and minimum phases).

The script will be written in Python using the SunPy library, specifically utilizing the Fido interface for querying data. We will ensure the code is clear, well-commented, and avoids complex structures for ease of understanding and modification.
