1. STEREO/HI-1 on board STEREO-A  
   - General Comments:  
     - This instrument is a wide‐angle visible‐light imager that is used to detect and track plasma density structures (such as CMEs) in the heliosphere through Thomson-scattered photospheric light. It is one of two cameras in the HI instrument package on STEREO, and its images form the basis of the HICAT catalogue used in this study.  
     - The detector is a 2k × 2k CCD system, although for routine science operations images are binned to 1k × 1k before downlink.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “Version 5 of HICAT was derived from HI-1A images that were taken between 1 April 2007 (the start of the science phase of the STEREO mission) and 18 August 2014 (the last date for which nominal cadence imagery is available prior to the start of reduced operations); this version of the catalogue also includes CMEs identified in post-superior conjunction HI-1A imagery, taken after 17 November 2015 when full operations recommenced.”
   - Data Collection Periods:
     - Data Collection Period 1: Nominal Operations  
       - Time Range: 1 April 2007 – 18 August 2014  
       - Supporting Quote: “...derived from HI-1A images that were taken between 1 April 2007 (the start of the science phase of the STEREO mission) and 18 August 2014 (the last date for which nominal cadence imagery is available...)”  
       - Wavelength(s): Visible light (photospheric light scattered by free electrons via Thomson scattering)  
         - Supporting Quote: “The HI instruments allow the imaging of plasma density enhancements such as CMEs in the heliosphere through the detection of Thomson-scattered photospheric (visible) light.”
       - Physical Observable: Plasma density enhancements associated with CMEs.
     - Data Collection Period 2: Post-Superior Conjunction  
       - Time Range: From 17 November 2015 onward (exact end date not specified)  
       - Supporting Quote: “...this version of the catalogue also includes CMEs identified in post-superior conjunction HI-1A imagery, taken after 17 November 2015 when full operations recommenced.”
       - Wavelength(s): Visible light  
       - Physical Observable: Same as above – the evolving structure and propagation of CMEs via the scattered light signal.
       
2. STEREO/HI-1 on board STEREO-B  
   - General Comments:  
     - This instrument is the counterpart to the HI-1 camera on STEREO-A and provides wide-angle visible-light imaging of the heliosphere. It similarly employs a 2k × 2k CCD that is binned to 1k × 1k for routine usage. However, its effective detection threshold is slightly higher due to occasional instrumental jitter.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “For STEREO-B, this version of HICAT includes CMEs identified in HI-1B images taken between 1 April 2007 and 27 September 2014 (the latter corresponding to the last date for which images were available prior to loss of contact with the spacecraft).”
   - Data Collection Period:  
     - Time Range: 1 April 2007 – 27 September 2014  
     - Supporting Quote: As given above.
   - Wavelength(s): Visible light (observing Thomson-scattered photospheric light)  
     - Supporting Quote: “...imaging of plasma density enhancements... through the detection of Thomson-scattered photospheric (visible) light.”
   - Physical Observable: CMEs observed as density enhancements in the heliosphere.

3. STEREO/HI-2 on board STEREO (A & B)  
   - General Comments:  
     - HI-2 is the outer wide-angle camera in the HI instrument package. It has a much larger field of view (70° diameter) and is nominally aligned at 53.7° elongation in the ecliptic plane. Although not the primary focus of the current study, it is mentioned as part of the imaging suite that provides heliospheric imagery.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “The HI instrument on each STEREO spacecraft comprises two wide-angle, visible-light cameras: the 20° diameter field of view (inner) HI-1 camera ... and the 70° diameter field of view (outer) HI-2 camera – the bore-site of which is nominally aligned at 53.7° elongation in the ecliptic plane.”
   - Time Range:  
     - No explicit data collection time range is provided for HI-2 in the context of this paper.
   - Wavelength(s): Visible light  
     - Supporting Quote: As above.
   - Physical Observable: Plasma density enhancements (e.g., CMEs) via Thomson scattering.

4. STEREO/SECCHI Package (including EUVI, COR-1, and COR-2)  
   - General Comments:  
     - The SECCHI package provides multiple types of imagery. In particular, EUVI (the Extreme Ultra Violet Imager) provides disk imagery at four EUV wavelengths, while COR-1 and COR-2 are coronagraphs that image the solar corona in visible light. The SECCHI package is mentioned both in terms of its multi-wavelength capabilities and as a means of providing coronal context to the heliospheric CME observations.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “The imaging capabilities of the STEREO mission are provided by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al., 2008) package. SECCHI provides disk imagery at four EUV wavelengths (with EUVI, the Extreme Ultra Violet Imager), as well as visible-light imagery of both the corona and the heliosphere...”
   - Time Range:  
     - No explicit time ranges for the SECCHI components (EUVI, COR-1, COR-2) are provided in the text. The COR-2 CME catalogue is referenced (Vourlidas et al., 2017) but without detailed start/end dates in the provided context.
   - Wavelength(s):  
     - EUVI: Extreme ultraviolet at four wavelengths.  
     - COR-1 and COR-2: Visible light.
   - Physical Observable:  
     - EUVI: EUV emission lines from the solar disc.  
     - COR-1 and COR-2: White-light corona observations capturing Thomson scattering from coronal electrons (used for detecting CMEs).

5. SOHO/LASCO  
   - General Comments:  
     - LASCO is the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph on the SOHO spacecraft. It has been used extensively to generate long-term CME catalogues (such as the CDAW CME catalogue) and provides visible-light coronagraph images of CMEs.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “The most comprehensive, and hence arguably the most definitive, of these studies exploit the near-continuous 20-year set of visible-light coronal observations made by the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) on the joint ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)...”  
   - Time Range:  
     - The context does not provide explicit start and end dates for LASCO observations within this paper. It notes that LASCO CME rates (from the CDAW catalogue) are compared with those from STEREO but end dates are dictated by catalogue contents.
   - Wavelength(s): Visible light  
     - Supporting Quote: “...coronal observations made by the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995)...”
   - Physical Observable:  
     - White-light coronal brightness that results from Thomson scattering, used to detect and characterize CMEs.

6. Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) on board the Coriolis Mission  
   - General Comments:  
     - SMEI was a ground-breaking instrument flown on the low Earth-orbiting Coriolis mission that provided wide-field imaging of CMEs well beyond the typical field of view of earlier space-borne coronagraphs. Its observations are mentioned in the context of historical developments that led to heliospheric imaging.  
   - Supporting Quote:  
     - “...the advent of wide-angle, visible-light heliospheric imaging – by the ground-breaking Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI; Eyles et al., 2003) instrument flown on board the low Earth-orbiting Coriolis mission and, subsequently, by the flagship Heliospheric Imager (HI; Eyles et al., 2009) instruments on NASA’s STEREO mission...”
   - Time Range:  
     - The context does not specify the observation dates for SMEI.
   - Wavelength(s): Visible light  
   - Physical Observable:  
     - White-light imaging of CMEs via the detection of scattered photospheric light.
