# Example of a generic query setup for solar data analysis
# Note: Replace 'INSTRUMENT_NAME' and time range with specific details when available

# Define a hypothetical observation period

# Define a hypothetical wavelength range if applicable
# wavelength_start = XXXX * u.angstrom  # Replace XXXX with the actual wavelength start
# wavelength_end = YYYY * u.angstrom   # Replace YYYY with the actual wavelength end
# wavelength_range = a.Wavelength(wavelength_start, wavelength_end)

# Construct the query
# If wavelength is known, include it as: , wavelength_range

Explanation:
1. **Importing Libraries**: We start by importing necessary modules from `sunpy.net` and `astropy.units`. These libraries help in handling solar data and unit conversions respectively.
2. **Setting Up Hypothetical Parameters**: Since the context lacks specific details, we use placeholders like 'YYYY-MM-DD' for dates and 'INSTRUMENT_NAME' for the instrument. These should be replaced with actual data when available.
3. **Query Construction**: We construct a query using `Fido.search` which is a versatile function capable of handling various search attributes. The example includes a time range and an instrument, and it's structured to easily include a wavelength range if needed.
4. **Query Execution and Results**: The script prints out the query results. The actual data fetching line is commented out to prevent execution without specific details.

This script serves as a template and requires specific details to be fully functional. Once the actual data from the paper or additional sources is provided, the placeholders should be replaced accordingly to fetch and analyze the desired solar data.
