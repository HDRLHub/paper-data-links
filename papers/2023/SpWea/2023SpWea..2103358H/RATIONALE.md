produce the script. We need to construct queries for the LASCO instrument on SOHO and the SECCHI instruments (COR-2 and HI) on the STEREO spacecraft for the year 2011. Given the context, we will focus on the specific time range and instruments mentioned. We will use the `sunpy.net.Fido` interface to search for the data, specifying the instruments and the time range. The queries will be structured to fetch data from LASCO C2 and C3, as well as SECCHI COR-2 and HI from both STEREO A and B spacecraft. The data will be searched based on the available wavelength and physical observables as provided in the VSO interface.
