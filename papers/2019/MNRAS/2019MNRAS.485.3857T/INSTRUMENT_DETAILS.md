## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a new method to constrain the active latitude bands on solar-type stars by exploiting stellar-cycle‐induced frequency shifts in solar-like oscillations. The authors first validate their methodology using well‐characterized solar data and artificial datasets, then apply their approach to Kepler observations of the solar analogue HD 173701. Although the method uses p‑mode frequency shifts—which are affected by the spatial distribution of near-surface magnetic activity—it is robust against the absolute field strength because the relevant scaling factors cancel when taking frequency difference ratios. Observations spanning different epochs (covering portions of or complete activity cycles) are used to infer minimum and maximum latitudes, thereby revealing that the magnetic flux can extend over a wider latitudinal range than that indicated by sunspot distributions alone.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Kepler Space Telescope (for HD 173701)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Kepler mission provided high-quality, continuous photometric observations that allow the detection of solar-like oscillations in stars. In this study, Kepler data are used to obtain precise frequency shifts in the star HD 173701, thereby enabling the inference of the star’s active latitudinal bands.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "We used just over 3 years of short-cadence Kepler data on HD 173701, covering observing quarters Q5.1 through Q17.2 inclusive from the nominal mission."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of HD 173701’s Oscillations
- **Time Range**: Just over 3 years during the nominal Kepler Mission (quarters Q5.1 to Q17.2; specific calendar dates are not provided).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "covering observing quarters Q5.1 through Q17.2 inclusive from the nominal mission."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Photometric (intensity measurements over the broad visible band typical of Kepler observations).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Using intensity measurements from Kepler it is possible to detect only overtones of l = 0, 1 and 2..."
- **Physical Observable**: Frequency shifts of solar-like oscillations, reflecting changes induced by the near-surface magnetic field.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "we present a new method for determining the location of active bands of latitude on solar-type stars, which uses stellar-cycle-induced frequency shifts of detectable solar-like oscillations."
- **Additional Comments**: The full lightcurve is divided into 90-day segments (with 45-day overlaps) to track temporal variations corresponding to a significant fraction of HD 173701’s 7.4-year activity cycle.

### 2. BiSON (Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network)
- **General Comments**:
   - BiSON is a network of six ground-based telescopes that observe the Sun as a star via Doppler velocity measurements. It delivers long-duration, high-cadence data ideal for tracking p‑mode frequency shifts over solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Mode frequencies were extracted from 108-day timeseries covering solar cycle 23 using the peak-bagging approach outlined in Howe et al. (2015)."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Observing Solar Cycle 23
- **Time Range**: 108-day timeseries segments (with each dataset starting every 36 days) covering solar cycle 23.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "For BiSON’s 108-day data this equated to k = 17 epochs taken every 36 days."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Doppler velocity (sensitive to oscillatory motions on the Sun’s surface).
   - **Supporting Quote**: "BiSON is comprised of six ground based telescopes that observe the Sun as if it were a star in Doppler velocity."
- **Physical Observable**: p‑mode oscillation frequency shifts induced by magnetic activity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "frequencies of solar-like oscillations... that are entirely consistent with the non-spherically-symmetric distribution of near-surface activity on the Sun."
- **Additional Comments**: The long 108-day datasets provide the frequency resolution necessary to resolve the blended m components in unresolved Sun-as-a-star observations.

### 3. VIRGO SPM (on board SoHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The VIRGO SPM instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) utilizes sun photometers to record intensity variations on the Sun. These data are used to extract low-degree p‑mode frequencies across extended periods.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "low-l solar data from the VIRGO (Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations) SPM (sun photometers) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)..."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Oscillation Observations over an 11-Year Cycle
- **Time Range**: 180-day lightcurves (with 90-day overlaps) covering approximately 12 years, which allows analysis of one complete 11-year solar cycle.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The VIRGO data cover approximately 12 years, and hence we were able to analyse one entire 11-year cycle in addition to the constituent rising and falling phases."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Photometric (intensity measurements, typical of visible light observations).
- **Physical Observable**: Temperature/integrated light variations associated with p‑mode oscillations and their frequency shifts.
   - **Supporting Quote**: "frequencies were estimated from peak-bagging applied to the power spectra of 180-day lightcurves..."
- **Additional Comments**: The longer 180-day datasets were chosen to reduce the noise levels evident in shorter observational segments.

### 4. GONG (Global Oscillations Network Group)
- **General Comments**:
   - The GONG network provides highly spatially resolved observations of the Sun, covering a broad range of angular degrees (l = 0 to 150). This capability allows for detailed mapping of latitude-dependent frequency shifts.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "For example, Howe et al. (2002) used frequency shifts of modes covering the range l = 0 to 150 observed by the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) – with effectively a separate frequency available for each azimuthal order m – to produce a map of levels of shift distributed over latitude and time."
- **Time Range**: The paper does not provide explicit time ranges for the GONG data; it is mentioned as an example of high spatial resolution observations of the Sun.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Doppler velocity (as typical for solar oscillation measurements).
- **Physical Observable**: Detailed frequency shifts across a wide gamut of p‑modes, facilitating mapping of the spatial distribution of surface magnetic activity.
- **Additional Comments**: While GONG is not the primary dataset used in the analysis presented in this paper, it is cited to highlight the contrast with the lower-degree, unresolved data from which the new method extracts latitudinal information.

### 5. NSO (National Solar Observatory) Synoptic Charts
- **General Comments**:
   - Synoptic charts from the NSO provide longitudinal maps of the Sun’s unsigned magnetic field strength, thereby offering an independent measure of magnetic flux distribution over the solar surface.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Figure 6 shows unsigned solar magnetic field strength data from synoptic charts generated by the National Solar Observatory (Howe et al. 2017)."
- **Time Range**: The synoptic charts correspond to the same observational epochs used for the frequency shift analyses (covering the rising and falling phases of solar cycle 23); specific calendar dates are not provided.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field measurements, not based on optical wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Spatial distribution of solar magnetic flux.
- **Additional Comments**: The NSO data support the interpretation that the inferred latitudinal extent of the active bands (from frequency shift analyses) encompasses regions of both strong and weaker magnetic flux.

### 6. CoRoT Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - The French-led CoRoT satellite is noted for having provided long, high-cadence, high-quality lightcurves suitable for asteroseismic studies. Although CoRoT data are mentioned as part of the observational landscape that has advanced the field, the primary asteroseismic analysis in this study relies on Kepler data.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "thanks to the availability of long, high-cadence, high-quality lightcurves from the French-led CoRoT satellite..."
- **Time Range**: The paper does not specify a time range for CoRoT observations; its mention serves to acknowledge the contributions of multiple space-based telescopes to the field.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Photometric (intensity measurements in visible light).
- **Physical Observable**: Solar-like oscillations and their frequency shifts.
- **Additional Comments**: CoRoT is cited to emphasize the importance of long-duration, high-cadence data for enabling precise asteroseismic analysis, even though the Kepler dataset is the one primarily used for inferring active latitudes in this study.
