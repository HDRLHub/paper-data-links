## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the mass loss from the Sun via the quasi‐steady solar wind and episodic coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles 23 and 24. It quantifies the CME mass loss rate and examines its relationship with proxies of solar magnetic activity (sunspot numbers and solar X-ray background luminosity). The analysis relies on white‐light coronagraph observations to identify and measure CME properties, in situ measurements of the solar wind at 1 AU to determine mass flux, and soft X-ray flux measurements from GOES to determine the background X-ray luminosity. Solar cycle 23 is defined as spanning from August 1996 to December 2008, while analysis for cycle 24 is restricted to 2009–2016. These observational data sets and corresponding proxies are essential to understand the variation and relative contribution of CMEs compared to the solar wind over the solar cycle.

### 1. SOHO/LASCO on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) is used to observe CMEs in white-light by imaging the solar corona. Originally equipped with three coronagraphs (C1, C2, and C3), after the loss of C1 in 1998, the analysis primarily uses images from LASCO C2 and C3.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The catalog lists the CMEs observed by Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. The LASCO initially carried three coronagraphs with overlapping ﬁelds of view (C1: 1.1–3 R⊙, C2: 2–6 R⊙, and C3: 3.7–32 R⊙), among which the C1 could not survive after the temporary loss of the SOHO spacecraft in 1998 and therefore CMEs are identiﬁed using images from the C2 and/or C3 coronagraphs.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Cycle 23
- **Time Range**: August 1996 – December 2008
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Solar cycle 23 is considered to span from August 1996 to December 2008 with its maximum around 2002…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (visible continuum via Thomson scattering)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…CMEs are identified from the white-light coronagraphic images…”
- **Physical Observable**: Occurrence, kinematics, and mass of CMEs
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The mass is determined by subtracting a pre-event background image from the image containing a CME, and the mass associated with each pixel is derived from the excess brightness using the theory of Thomson scattering.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: January 2009 – December 2016 (analysis period)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In the catalog, the CME observations… therefore we limit our analysis for solar cycle 24 only for the period of the year 2009 to the year 2016.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light coronagraphic images same as above.
- **Physical Observable**: CME occurrence rate and mass loss rate from different latitudinal bins
   - **Additional Comments**: The study further groups CMEs by their projected source latitudes (e.g., within –30° to 30°, –60° to 60°, and –90° to 90°) to understand latitudinal dependence of mass loss.

### 2. WIND Spacecraft In Situ Detectors
- **General Comments**:
   - The WIND spacecraft provides in situ measurements of the solar wind near 1 AU. These measurements include the hourly averaged proton density and speed that allow estimation of the proton mass flux and hence the global solar wind mass loss rate.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We used solar wind measurements from in situ instruments on board WIND spacecraft located in the ecliptic at around 1 AU distance from the Sun.”
  
#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Data spanning solar cycles 23 and 24 (approximately 1996 to 2016)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Using the hourly averaged in situ observations of solar wind near 1 AU, we estimated the monthly averaged proton density (np), speed (vp) and resulting proton mass ﬂux (np × vp) at 1 AU.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ particle measurements; plasma observables rather than electromagnetic wavelengths)
- **Physical Observable**: Solar wind proton density, speed, and resulting mass flux
   - **Additional Comments**: These parameters are used to calculate the total solar wind mass loss rate and to subsequently determine the contribution of CME mass flux relative to the ambient solar wind.

### 3. GOES X-ray Sensors
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES X-ray sensors are utilized to measure the soft X-ray background flux from the Sun. By subtracting the contribution of flares, the study converts the measured non-flaring X-ray flux into the solar X-ray background luminosity, which serves as an important proxy for the state of the solar corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “After excluding the luminosity contributed by ﬂare data points, we calculated the monthly average of the non-ﬂare GOES X-ray ﬂux. We then converted the measured X-ray background ﬂux into the X-ray luminosity from the Sun.”
  
#### Data Collection Period
- **Time Range**: Observations covering the period of solar cycles 23 and 24 (roughly 1996 to 2016)
   - **Supporting Quote**: While an explicit starting and ending date is not provided in the GOES section, the overall study analyzes proxies over “1996 to 2016.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray wavelengths (typical GOES bandpass, e.g., 1–8 Å)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…the typical measured GOES ﬂux associated with a solar ﬂare… comes from the soft X-ray band…” (inferred from discussion on soft X-ray background).
- **Physical Observable**: Soft X-ray background luminosity from the corona
   - **Additional Comments**: This observable is used to determine a better proxy for CME mass loss rate compared to sunspot number, given its high dynamic range.
