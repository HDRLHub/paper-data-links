## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the early 3D evolution and asymmetric expansion of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using multi-viewpoint observations. The study focuses on events tracked from their low-corona inception (using extreme-ultraviolet imagery) out through the outer corona (using white‐light coronagraphs). The analysis relies on simultaneous imaging from several spacecraft – using STEREO’s EUV and coronagraph instruments (EUVI, COR1, and COR2), SOHO’s LASCO C2, and SDO’s AIA – to constrain the CME morphology via forward modeling. The events, observed during two quadrature intervals (November 2010–July 2011 and December 2012–June 2013), provided a range of observational time stamps that allowed the researchers to quantify parameters such as angular widths and expansion speeds in both axial (edge‐on) and lateral (face‐on) directions.

### 3. STEREO/SECCHI COR1 on board the STEREO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The COR1 coronagraph is part of the SECCHI suite and is used to track the CME’s propagation through the inner corona via white-light imaging. It captures Thomson-scattered light, which reveals the density structure of the ejected material.

   - "white-light coronal images captured from multiple vantage points constitute the main data set... during its propagation through the FOV of the coronagraphs STEREO COR1 and COR2" (Section 2.1)

### 4. STEREO/SECCHI COR2 on board the STEREO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - The COR2 coronagraphs (on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B) extend the field of view to track the CME into the outer corona. They capture white-light images enabling the determination of the CME’s expansion and propagation characteristics.
