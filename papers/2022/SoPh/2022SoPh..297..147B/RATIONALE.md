```python
# Context: Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form
# Instruments: GOLF on board SOHO

# Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to query the VSO for data from the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft. The context specifies that the GOLF instrument is used to measure solar oscillations, particularly focusing on low-frequency gravity modes. The data collection period spans over ten years of observations. We will use the time range from the VSO interface for GOLF, which is from 1996/01/01 to present.

from sunpy.net import Fido
from sunpy.net import attrs as a

# Define the time range for the query
time_range = a.Time('1996-01-01', '2023-10-01')  # Adjust the end date as needed

# Define the instrument and source
instrument = a.Instrument('GOLF')
source = a.Source('SOHO')

# Construct the query
query = Fido.search(time_range, instrument, source)

# Print out the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script constructs a query to the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for data from the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft, focusing on the time range from 1996-01-01 to the present. The query results are printed out, and the data fetching command is commented out.
