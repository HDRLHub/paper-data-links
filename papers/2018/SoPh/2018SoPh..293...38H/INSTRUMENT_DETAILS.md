## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a statistical study of ribbon evolution and the reconnection electric fields in solar flares—both eruptive and confined—by analyzing chromospheric Hα flare observations combined with photospheric magnetograms and GOES soft X-ray (SXR) light curves. The study covers flares observed from June 2000 to June 2015 and examines key parameters such as flare‐ribbon separation, separation velocity, magnetic‐field strength, and the derived reconnection electric field. A variety of instruments, from ground‐based Hα telescopes to space‐borne magnetographs and X-ray monitoring satellites, are used to provide a comprehensive dataset for correlating flare energetics with magnetic reconnection processes.

  - MDI provides full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms essential for deriving the photospheric magnetic field strengths associated with flare ribbons.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “To calculate the coronal electric field, measurements of the photospheric magnetic field are required. Therefore, we used 96m full-disk magnetograms from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI; Scherrer et al., 1995) onboard SOHO for flares before 2011.”
