## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents the Probabilistic Solar Particle Event foRecasting (PROSPER) model, which predicts the probability of occurrence and the expected peak flux of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. The model uses characteristics of solar flares (longitude, magnitude), coronal mass ejections (width, speed), and combinations of both to make predictions for integral proton energies (E>10, >30, and >100 MeV). The methodology and validation of the model are described, with data from various instruments being used to develop and validate the model. The PROSPER model is integrated into the Advanced Solar Particle Event Casting System (ASPECS) for operational nowcasting of SEP events.
