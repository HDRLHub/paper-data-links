## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports the detection of an X‐ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 coincident with an intense, FRB‐like radio burst. The study uses data from several high‐energy space instruments and radio telescopes to investigate the connection between magnetar activity and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Key observations were made in April 2020 by the AGILE satellite, which recorded a “burst forest” of hard X‐ray events and one particularly notable burst that lasted approximately 0.5 s. Simultaneous radio detections in different bands were achieved using CHIME/FRB and STARE2, while additional radio monitoring was performed by the Northern Cross Telescope. The paper also refers to corroborating detections by Integral, Konus‐Wind, and Insight‐HXMT, as well as X‐ray monitoring of a repeating FRB (FRB 180916) with Swift-XRT and Chandra. Each instrument’s operating energy (or frequency) band, time coverage, and physical observables (e.g., X‐ray fluence, radio burst fluence) play a critical role in constraining the energetics and emission mechanisms of magnetar bursts and their possible relation to FRBs.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. AGILE Satellite – Multiple Detectors on board AGILE
- **General Comments**:
   - AGILE is a space mission of the Italian Space Agency designed for high-energy astrophysics. It hosts several detectors that continuously record hard X-rays and gamma-rays. In this study, AGILE detected a “burst forest” of X‐ray events from SGR 1935+2154 and a single hard X-ray burst in temporal coincidence with an FRB-like radio burst.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "During routine operations in April 2020, the AGILE satellite [11] detected many tens of hard X-ray bursts originating from SGR 1935+2154. The satellite instrument is currently operating with the fully operational MCAL detector sensitive in the 400 keV – 100 MeV, and with Super-AGILE (SA), Anti-coincidence (AC) and gamma-ray imager (GRID) ratemeters (RMs) being sensitive in the energy bands 18-60 keV, 80-200 keV, and 20 keV – 1 MeV, respectively."
