## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a new approach to estimating the arrival time (transit time, TT) of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at Earth. The authors introduce a new definition of the CME “initial speed” defined as the maximum instantaneous speed achieved during the CME’s early expansion. They utilize data from two major space‐observing facilities – SOHO and STEREO – to obtain independent measurements of CME velocities, overcome projection effects, and build empirical as well as kinematic models to predict TT with reduced errors. The study focuses on halo and partial–halo CMEs observed during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 24 (primarily between 2009 and 2013). In addition, in-situ data from ACE are employed to record final ICME speeds at Earth, providing a link between near-Sun observations and Earth-impact parameters.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. SOHO/LASCO on board the SOHO Spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) records white–light images of the solar corona. It has been used to obtain height–time measurements through running–difference images and is a key component of the SOHO/LASCO catalog.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Since 1995, CMEs have been routinely recorded by the sensitive LASCO (Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard the SOHO mission.” 
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Overall Operational Period
- **Time Range**: Since 1995 – December 2016
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The SOHO/LASCO instruments had already recorded about 30,000 CMEs by December 2016.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White–light (coronagraphic imaging)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…determined manually from running‐difference images…” 
- **Physical Observable**: Height–time measurements of CME fronts, used to derive average speeds as well as the maximum instantaneous speed (V₅) by performing linear fits.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The initial velocity of CMEs obtained by ﬁtting a straight line to the height–time measurements has been the basic parameter used in prediction of the TT.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Study-Specific Epoch
- **Time Range**: 2009 – 2013
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Syed Ibrahim, Manoharan, and Shanmugaraju (2017) compiled a list of halo and partial–halo CMEs during 2009–2013…”
- **Additional Comments**: This period corresponds to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 24 when SOHO/LASCO observations were used to measure CME onset times and speeds that are later compared with in-situ arrival times at Earth.

### 2. STEREO/SECCHI on board the STEREO Spacecraft (Including COR2 and HI1 Detectors)
- **General Comments**:
   - The STEREO spacecraft carry the SECCHI suite of instruments, which includes the COR2 coronagraphs and the HI1 optical telescopes. These instruments provide white–light images of the corona from a side–view (quadrature) relative to the Earth, reducing projection effects and allowing for more accurate measurements of the plane–of–sky speeds and instantaneous (V₅) speed profiles.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Since the launch of STEREO (Kaiser et al. 2008) in 2006… for these measurements we used COR2 coronagraphs and the optical telescopes: HI1.”
   
#### Data Collection Period: Study-Specific Epoch
- **Time Range**: 2009 – 2013
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “…we focus on halo and partial–halo CMEs during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 24…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White–light / Optical wavelengths (typical for coronagraph and heliospheric imager observations)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...observations from STEREO/SECCHI” (implying standard white–light imaging in the corona and heliosphere)
- **Physical Observable**: Height–time data points used to calculate both average speeds and the maximal instantaneous speed (V₅) via linear fits over five consecutive height–time points.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Having the STEREO height–time measurements, we could obtain initial speeds of CMEs… These profiles of instantaneous velocities can be easily used to determine the maximal/V₅ velocity in … STEREO.”

### 3. Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - ACE provides in-situ measurements of the solar wind near the Earth. In this study, ACE instruments are used to record the final velocity of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) and the arrival times of both ICMEs and associated shocks.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...the TTs of ICMEs and shocks and ﬁnal velocity of ICME in the vicinity of Earth received by the in−situ observations made by AdvancedCompositionExplorer (ACE) instruments…”
- **Data Collection Period**: 
   - Implicitly during the same interval as the CME events used in the study (2009 – 2013), as indicated by the arrival times listed in Table 1.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in-situ particle and field measurements, not optical)
- **Physical Observable**: Final speed of the ICMEs and shock arrival times at Earth.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “...final velocity of ICME …”

### 4. Helios 1 Spacecraft (Archival Data)
- **General Comments**:
   - Helios 1 is referenced as one of the spacecraft that provided archival data used by previous studies to help correct for projection effects in coronagraphic observations.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Gopalswamy et al. (2001b) used archival data from spacecraft in quadrature (Helios 1 and P78-1).”
- **Data Collection Period**: Not explicitly specified in the current paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
- **Physical Observable**: White–light or coronagraph measurements used in earlier derivations of the relation between effective acceleration and initial CME speeds.
- **Additional Comments**: Although Helios 1 is not directly used in the present study, it is mentioned as part of the historical context for overcoming projection effects.

### 5. P78-1 Spacecraft (Archival Data)
- **General Comments**:
   - P78-1 is mentioned alongside Helios 1 as a source of archival data for quadrature observations, which were used by previous researchers to refine empirical relationships in CME studies.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Gopalswamy et al. (2001b) used archival data from spacecraft in quadrature (Helios 1 and P78-1).”
- **Data Collection Period**: Not provided within the paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
- **Physical Observable**: Coronagraphic observations pertinent to estimating true CME speeds by reducing projection effects.
- **Additional Comments**: P78-1’s inclusion helps establish the foundation on which the current study improves CME transit time predictions by using more modern instruments.
