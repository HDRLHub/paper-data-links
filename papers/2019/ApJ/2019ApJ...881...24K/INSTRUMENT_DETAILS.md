## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports the direct estimation of the solar coronal magnetic field by combining contemporaneous observations in the radio, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and white-light regimes. The authors use a split-band type II radio burst observed on 2016 March 16 along with EUV images of a flux rope structure (signature of a coronal mass ejection, CME) and white-light coronagraph data. Each data set provides different observables—radio dynamic spectra and imaging (e.g., Stokes I and V, brightness temperature and source location), EUV flux rope morphology at 211 Å, and white-light polarized brightness measurements used to derive local electron densities. The combined height–time plots and estimated physical parameters (e.g., Alfvén speed, Mach number) allow the authors to derive an empirical radial variation for the magnetic field B(r) in the corona over r ≈1.1–2.2 R⊙.
