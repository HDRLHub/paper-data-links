## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines how well various models forecast the arrival times of coronal mass ejection (CME)–driven shocks at Earth. The study uses forecasts submitted to NASA’s Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) over a six‐year period (from 2013 through mid‑2018), comparing predicted arrival times to in‑situ “hits” at 1 AU. Although the focus is on model performance, several observational instruments and data types are mentioned as sources for the initial CME characteristics. These include white‑light coronagraph images, GOES X‑ray traces, metric radio observations of type II bursts, heliospheric imager data (e.g., from STEREO A), magnetograms used to drive ambient solar wind models, and interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations from facilities such as Ooty. In some cases, in‑situ measurements (e.g., Wind spacecraft data) are used as ground‐truth for identifying shock arrivals.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. White‑Light Coronagraph Observations
- **General Comments**:
   - These observations provide the primary images of CMEs as they erupt and propagate through the solar corona. The resulting white‑light images are used to perform “cone model” fits from which the initial CME speed, density, direction, and location are derived.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...the model is initialized by parameters derived from a ‘cone model’ fit to white‑light images as the CME is observed to pass through the solar corona.”
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME Initialization**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly given in UT or date range; observations are taken at the time of the CME eruption (typically soon after the flare onset).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...once a new CME had been identified at the Sun, the users would submit their forecast in real‑time...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Broadband visible wavelengths (white‑light), though no specific wavelength interval is provided.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...observed in white‑light images...”
   - **Physical Observable**: CME morphology, projected speed, and expansion — used to determine the initial conditions for forecasting.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the initial speed, density, location, and propagation direction of the plasma ejecta are all derived from these observations...”
   - **Additional Comments**: These images serve as the starting point for several CME models by providing a proxy for the CME’s piston‐driver phase.

### 2. GOES X‑Ray Sensor
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES X‑ray sensor provides measurements of the solar X‑ray flux during a flare. Its trace is used as a proxy for the duration of the piston‐driving phase of the eruption that launches the CME.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the duration of the GOES X‑ray trace (which acts as a proxy for the duration of the piston‑driving portion of the velocity profile)...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Flare Onset and Duration**
   - **Time Range**: While no explicit UT time range is stated, the sensor records from the instant a flare begins until its decline, capturing the full evolution of the flare’s X‑ray emission.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...the start time of the metric radio type II radio drift, the duration of the GOES X‑ray trace...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: X‑rays (exact energy bands are not specified).
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...GOES X‑ray trace...”
   - **Physical Observable**: X‑ray flux (used to gauge the energy release and duration of the flare’s active phase).
      - **Supporting Quote**: as above.
   - **Additional Comments**: The GOES X‑ray record is vital for constraining the timing used as input to both empirical and physics‑based CME arrival models.

### 3. Metric Radio Instruments (Type II Radio Burst Observations)
- **General Comments**:
   - Radio instruments that detect metric type II radio bursts are used to establish the onset time for the CME‑related shock. The drift in frequency provides insight into the shock’s initial dynamics.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the start time of the metric radio type II radio drift...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Shock Initiation**
   - **Time Range**: There is no specific UT or date range provided; the measurements are recorded at the onset of the radio burst associated with the CME.
      - **Supporting Quote**: as above.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Metric wavelengths (typically in the tens to a few hundred MHz range), although the precise wavelength band is not detailed.
   - **Physical Observable**: The start and drift rate of the type II radio burst, which indicate the formation and initial propagation of the CME‑driven shock.
   - **Additional Comments**: These observations complement white‑light images by providing a temporal marker for when the shock is initiated.

### 4. Heliospheric Imagers (HI) on STEREO A
- **General Comments**:
   - Heliospheric Imagers onboard spacecraft such as STEREO A are employed to track CMEs as they propagate along the Sun‑Earth line. Their imaging, based on visible light scattering, allows the CME’s trajectory and evolution to be followed over extended distances.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...Heliospheric Imagers (HI), which allow the tracking of CMEs along the entire Sun‑Earth line [e.g. Davis et al., 2009]. Möstl et al. [2017], using HI images from STEREO A...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: CME Propagation Tracking**
   - **Time Range**: HI observations cover the period from near the Sun (e.g. around 0.3 AU) through to 1 AU where the CME (or its shock) is detected, though explicit start and end times in UT or dates are not provided.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...for a set of 76 Earth impacting CMEs, the mean error in accuracy was 3±16 hr...” (context implying continuous tracking during propagation).
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light (white‑light imaging via Thomson scattering), though specific bands are not itemized.
   - **Physical Observable**: The position and expanding front of the CME, which are used to constrain the kinematics of the ejection.
   - **Additional Comments**: HI data can improve arrival time predictions but generally yield a shorter lead time compared to coronagraph‑only methods.

### 5. Magnetograms
- **General Comments**:
   - Magnetograms provide maps of the solar surface magnetic field that are essential for constructing synoptic charts used to drive ambient solar wind models such as WSA.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...the magnetograms used to drive the background solar wind flow are plagued with uncertainty. Synoptic maps, that is, maps built up from 27‑day observations from Earth, or near‑Earth space...”
- **Data Collection Period 1: Synoptic Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Typically obtained over a full solar rotation (approximately 27 days), though the paper does not provide a specific start–end date.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “...maps built up from 27‑day observations...”
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified; magnetograms generally use visible or near‑infrared spectral lines (e.g., the Fe I line) but the paper does not detail this.
   - **Physical Observable**: The line‑of‑sight photospheric magnetic field, which is critical for modeling the coronal magnetic topology and the ensuing solar wind.
   - **Additional Comments**: The quality and source variations of these magnetograms can affect the accuracy of the modeled ambient solar wind conditions.

### 6. Ooty Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) Instrument
- **General Comments**:
   - The Ooty IPS instrument (associated with the Ooty Radio Telescope) measures interplanetary scintillation, which can be used to infer the propagation of disturbances such as CMEs in the solar wind.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - In Table 1, “Ooty IPS” is listed among the models, indicating the use of IPS observations in forecasting CME arrival times.
- **Data Collection Period 1: IPS Observations**
   - **Time Range**: The paper does not specify exact observation windows; IPS measurements are made as CMEs traverse interplanetary space.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Although not detailed in the text, typical IPS measurements are performed at radio frequencies (commonly around a few hundred MHz).
   - **Physical Observable**: Variations in radio scintillation that track density fluctuations in the solar wind associated with CMEs.
   - **Additional Comments**: As one of several modeling approaches, IPS‐based forecasts contribute an independent observational methodology to the overall CME scoreboard.

### 7. In‑Situ Measurements at 1 AU (e.g., Wind Spacecraft)
- **General Comments**:
   - In‑situ instruments such as those onboard the Wind spacecraft (or similar platforms) are used to detect the arrival of CME‐driven shocks at 1 AU. These measurements provide the “ground‐truth” arrival times against which forecasts are compared.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “...for a set of 76 Earth impacting CMEs, the mean error in accuracy was 3±16 hr...;” and “...identified in the Wind in‑situ measurements...” (used by other studies referenced in the discussion).
- **Data Collection Period 1: Shock Arrival Detection**
   - **Time Range**: Continuous monitoring at 1 AU; specific events are recorded as the shock passes Earth. The exact UT times are not provided in the paper.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (these are direct plasma and magnetic field measurements rather than electromagnetic wavelengths).
   - **Physical Observable**: Parameters such as solar wind speed, density, and magnetic field (used to identify the CME‑driven shock).
   - **Additional Comments**: The in‑situ data provide the benchmark for model validation, making precise determination of the arrival time critical.
