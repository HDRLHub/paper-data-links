## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper analyzes Fabry-Perot interferometric observations of the solar corona obtained during the total solar eclipse of 21 June 2001 in Lusaka, Zambia. The study focuses on the coronal green line (Fe XIV 5302.86 Å) to extract physical parameters such as the Doppler velocity, halfwidth, centroid, and asymmetry of the line profiles. The observations, performed over a spatial radial range of 1.1–1.5 R⊙, provided insights into the dominance of blueshifts and the dynamics of multi-component line profiles. Alongside these interferometric measurements, an Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image was used to map the spatial locations of the extracted profiles on the Sun.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Fabry-Perot Interferometer with CCD Detector
- **General Comments**:
   - The Fabry-Perot interferometer was used to record 14 interferograms during the total solar eclipse of 21 June 2001. These interferograms provided line profiles in the coronal green line (Fe XIV 5302.86 Å) to study various physical parameters (intensity, Doppler velocity, halfwidth, centroid, and asymmetry) of the inner solar corona.
   - A CCD was employed as the detector during these observations, and detailed instrumental features are provided (e.g., free spectral range, instrumental width, spectral resolution, CCD configuration, and pixel resolution).

- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The observations were carried out in the coronal green line, Fe XIV 5302.86 Å, during the total solar eclipse of 21 June 2001 which occurred in Lusaka, Zambia.”
   - “The Fabry-Perot interferometer used is the one used in Chandrasekhar et al. (1984). However, during the 21 June 2001 eclipse, a CCD was used as the detector.”
   - “Instrumental features of the Fabry-Perot interferometer used for our study. Features – Free spectral range: 4.75 Å, Instrumental width: 0.2 Å, Spectral resolution: 26,000, CCD configuration: 1024 x 1024, Pixel size: 24 µm, Pixel resolution: 3.4 arcsec.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Total Solar Eclipse Observation
- **Time Range**: 21 June 2001 – Total eclipse duration of 3 min 37 sec  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “These were taken during the total solar eclipse of 21 June 2001 that occurred in Lusaka, Zambia. It had a magnitude of 1.0495 and lasted for 3 min 37 sec when the Sun was at 31° elevation above the northwest horizon.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe XIV 5302.86 Å  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The observation is done in the coronal green line Fe XIV 5302.86 Å, which is chosen as its formation temperature (2 MK) is close to the average inner coronal temperature...”
- **Physical Observable**: Intensity, Doppler velocity, halfwidth, centroid, and asymmetry of the corona  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “From the data, we have obtained intensity, Doppler velocity, halfwidth, centroid and asymmetry at different points in the corona.”
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The interferograms provided a 240° angular coverage, and although a time-sequence was intended to study temporal variations, a tracking error rendered the interferograms non co-spatial. Nonetheless, this enabled analysis over a greater number of spatial locations across the corona.

### 2. Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT)
- **General Comments**:
   - The EIT was used to capture an image of the Sun concurrently with the eclipse observations. This imaging instrument served to overlay the spatial positions of the line profiles extracted from the interferograms, providing context for the location of the observed coronal structures.
   
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “All the spatial locations of the line proﬁles obtained are plotted on an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun obtained during the same time as that of the eclipse, which can be seen in Figure 2.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: EIT Imaging for Spatial Mapping
- **Time Range**: 21 June 2001, 13:48:13 UT  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 2. EIT image of the Sun on 21 June 2001 at time 13:48:13 showing the spatial locations of all the line proﬁles analyzed.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly provided in the paper  
   - **Supporting Quote**: The paper does not specify the wavelengths used by the EIT, only referencing it as an “Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope” image.
- **Physical Observable**: Solar disk imaging for the spatial localization of coronal line profiles  
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...plotted on an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun obtained during the same time as that of the eclipse...”
- **Additional Comments**:  
   - The EIT image assists in correlating the observed interferometric data with corresponding regions on the solar disk, thereby enhancing the spatial context of the coronal measurements.
