## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses a new empirical method to estimate the XUV (X-ray plus EUV) and FUV spectra of active Sun-like stars based on solar scaling relations with magnetic flux. The study utilizes over 10 years of Sun-as-a-star data to derive power-law relations for each wavelength within the XUV and FUV spectrum (0.1–180 nm). These relations are then applied to young Sun-like stars, demonstrating that the observed spectra are consistent with the model predictions, despite some errors. The paper highlights the importance of simultaneous observations of magnetic and XUV/FUV fluxes for further validation of the model.

## Instrumentation Details

### SORCE/XPS on board Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE)
- **General Comments**:
   - The XUV Photometer System (XPS) on SORCE is used to obtain daily averaged Sun-as-a-star spectra from X-ray to shortward EUV band (0.5-33.3 nm).

#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-term solar observation
- **Time Range**: May 2010 – February 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We used the daily averaged Sun-as-a-star spectra from X-ray to shortward EUV band (0.5-33.3 nm) obtained by the XUV Photometer System (XPS; Woods & Rottman 2005; Woods et al. 2008) onboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE; Rottman 2005) from May 2010 through February 2020."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.5-33.3 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The XPS level-4 spectrum was used in this study spans from over 0.1 to 40 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.1 nm."
- **Physical Observable**: X-ray and EUV solar spectra
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We used the daily averaged Sun-as-a-star spectra from X-ray to shortward EUV band (0.5-33.3 nm)."
- **Additional Comments**: The data were crucial for deriving the power-law relations for the XUV spectrum.

### SDO/EVE on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on SDO provides detailed measurements of the EUV solar spectrum.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed EUV spectral observation
- **Time Range**: May 2010 – February 2020
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We analyzed the daily averaged spectra of EUV bands (33.3-106.6 nm) obtained by the Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE; Woods et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) from May 2010 through February 2020."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 33.3-106.6 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The SDO/EVE instrument has performed Sun-as-a-star observations of the EUV solar spectrum from 6 nm to 106.6 nm since May 2010."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV solar spectra
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We analyzed the daily averaged spectra of EUV bands (33.3-106.6 nm)."
- **Additional Comments**: Data from SDO/EVE were used primarily for the EUV range due to its updated and better-calibrated system compared to other instruments.

### TIMED/SEE on board Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE) on TIMED provides Sun-as-a-star spectra covering a broad range of wavelengths.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Broad spectral range observation
- **Time Range**: January 2002 – December 2016
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We analyzed the daily spectrum of FUV (106.6–180 nm) obtained by TIMED/SEE (Woods et al. 2005, 2018) from January 2002 through December 2016."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 0.5-180 nm
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The TIMED/SEE provides Sun-as-a-star spectra at 0.5–190 nm since January 2002."
- **Physical Observable**: X-ray, EUV, and FUV solar spectra
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The TIMED/SEE provides Sun-as-a-star spectra at 0.5–190 nm."
- **Additional Comments**: Data after 2017 are not well calibrated, hence only data before 2016 were used.
