## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the formation of density structures (“blobs”) and intervening magnetic flux ropes released from the tips of coronal helmet streamers. It uses both remote‐sensing observations (e.g. from the Heliospheric Imager on STEREO-A) and in situ measurements at different heliospheric distances to study the evolution and substructure of these small transients. In situ data acquired during various sector boundary crossings—capturing signatures in the magnetic field (magnitude and rotation), proton density, proton speed, and suprathermal electron pitch angle distributions—are used to compare with remote imaging detections. The observations cover events at 1 AU (using spacecraft such as STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and Wind) and inside 1 AU (with Helios 1 and Helios 2), and the identified time ranges of the measurements are critical to matching the formation, release, and evolution of these transients in the heliosphere.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. STEREO-B In Situ Measurements (IMPACT Package including SWEA)
- **General Comments**:
  - STEREO-B’s in situ instrument package—often referred to in the context of the IMPACT suite (which includes the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer, SWEA)—was used to record detailed properties of the solar wind, including the magnetic field components, proton density, and suprathermal electron pitch angle distributions. These measurements were critical for identifying the passage of a High Density Region (HDR) and the subsequent flux rope during sector boundary crossings.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “Figure 2 presents STEREO-B in situ measurements, from 20:00 UT on 2011 May 19 to 20:00 UT on May 20. … At 02:30 UT on May 20 (first vertical black dashed line), the spacecraft enters a HDR with reduced magnetic field. At 04:30 UT (second dashed black line), STEREO-B exits this HDR and enters a region characterized by stronger magnetic fields …”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: HDR Followed by Flux Rope (Scenario 1)
- **Time Range**: 20:00 UT on 2011 May 19 – 20:00 UT on 2011 May 20
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 2 presents STEREO-B in situ measurements, from 20:00 UT on 2011 May 19 to 20:00 UT on May 20.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ particle and field measurements)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “...the pitch angle distribution of suprathermal electrons at ~250 eV…” (indicating the energy channel for electrons, not an optical wavelength).
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field magnitude and components, proton density, and suprathermal electron pitch angle distribution.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “... the radial component of the magnetic field (panel c) reverses … at the same time as the pitch angle of suprathermal strahl electrons reverses …”
- **Additional Comments**: The observations captured a 2-hour-long HDR followed by an 8-hour flux rope passage, interpreted as the spacecraft first encountering a blob and then a magnetic flux rope.

### 2. Wind In Situ Measurements (SWE and MFI Instruments)
- **General Comments**:
  - The Wind spacecraft provided complementary in situ data using its Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) and Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI). These instruments measured the plasma properties and magnetic field characteristics, respectively, which allowed for the identification of clear sector boundary (HCS) crossings as well as events where only flux ropes were encountered.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Figure 3 presents a case of Scenario 2, i.e. the crossing by the Wind spacecraft of a HCS… Simultaneous reversals of the radial magnetic field component and the pitch angle of the strahl occur at 14:00 UT on April 28.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Clean HCS Crossing (Scenario 2)
- **Time Range**: The crossing is centered around 14:00 UT on April 28, 2011  
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Simultaneous reversals … occur at 14:00 UT on April 28 (marked by a vertical black solid line).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
  - **Supporting Quote**: (Measurement details pertain to plasma and magnetic field data, not optical wavelengths.)
- **Physical Observable**: Reversal in both the radial magnetic field component and the suprathermal electron pitch angle; proton density increases preceding the HCS crossing.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “… reversal of the radial magnetic field component and the pitch angle of the strahl … proton density increases at a nearly constant rate from 03:00 UT to 14:00 UT on April 28.”
- **Additional Comments**: The absence of significant speed differences before and after the crossing indicates a coronal origin for the elevated densities.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Flux Rope Only Crossing (Scenario 5)
- **Time Range**: 16:00 UT on 2010 January 30 – 20:00 UT on January 31, 2010
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 6 presents in situ measurements … from 16:00 UT on 2010 January 30 to 20:00 UT on January 31.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Enhanced magnetic field exhibiting a flux rope structure (with a clear reversal in the magnetic field and electron strahl drop-out).
  - **Supporting Quote**: “… a reversal in the radial component of the magnetic field concomitant with a reversal in strahl pitch angle, at 01:30 UT on January 31 … This flux rope passage lasts for 6.5 hrs, from 01:30 to 08:00 UT.”
- **Additional Comments**: In this event no HDR is detected, demonstrating that sector boundaries can sometimes be sampled as flux ropes alone.

### 3. STEREO-A In Situ Measurements
- **General Comments**:
  - STEREO-A in situ measurements provided additional observations of the small transient structures in the slow solar wind. These data capture both blob (HDR) events with distinct durations and transitions to magnetic flux rope signatures.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Figure 4 presents in situ measurements of the solar wind by STEREO-A from 09:00 UT on 2011 June 27 to 03:00 UT on June 29 …” and “Figure 5 … presents STEREO-A in situ measurements from 11:00 UT on 2013 July 08 to 04:00 UT on July 10.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Blob Only (Scenario 3)
- **Time Range**: 09:00 UT on 2011 June 27 – 03:00 UT on 2011 June 29
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 4 presents in situ measurements … from 09:00 UT on 2011 June 27 to 03:00 UT on June 29.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Passage of a HDR (blob) with associated drop-out in suprathermal electron strahl, magnetic field weakening, and density enhancements with clear substructure.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “A HDR, detected between 03:45 and 12:00 UT on June 28, is delimited by the two dashed lines … associated with a weak interplanetary magnetic field.”
- **Additional Comments**: The blob is noted to be composed of three substructures with density peaks, possibly corresponding to smaller-scale periodic density structures (PDSs).

- **Time Range**: 11:00 UT on 2013 July 08 – 04:00 UT on 2013 July 10
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Figure 5 … presents STEREO-A in situ measurements from 11:00 UT on 2013 July 08 to 04:00 UT on July 10.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Initial encounter with an enhanced (~8 nT), smooth magnetic field indicative of a flux rope (from 18:00 UT on July 08 to 02:00 UT on July 09), immediately followed by a HDR passage (until 06:00 UT) with low magnetic field strength.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “From 18:00 UT on 2013 July 08 to 02:00 UT on July 09, the spacecraft encounters an enhanced (~8 nT) and smooth magnetic field … This flux rope is followed by a HDR that lasts for 4 hours, until 06:00 UT.”
- **Additional Comments**: A partial sampling at the blob edge is deduced from the presence of two separate density peaks.

### 4. Helios 1 In Situ Measurements
- **General Comments**:
  - Helios 1 recorded long-lasting HCS crossings at closer heliocentric distances (0.5 AU), providing vital data on the prolonged encounter with alternating blobs and flux ropes associated with the Heliospheric Plasma Sheet (HPS).
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Figure 7 shows one of these long-lasting sector boundaries observed by Helios 1 at 0.5 AU … The HPS extends from 01:00 UT on 1977 October 23 to 21:00 UT on November 03 …”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-lasting HCS Crossing
- **Time Range**: 01:00 UT on 1977 October 23 – 21:00 UT on November 03, 1977
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The HPS extends from 01:00 UT on 1977 October 23 to 21:00 UT on November 03 in the case of Helios 1.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ plasma and field measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Alternating periods of high density with low magnetic field (blobs) and smooth high magnetic field regions (flux ropes), accompanied by low proton temperature and variations in β.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The blobs and flux ropes … were associated with low temperatures … the plasma sheet, containing this succession of blobs separated by flux ropes, was systematically associated with low … proton temperatures.”
- **Additional Comments**: The radial size of blobs measured is estimated at around 18 Rₛ, in line with remote-sensing estimates.

### 5. Helios 2 In Situ Measurements
- **General Comments**:
  - Helios 2, operating at a heliocentric distance of approximately 0.35 AU, provided in situ observations of the same long-lasting HCS crossings. Its data allow for a comparison of blob durations and periodicities closer to the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “Figure 7 … by Helios 2 at 0.35 AU … The HPS … from 09:00 UT on 1977 October 29 to 08:00 UT on November 03 for Helios 2.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-lasting HCS Crossing
- **Time Range**: 09:00 UT on 1977 October 29 – 08:00 UT on November 03, 1977
  - **Supporting Quote**: “… from 09:00 UT on 1977 October 29 to 08:00 UT on November 03 for Helios 2.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (in situ measurements)
- **Physical Observable**: Observation of blobs (with lower magnetic field and high density) interspersed with smoother magnetic field intervals (flux ropes), along with measurements of proton density, speed, temperature, and plasma β.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “Blobs are detected every 18 hours by Helios 2 … These periodicities are very similar to the periodicity of blob release found by SD17A (19.5 hours).”
- **Additional Comments**: The blob duration at 0.35 AU is around 10 hours, indicative of an average radial extent consistent with remote-sensing measurements.
