## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the formation and subsequent eruption of a sigmoidal (inverse‑S shaped) structure within active region NOAA 11942. Using multi-wavelength observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and photospheric magnetic field measurements from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), both on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the study explores the evolution from a compact, bipolar region to a sheared arcade with inverse-J loops and a filament channel. It then tracks the filament’s slow rise, eventual reconnection, and eruption that produces a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed also in white‑light by LASCO onboard SOHO. Specific observational time periods range from early evolution on January 3–5, 2014, through filament activation and eruption on January 6, 2014 (with flare–ribbon and EUV diagnostics extending into January 7), and CME tracking during later phases.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA obtains full-disc extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images in 10 wavelength channels with a high cadence of 12 seconds and a pixel size of 0.6″.
   - It is used to monitor the coronal loop evolution, filament channel formation, reconnection signatures, and CME propagation across different temperature regimes.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. (2012)) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. (2012)) produces full-disc Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images in 10 wavelength bands at a high cadence of 12 seconds and pixel size of 0′′.6.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: AR Evolution and Sigmoid Build-Up
- **Time Range**: January 3, 2014 to January 5, 2014
   - *Start*: “03 Jan 2014 12:20UT” (simple potential configuration observed in AIA 171 Å images)
   - *End*: “05 Jan 2014 20:40UT” (transition to a sheared arcade with inverse‑S morphology)
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “Observations of AR 11942 evolution over days. Top row: line‑of‑sight magnetic ﬁeld observations … Bottom row: AIA 171˚A observations showing build‑up of inverse‑S shape sheared arcade from potential like loop structure on January 3.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 171˚A (Fe IX; T ∼0.6 MK) is used to capture the coronal loop configuration.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “... the coronal loop structure in AIA 171˚A images indicates a simple potential ﬁeld conﬁguration on January 3.”
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - Morphological evolution from potential field loops to sheared inverse‑S arcades.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The transition observed over these days marks the initial evolution in the active region.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Filament Initiation, Eruption, and Reconnection
- **Time Range**: January 6, 2014 – January 7, 2014
   - *Start*: Filament rise initiated around “05:35 UT on January 6” (as inferred from flux cancellation and shearing)
   - *Intermediate*: The filament is captured rising at “17:10 UT” in AIA 304˚A images.
   - *Eruption Onset*: Sigmoidal eruption is observed at “21:32 UT on January 6.”
   - *End*: Reconnection and cooling phases tracked until around “01:00 UT on January 7” (flare ribbon and EUV light curves continue into the early hours of January 7).
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “During this period, the ﬁlament channel appears to rise higher in height … from around 05:35 UT. In ﬁgure (3b), the rising ﬁlament is captured in AIA 304˚A image at 17:10UT. After 21:00UT the ﬁlament becomes invisible … eventually erupts at 21:32 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - 304˚A (He-II; T ∼0.05 MK): Used to observe filament material and flare ribbon evolution.
   - 94˚A (Fe XVIII; T ∼6.4 MK) and 131˚A (Fe XXI; T ∼10 MK): Sensitive to hot plasma and used to image reconnection-heated loops and post-eruption features.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “For the present study, we used the images obtained in 94˚A (Fe XVIII; T∼6.4MK), 131˚A (Fe XXI ;T∼10MK), 171˚A (Fe IX;T ∼0.6MK)... and 304˚A ( He-II;T∼0.05MK) wavebands.”
- **Physical Observable**:
   - EUV intensity enhancements corresponding to magnetic reconnection, filament rise, post-eruption loop formation, and cooling.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Running difference images in AIA 171˚A are also used to isotopically trace the expanding CME front.

### 2. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI provides photospheric magnetic field observations in both line-of-sight and vector measurements.
   - It is fundamental in tracking magnetic flux evolution, shearing, converging motions, and flux cancellation in the active region.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The corresponding photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observations are obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. (2012)) on board SDO.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - **Period for Flux Motion and Velocity Analysis**:
      - Data used at a cadence of 12 minutes; velocity maps are averaged over 4 hours to reveal large-scale horizontal flows.
      - **Supporting Quote**: 
         - “We use HMI LOS magnetogram maps at 12 minute cadence. In order to highlight large-scale and long term ﬂow pattern, the velocity maps are averaged over 4 hours.”
   - **Period for Magnetic Field Evolution and Flux Cancellation Analysis**:
      - Observations spanning from early disk passage (starting January 4, 2014) up to the initiation of main phase reconnection at “21:32 UT on January 6” and beyond into early January 7.
      - **Supporting Quote**:
         - “The frequent emergence and cancellation of ﬂuxes are evident in AR during its disk passage from January 4 to middle of January 7… where the net ﬂux starts decreasing … at 4:00 UT on January 6 till the onset (21:32UT) of the main phase reconnection.”

- **Physical Observable**:
   - Photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (Bz), horizontal velocity (derived via DAVE), net magnetic flux, and non-potential magnetic parameters.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The vector magnetic field data (hmi.sharp cea 720s series) are used for estimating parameters such as current density, net current neutralization, and average twist (αav) in the active region.

### 3. Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO provides white-light coronagraph images, capturing the large-scale outward propagation of CMEs.
   - It features two optical systems (C2 and C3) which observe different radial distances from the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The CME was observed in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectro‑metric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. (1995)) on board SOHO, which consists of two optical systems, C2 (2.2 −6.0 R⊙) and C3 (4 −32 R⊙).”

   - **Time Range**:
      - *Part 1*: Tracked until “January 7 at 00:42 UT” up to a height of 9 R⊙.

   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - “The part1 was ... tracked by coronagraph C3 until January 7 at 00:42 UT up to a height of 9 R⊙. The part2 was tracked by coronagraph C3 until January 7 at 8:00 UT upto a height of 22 R⊙.”

- **Wavelength/Detector**:
   - White-light imaging through two coronagraphs (C2 and C3) with fields-of-view tailored to different radial distances from the Sun.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - CME front expansion, propagating plasma structures, and kinematic properties (velocity and acceleration) of the CME as inferred from height–time measurements.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The distinct appearances in C2 and the extended tracking with C3 allow determination of CME kinematics and enable comparison of the observed weak/slow CME with typical CME parameters for strong eruptions.
