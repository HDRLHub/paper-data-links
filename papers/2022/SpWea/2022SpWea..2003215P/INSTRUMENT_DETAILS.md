## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper analyzes the eruption and propagation of two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun to Earth and Mars during August 2018, a period of solar minimum. The study focuses on the impact of these CMEs on space weather at both planets, highlighting the differences in their effects due to interactions with the solar wind and other heliospheric structures. The research utilizes remote-sensing and in-situ data from various spacecraft and ground-based instruments, supported by heliospheric modeling, to trace the CMEs' journey and their subsequent space weather effects.
