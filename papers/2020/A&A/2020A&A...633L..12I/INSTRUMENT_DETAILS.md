## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper uses measurements of the interstellar magnetic field obtained by spacecraft magnetometers along with a 3D kinetic‑magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) model of the global heliosphere to constrain the magnitude and direction of the pristine local interstellar magnetic field. In addition to direct measurements of magnetic field components in the outer heliosheath by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, the authors discuss indirect determinations from enhanced fluxes of heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) observed by IBEX and analysis of backscattered Lyman‑α emission by SOHO/SWAN. Other data sets – such as interstellar helium flow from Ulysses/GAS, solar wind, and plasma parameters from OMNI 2, IPS, and Voyager 2/PLS (plus additional Voyager 1/LECP energetic particle data) – support the modeling and provide context for the time-dependent variations of the termination shock and heliopause locations.

### 1. Voyager 1 Magnetometer (MAG) on board Voyager 1
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument provides in situ measurements of the interstellar magnetic field components (BR, BT, BN) after Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause.
   - Its data are essential for comparing the model predictions with observed magnetic field behavior along the Voyager 1 trajectory.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Voyager 1 Magnetometer (MAG) data plotted in Figure 3A were obtained from the NASA website: https://cohoweb.gsfc.nasa.gov. These data were presented and discussed in Burlaga et al. (2018, 2019)." 
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Post‑Heliopause Observations
- **Time Range**: August 2012 – End of 2017  
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Voyager 1 magnetometer data after the heliopause crossing are publicly available from 2012 until the end of 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (measures magnetic field vectors, not electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field strength and its three RTN components (BR, BT, BN).
- **Additional Comments**: Data are used to assess the spatial configuration of the interstellar magnetic field as the spacecraft travels beyond the heliopause.

### 2. Voyager 2 Magnetometer (MAG) on board Voyager 2
- **General Comments**:
   - This instrument records the vector components of the magnetic field (BR, BT, BN) along the Voyager 2 trajectory.
   - Its measurements, although more limited around the heliopause crossing, are used to validate the model, particularly close to the time of crossing.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Voyager 2/MAG data were obtained from Fig. 3 of Burlaga et al. (2019b)."
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Termination Shock and Heliopause Observations
- **Time Range**: 
   - Termination Shock: July–August 2007  
      - **Supporting Quote**: "The distances to the termination shock are ∼84 AU in September 2004, and ∼78 AU in July-August 2007."
   - Heliopause: November 2018  
      - **Supporting Quote**: "(Nov 2018, HP)" as indicated in Figure 3B.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (instrument measures magnetic field vectors).
- **Physical Observable**: Magnetic field components in the RTN coordinate system.
- **Additional Comments**: These measurements are compared with model results after an appropriate radial shift of the model distances (5 AU in Voyager 2 direction).

### 3. Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)
- **General Comments**:
   - IBEX detected a ribbon of enhanced fluxes of heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), which provides independent constraints on both the magnitude and the direction of the pristine interstellar magnetic field.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Another way to determine the magnitude and direction of the pristine interstellar field is to analyze the ribbon of enhanced ﬂuxes of heliospheric energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that was discovered by Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) (McComas et al. 2009)."
- **Time Range**: Specific observational dates are not provided in this paper.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (observations are of ENAs rather than a particular electromagnetic wavelength).
- **Physical Observable**: Enhanced fluxes of heliospheric energetic neutral atoms.
- **Additional Comments**: The ribbon structure observed by IBEX is used to infer the regions where the radial component of the interstellar magnetic field is close to zero.

### 4. SOHO/SWAN Instrument on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The SWAN instrument on SOHO observes backscattered Lyman‑α emission from interstellar hydrogen, which is subsequently used to determine heliolatitudinal variations of the solar wind mass flux.
   - These measurements indirectly contribute to understanding the interaction between the solar wind and the local interstellar medium.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Lallement et al. (2005, 2010) analyzed Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/ Solar Wind ANisotropy (SWAN) instrument data on backscattered Lyman‑α emission..."
   - Also, "Heliolatitudinal variations of the SW mass ﬂux are derived from analysis of SOHO/SWAN full-sky maps of the backscattered Lyman-alpha intensities... Data are available from 1995 to the end of 2017."
- **Time Range**: 1995 – End of 2017
- **Wavelength(s)**: Lyman‑α (approximately 121.6 nm)
   - **Supporting Quote**: "backscattered Lyman‑α emission" indicates the specific wavelength regime.
- **Physical Observable**: Intensity of backscattered Lyman‑α radiation, used to infer solar wind mass flux.
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument provides high temporal (∼1 day) and angular (10°) resolution maps of the heliosphere’s Lyman‑α brightness.

### 5. Ulysses/GAS Instrument on board Ulysses
- **General Comments**:
   - The GAS instrument on Ulysses measures the flow of interstellar helium, which is used to determine the direction of the interstellar bulk flow.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "The direction VLIS M is determined by the interstellar helium ﬂow direction from Ulysses/GAS data."
- **Time Range**: The paper does not specify an observation period for Ulysses/GAS data.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (the instrument measures particle fluxes rather than electromagnetic radiation).
- **Physical Observable**: Interstellar helium flow vectors.
- **Additional Comments**: The derived interstellar helium flow defines the VLIS M vector used in further model assumptions.

### 6. Voyager 2 Plasma Science (PLS) Instrument on board Voyager 2
- **General Comments**:
   - The Voyager 2/PLS instrument is used to measure plasma velocity components (VR, VT, and VN) in the inner heliosheath.
   - These measurements are key for comparing model results with the plasma flow in the region just behind the termination shock.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Comparison of the model results with Voyager 2/PLS data is shown in Figure B.1 (panel D)... Up to now these data were only available for the period up to October 1, 2018, that is before Voyager 2 crossed the heliopause."
- **Time Range**: Available data up to October 1, 2018 (before the Voyager 2 heliopause crossing).
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (the instrument measures plasma velocities, not electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: Plasma velocity components in the RTN coordinate system.
- **Additional Comments**: The instrument’s data provide context for modelling the plasma behavior in the inner heliosheath.

### 7. Voyager 1 Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) Instrument on board Voyager 1

   - These data have been used in studies to derive plasma velocity profiles along the Voyager 1 trajectory.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "Vr and VT derived by Krimigis et al. (2011) from analyses of energetic particle anisotropy measured by Voyager 1/LECP are shown as dots in panel C."
- **Time Range**: The paper does not specify exact date ranges for the Voyager 1/LECP data.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (this instrument measures energetic particle fluxes, not light).
- **Physical Observable**: Anisotropy in energetic charged particle flux.
- **Additional Comments**: The LECP data complement the magnetometer and plasma data by providing insight into energetic particle behavior in the heliosheath.
