## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines the presence of hot plasma in non-flaring active regions of the solar corona by utilizing high-cadence, monochromatic observations. The authors analyze data from the Mg xii spectroheliograph onboard CORONAS‑F/SPIRIT, which selectively images plasma at temperatures above 4 MK through the Mg xii 8.42 Å emission line. The study covers the period from 18 February 2002 to 28 February 2002 – a timeframe during which the instrument operated with a 105‑second cadence. In addition, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard SOHO is used to provide complementary observations of cooler (warm) plasma components. Together, these instruments enable the reconstruction of the differential emission measure (DEM) in active regions and set upper limits on the hot plasma contribution, which in turn provide constraints on the frequency and characteristics of nanoflare heating.
