## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a CME/flare event that occurred on September 27/28, 2012 by combining multiwavelength observations and radio triangulation techniques. The study employs white‐light coronagraph images, EUV and X‐ray observations as well as dynamic radio spectra to analyze the CME kinematics, shock propagation, and radio burst signatures (both type II and type III). The analysis makes extensive use of instruments onboard SOHO, STEREO, SDO, GOES, and several radio observatories, each contributing both spatial and temporal information that is critical for understanding the dynamics of the eruptive event and the associated radio emission.
