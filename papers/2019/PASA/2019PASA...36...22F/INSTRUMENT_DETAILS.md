## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper examines ten filament eruption events that led to both fast and slow coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In particular, it scrutinizes two well‐documented events occurring on 2013 September 29 and 2016 January 26. The study relies on multi-instrument observations: high-resolution full-disc Hα images from ground-based observatories (Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory and Big Bear Solar Observatory) capture filament activation and eruption details, while space-borne coronagraph data from the SOHO/LASCO C2 instrument record the CME evolution. In addition, line-of-sight magnetograms from SDO/HMI and contextual imaging from STEREO A (and an acknowledgment of SDO/AIA data) provide insights into the magnetic field structure and pre-eruptive conditions. Specific observation times include precise UT stamps such as 20:17:34 UT, 22:12 UT, and 19:24 UT on 2013 September 29 and around 11:34 UT and 16:30 UT on 2016 January 26, which are integral to correlating the filament dynamics with the onset of CMEs.

## Instrumentation Details

### 3. LASCO C2 Coronagraph – SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - The LASCO C2 coronagraph aboard SOHO is used to detect and characterize the appearance and propagation of CMEs in the corona. It provides white-light images that show the frontal structures and cores of CMEs.
   - This instrument is central to differentiating between fast and slow CME events.
