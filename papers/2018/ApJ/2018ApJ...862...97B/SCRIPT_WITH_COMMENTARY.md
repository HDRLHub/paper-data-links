This script queries SOHO LASCO data from the VSO using SunPy.
We choose the LASCO instrument with detector "C2" because its available time range 
("1995/12/08 - present") covers the period of interest derived from the SEP paper (2006â€“2014).
The query is set from 2006-07-01 to 2014-09-30 to match the SEP event observational period.

# and LASCO observations are used to determine related CME properties.

# Define the query attributes:
# - Source: SOHO, as LASCO is on board the SOHO mission.
# - Instrument: LASCO.
# - Detector: C2, as it covers the required time span.
# Additional wavelength filtering is not applied since LASCO C2 does not specify wavelength ranges.

# downloaded_files = Fido.fetch(query_result)
# However, the fetch command is commented out to avoid downloading data when executing the script.
# Uncomment the next line to perform the data download.
