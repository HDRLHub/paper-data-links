## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This invited review paper synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the origin and early structures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares from a multi-wavelength observational perspective. The research systematically discusses evidence supporting the existence and manifestations of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) prior to and during solar eruptions. Observational material analyzed includes recent high-cadence, high-resolution imagery and spectroscopy, notably from SDO/AIA and IRIS (space-based), with references to ground-based telescopes like NST and NVST. The review emphasizes direct usage and analysis of such observations to support its conclusions on MFR formation, evolution, and characteristics. Specific observation dates are mentioned, such as the analysis of active region 11520 in July 2012, and the review consistently links its findings to direct observation periods from modern solar missions, showing how continuous and multi-wavelength data underpin its synthesis.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA observations are used extensively throughout the paper for imaging, discovering, and analyzing hot channels, hot blobs, coronal cavities, plasma bubbles, filaments, sigmoidal structures, and dynamical events related to flux ropes and CMEs. The review directly utilizes specific AIA wavelengths to analyze temperature structure, emission measure, and the evolution and dynamics of pre-eruptive and eruptive MFRs, as well as their morphologies, heights, velocities, and emission signatures.
- **Supporting Quote**: "the current review...are mostly ascribed to the launch of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012)...First of all, we start with the questions of whether a highly helical MFR is necessary for the eruption and whether the MFR exists prior to the eruption. We then emphatically introduce the observational manifestations of the MFR."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Formation and Eruption of Hot Channels and Cavities
- **Time Range**: "Emssion measure maps at different temperature intervals and instants showing the formation of a sigmoidal hot channel-like MFR in the active region 11520, which can be clearly seen in panels g–i (adapted from Cheng et al. 2014b)."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Cheng et al. (2014b) found that the twisted field, indicated by continuous sigmoidal hot threads, is formed via the reconnection of two groups of sheared arcades near the PIL half day before the eruption."
- **Wavelength(s)**: "the hot blob is an unambiguous evidence of the MFR existing in the corona (also see; Song et al. 2014b). Following the work of Cheng et al. (2011b), Zhang et al. (2012) and Cheng et al. (2013a) started to search for more evidence of the MFR in the 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A passbands. They discovered that the MFR even exists prior to the eruption as a writhed channel-like structure..."  
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The visibility of the channel-like structure only at the AIA high temperature passbands (e.g., 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A) but not at other cooler passbands shows that it has a temperature of >6 MK....the emission of these hot MFRs are actually from a broad temperature range of 6.5 ≤log T ≤7.3 with a DEM-weighted average temperature larger than ∼8 MK."
- **Physical Observable**: Hot channels (MFRs), sigmoids, plasma bubbles, cavities, filament eruptions, CME onset.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Through analysing a limb event, Cheng et al. (2011b) for the first time observed the formation of an MFR during the impulsive phase. It initially appears as an erupting hot blob as seen in the AIA 131 ˚A and 94 ˚A passbands (T≥8 MK). While in the other low temperature passbands (1MK≤ T ≤5 MK), it appears as a dark cavity."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for both temperature diagnostics (DEM) and multi-wavelength morphology/evolution studies.

#### Data Collection Period 2: CME Formation, Kinematics, and Early Dynamics (2011–2012)
- **Time Range**: "Applying the mathematic model to two MFR eruption events, Cheng et al. (2013b) quantitatively determined the onset time of the MFR impulsive acceleration, and found that the onset time is ∼2 minutes earlier than that of the associated flares."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Applying the mathematic model to two MFR eruption events, Cheng et al. (2013b) quantitatively determined the onset time of the MFR impulsive acceleration..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: "With the high cadence SDO-AIA data, Patsourakos et al. (2010b) found that the plasma bubble even experiences an evolution of three phases: a slow self-similar expansion, a fast but short-lived period of strong lateral overexpansion, and a self-similar expansion."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In the AIA high temperature passbands, a hot channel appears as the S-shaped structure with its axis almost parallel with the PIL. After experiencing a short period of rising motion, the hot channel develops into the semi-circular structure and then quickly expands outward and speeds up. At the same time, in the AIA low temperature passbands, it is clearly seen that a plasma bubble appears and also has a fast expansion and ascending motion, very similar to the events analysed by Patsourakos et al. (2010a) and Patsourakos et al. (2010b)."
- **Physical Observable**: Height, velocity, acceleration of MFRs and CMEs; emission measure evolution; temperature structuring; plasma bubble dynamics.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Cheng et al. (2013a) investigated in detail two CME events and found that the formation of the CMEs are completely controlled by the dynamics of the hot channels."
- **Additional Comments**: Event context includes quantitative kinematic modeling and DEM-based plasma diagnostics.

### EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode
- **General Comments**:
  - EIS data are used for spectroscopic diagnostics of non-thermal velocities, Doppler shifts, and plasma flows indicating flux rope formation and energetics at MFR footpoints and reconnection sites, particularly for hot channel events in the pre-flare phase.
- **Supporting Quote**: "By analysing Coronal Diagnostics Spectrometer (CDS) or EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) data, Gibson et al. (2002), Harra et al. (2009), and Harra et al. (2013) found a significant pre-flare enhancement in non-thermal velocity, the locations of which may correspond to the footpoints of the MFR."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Pre-eruption Hot Channel (MFR) Diagnostics
- **Time Range**: "Syntelis et al. (2016) even found that the enhanced non-thermal velocities, as well as the blueshifts, can last for 5 hours before the eruption of the hot channel-like MFR."
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Combining EIS and AIA observations, Syntelis et al. (2016) even found that the enhanced non-thermal velocities, as well as the blueshifts, can last for 5 hours before the eruption of the hot channel-like MFR."

  - **Supporting Quote**: "Syntelis et al. (2016) even found that the enhanced non-thermal velocities, as well as the blueshifts, can last for 5 hours before the eruption of the hot channel-like MFR."
- **Additional Comments**: Used in combination with SDO/AIA imaging to analyze pre-eruptive MFR formation.

### Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) on board IRIS spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - IRIS spectroscopic observations are used for spatially resolved plasma diagnostics in the formation and early evolution of pre-eruptive hot channels (MFRs), focusing on chromospheric and transition region lines (e.g., Si IV, C II, Mg II) to study Doppler velocities, nonthermal velocities, and evidence of reconnection.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Cheng et al. (2015a) further performed spectroscopic diagnostics on the formation of hot channels based on the AIA and IRIS joint observations. At the footpoints of the hot channel, it is found that the Si IV, C II, and Mg II lines exhibit weak to moderate redshifts and non-thermal velocities in the pre-flare phase. However, relatively large blueshifts and extremely strong non-thermal velocities appear at the reconnection site of two sheared arcades, i.e., the formation site of the hot channel."
