## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of 31 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed near Earth between 2008 and mid-2012, which are definitively connected to magnetic clouds (MCs) detected in situ by the Wind spacecraft. The primary research objective is to perform full 3-D reconstructions of CME structures and kinematics using imaging from the STEREO-A and STEREO-B spacecraft, as well as from SOHO/LASCO, for all events in this period where CMEs can be tracked continuously from the Sun to near 1 AU. Wind in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements are used to identify and characterize MCs and their arrival at Earth. The observational data set includes direct imaging of solar eruptions (at specific white-light wavelengths, field of view regimes, and detection times), as well as in situ solar wind, plasma, and magnetic field measurements across precise time intervals matched to each CME-MC event. Data were collected and analyzed from 2008 January 1 to 2012 July 12, corresponding to the period when the two STEREO spacecraft were optimally positioned to observe Earth-directed CMEs.

### SECCHI (Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation) suite on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
  - Data from all four telescopes in the SECCHI suite (COR1, COR2, HI1, HI2) on both STEREO-A and STEREO-B were used to track the 31 identified CMEs from their initiation at the Sun through their propagation to near 1 AU. These observations provided white-light images used for morphological and kinematic 3-D reconstructions, specifically focused on each event's timeline.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We find 31 out of 48 Wind MCs during this period can be clearly connected with a CME that is trackable in STEREO imagery all the way from the Sun to near 1 AU."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full tracking of each Earth-directed CME
- **Time Range**: 2008-01-01 – 2012-07-12 (event-specific times detailed per CME, starting from first appearance in COR1 to disappearance in HI2 fields of view)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Thus, the first step in defining our sample of events was to identify MCs observed by Wind between 2008 January 1 and 2012 July 12."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light continuum (broadband) imaging at various fields of view:
    - COR1: "There are two coronagraphs, COR1 and COR2, that observe the Sun’s white light corona at angular distances from Sun-center of 0.37◦−1.07◦and 0.7◦−4.2◦, respectively, corresponding to distances in the plane of the sky of 1.4−4.0 R⊙ for COR1 and 2.5−15.6 R⊙ for COR2."
    - HI1: "where HI1 observes elongation angles from Sun-center of 3.9◦−24.1◦ and HI2 observes from 19◦−89◦."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Each STEREO spacecraft carries four white light telescopes that observe at different distances from the Sun... COR1 and COR2... HI1 and HI2 (Eyles et al. 2009)... COR1 and COR2...white light corona... HI1 observes elongation angles from Sun-center of 3.9◦−24.1◦ and HI2 observes from 19◦−89◦."
- **Physical Observable**: White-light brightness due to Thomson-scattering off CME plasma; propagation and morphological evolution of CME fronts.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The term 'coronal mass ejection' (CME) was created to describe visible eruptions of mass from the Sun observed in white-light coronagraphic images of the outer solar corona (Tousey 1973;...)"  
    "Our goal is to use STEREO and LASCO data to provide a full 3-D kinematic and morphological analysis of a sample of CMEs observed as MCs at Earth, specifically by Wind."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The COR1 CME start times and HI2 final tracking provide the basis for kinematic modeling and morphological fitting for each event.
  - **Supporting Quote:**  
    "The CME start time listed in Table 1 corresponds to the time that expansion is first perceived close to the Sun in COR1 images."
    "We look at movies of HI2-A and HI2-B images near the time of the MC to see if we can see a front passing over Earth at about that time, which we then seek to track backwards to HI1, then to COR2, and finally to COR1 to identify the CME associated with that front and its initiation time at the Sun."

### LASCO (Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/LASCO imagery from its coronagraphs (C2 and C3) was used alongside STEREO observations for each CME event. LASCO data provided the third viewpoint necessary for triangulation and a constraint for 3-D reconstructions of CME morphology and propagation.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "assuming a flux rope morphology for the CME shape, considering the full complement of STEREO and SOHO imaging constraints."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Coordinated observations with STEREO for each CME
- **Time Range**: 2008-01-01 – 2012-07-12, used for all events tracked in STEREO campaign, with event-based times corresponding typically to initial CME appearance through final tracking in conjunction with STEREO
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We want events well constrained by STEREO and SOHO/LASCO imagery, and we want CMEs trackable out to distances close to 1 AU in the HI2 field of view."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light coronagraphic imaging (C2: 2.2–6 R⊙; C3: 3.7–32 R⊙)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Coronagraphic imaging, particularly from SOHO/LASCO, has been used to provide support for the FR paradigm (Chen et al. 1997; Gibson & Low 1998; Wu et al. 2001; Manchester et al. 2004a; Krall 2007). In particular, large, bright CMEs seen in LASCO images are often found to have large circular rims, which can be interpreted as outlining the apexes of FRs viewed edge-on (Wood et al. 1999; Thernisien et al. 2006)."
- **Physical Observable**: White-light brightness due to CME plasma; used for stereoscopy, trajectory, and morphology analysis.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Synthetic images are then generated from the density cube using a white-light rendering routine to perform the necessary calculations of Thomson scattering within the density cube (Billings 1966; Thernisien et al. 2006). In this way, we can generate synthetic images of the CME at any time and from any perspective that we want, for comparison with images from STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO/LASCO."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - LASCO images were critical for cases when Earth-directed CMEs were faint or best seen from Earth's perspective.
  - **Supporting Quote:**  
    "SOHO/LASCO (near Earth) viewing geometry for each event, with the HI1 and HI2 fields of view explicitly displayed for both STEREO-A and -B."

### MFI (Magnetic Field Investigation) and SWE (Solar Wind Experiment) on board Wind spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - Wind MFI and SWE instruments delivered in situ measurements of magnetic fields and plasma properties at Earth's L1 point. These data were used to identify, time, and analyze every MC (and broader ICME arrival), including magnetic field rotation, low plasma beta, and enhanced field strength, for the entire interval 2008-01-01 to 2012-07-12.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "We identify coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with magnetic clouds (MCs) observed near Earth by the Wind spacecraft from 2008 to mid-2012, a time period when the two STEREO spacecraft were well positioned to study Earth-directed CMEs."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Continuous monitoring for MC/ICME identification
- **Time Range**: 2008-01-01 – 2012-07-12 (event-specific intervals per MC and associated ICME as detailed in Table 1)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Thus, the first step in defining our sample of events was to identify MCs observed by Wind between 2008 January 1 and 2012 July 12. Our sources are the Wind MC lists from Lepping et al. (2011, 2015), involving the use of both an automated procedure (Lepping et al. 2005) and visual inspection to find MCs in the Wind database."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Wind measurements of proton density, velocity, and magnetic field are shown in Figure 1 for our 28 CMEs."
- **Physical Observable**:  
    - Magnetic field vectors (Bx, By, Bz, Btot), proton density, and velocity (in situ properties for MC identification)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The Wind measurements of proton density, velocity, and magnetic field are shown in Figure 1 for our 28 CMEs. The MC time intervals from Lepping et al. (2011, 2015) are indicated in the figure."
    "From in situ data alone, there is no definitive procedure for unambiguously distinguishing ICMEs from the background solar wind and other transients such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs) or stream interaction regions (SIRs). Many ICMEs are characterized by a region of low plasma β and strong, rotating magnetic fields, and these properties define an ICME subclass called 'magnetic clouds' (MCs) (Burlaga et al. 1981; Marubashi 1986; Burlaga 1988; Lepping et al. 1990; Bothmer & Schwenn 1998)."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - All MC boundaries, arrival times, and event IDs are assigned by direct analysis of these in situ data.
  - **Supporting Quote:**  
    "The ICME arrival time at Earth is estimated from Wind data time-shifted to the bow shock nose, extracted from NASA/GSFC’s OMNI database."
    "The plasma and field instruments on such spacecraft can study solar transients such as CMEs in situ, with in situ detections of CMEs often referred to as 'interplanetary coronal mass ejections,' or ICMEs."

### EUVI (Extreme UltraViolet Imager) on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
  - EUVI imaging on both STEREO spacecraft was used to detect and time solar surface activity related to the origin of each analyzed CME, including flares and filament eruptions, providing context for CME initiation and source localization.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Finally, for all our events, we have looked for solar surface activity associated with each CME, particularly in EUV movies from the EUVI imagers on STEREO, as well as images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We look for surface activity at the right time and location to connect with the CMEs in our list."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Event-specific onset of solar surface activity
- **Time Range**: For each CME event, EUVI observations are used at the event's surface source time (see Table 1 'Surface Activity Time' column), e.g., "2008-12-12T03:00" for Event #1.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The start time of the activity is listed, which is naturally very close to the CME start time in all instances."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple EUV passbands (specific wavelengths not specified in the main text)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "particularly in EUV movies from the EUVI imagers on STEREO..."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission revealing solar flares, prominence/filament eruptions, and other surface activity.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We look for surface activity at the right time and location to connect with the CMEs in our list."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Used for categorizing events and for associating CME onset times and locations.
  - **Supporting Quote:**  
    "Table 1 indicates which events are convincingly associated with significant flares in the EUV, and which are associated with clear filament eruptions."

### AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA EUV images were surveyed for each event to support identification and timing of associated flares and filament eruptions at the solar surface, providing context for associating solar phenomena with CME initiation.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "as well as images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We look for surface activity at the right time and location to connect with the CMEs in our list."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Event-specific surface activity imaging
- **Time Range**: For each CME event, during relevant surface activity window as listed in Table 1 'Surface Activity Time'
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The start time of the activity is listed, which is naturally very close to the CME start time in all instances."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple EUV channels (AIA typically observes at 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335 Å, though not specified in the main text)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "as well as images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar surface and low-coronal EUV emission; flare and filament eruption identification and timing.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We look for surface activity at the right time and location to connect with the CMEs in our list."

  - Used in combination with EUVI imagery for robust identification of surface sources.
  - **Supporting Quote:**  
    "Table 1 indicates which events are convincingly associated with significant flares in the EUV, and which are associated with clear filament eruptions."
