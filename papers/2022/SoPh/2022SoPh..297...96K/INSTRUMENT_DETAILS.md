## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper explores the diagnostic capabilities of spectral lines in the far ultraviolet (FUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelength ranges for probing the vector magnetic field in the solar corona. The study focuses on the Hanle and Zeeman effects to measure the magnetic field, covering a temperature range of log10(T) = 5.5−6.3. The paper discusses the circular polarization signal due to the longitudinal Zeeman effect and the linear polarization signals due to the Hanle effect. It aims to find combinations of spectral lines with different Hanle sensitivities but identical peak formation temperatures to probe the coronal magnetic field vector. The study compiles spectral lines observed from three different space-based missions: the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard the Hinode spacecraft, the Extreme Ultraviolet Normal Incidence Spectrograph (EUNIS) sounding rocket, and the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).

## Instrumentation Details

### EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode
- **General Comments**:
   - The EIS is designed to observe in two wavelength ranges (SW: 166 – 212 Å; LW: 245 – 291 Å). It consists of several emission lines from highly ionized species ranging from 4.7 to 7.3 in the logarithmic scale of temperature (log10(T)).
- **Supporting Quote**: "One is the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane, 2007), onboard the Hinode spacecraft, which is designed to observe in two wavelength ranges (SW: 166 – 212 Å; LW: 245 – 291 Å)."
