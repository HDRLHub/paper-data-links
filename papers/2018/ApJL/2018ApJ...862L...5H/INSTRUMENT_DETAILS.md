## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the signatures of Solar Cycle 25 in subsurface zonal flows, commonly known as the torsional oscillation. The study analyses nearly 23 years of helioseismic observations to track migrating bands of faster and slower rotation, which are believed to be closely related to the onset and evolution of solar cycles. The data were obtained from several major helioseismic instruments and synoptic magnetic observations spanning multiple solar cycles. The key instruments include the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, the unsigned magnetic field strength from National Solar Observatory (NSO) synoptic observations is used for comparison against the flow patterns. The time periods covered by these instruments are integral to comparing the dynamics of Cycle 23, Cycle 24, and the emerging Cycle 25.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)
- **General Comments**:
   - GONG provides continuous global helioseismic observations that are critical for monitoring the rotational splitting of solar acoustic modes. In this study, GONG data are used to infer two-dimensional rotation profiles at various depths in the solar convection zone, particularly focusing on the torsional oscillation signatures associated with different solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "We analyzed 224 GONG data sets of rotational splitting values for degrees l ≤150, with the ﬁrst starting in May 1995 and the last ending in August 2017."
        
#### Data Collection Period: Continuous Helioseismic Observations (May 1995 – August 2017)
- **Time Range**: May 1995 – August 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "with the ﬁrst starting in May 1995 and the last ending in August 2017."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: *(No specific wavelength details provided.)*
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - The instrument measures rotational splitting of acoustic modes, yielding rotation rate residuals (torsional oscillations) that trace the migrating zonal flow bands as a function of depth and latitude.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The pattern of migrating zonal ﬂow bands ... has been monitored with continuous global helioseismic observations by the Global Oscillations Network Group."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Data were collected in 108-day time series with start dates at 36-day intervals, contributing to a long-term record that spans nearly two full solar cycles.

### 2. Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - MDI, onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), is a helioseismic instrument that has been used to study the Sun’s internal rotation by analyzing the splitting of solar acoustic modes. Within this study, MDI provides critical data that bridge observations between different solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "for MDI we considered 74 sets of rotational-splitting coefficients up to l = 300, from May 1996 to February 2011."
        
#### Data Collection Period: MDI Observations (May 1996 – February 2011)
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – February 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "from May 1996 to February 2011."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: *(No specific wavelength details provided.)*
- **Physical Observable**:
   - MDI data are used to extract rotational splitting coefficients, which serve as indicators of subsurface rotational dynamics and help trace the torsional oscillation patterns.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "rotational-splitting coefficients up to l = 300" and its integration into the helioseismic inversions for rotation‐rate residuals.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The MDI data are part of a combined data set with HMI, with a one-year overlap used to correct for systematic offsets.

### 3. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO
- **General Comments**:
   - HMI, onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), is the successor to MDI for helioseismic studies. It provides high-resolution measurements of the solar photospheric magnetic field and velocity fields, enabling detailed analysis of the torsional oscillations and the flow patterns associated with solar cycles.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "while the 41 sets of HMI observations start in April 2010 and end with May 2018."
        
#### Data Collection Period: HMI Observations (April 2010 – May 2018)
- **Time Range**: April 2010 – May 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "the 41 sets of HMI observations start in April 2010 and end with May 2018."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: *(No specific wavelength details provided.)*
- **Physical Observable**:
   - HMI is used to derive rotational splitting and infer the solar rotation rate at different depths. The resulting rotation rate residuals provide insights into the migrating zonal flow bands (torsional oscillations) as the Sun transitions between cycles.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "obtained by ... the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - HMI data, along with MDI, help in providing a continuous record of the solar rotational dynamics through a carefully managed overlapping period that mitigates systematic errors.

### 4. National Solar Observatory (NSO) Synoptic Magnetic Observations
- **General Comments**:
   - The NSO synoptic magnetic observations provide measurements of the unsigned magnetic field strength over the solar disk. These observations are used in the study to compare the helioseismic flow patterns with the migration of magnetic activity on the Sun.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "To compare the ﬂow patterns with the migration of magnetic activity we use the unsigned ﬁeld strength taken from National Solar Observatory (NSO) synoptic magnetic observations."
        
#### Data Collection Period: Not Specified
- **Time Range**: The paper does not provide a specific start or end date for the NSO synoptic magnetic observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - *(No explicit time range provided for NSO observations.)*
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not explicitly specified in the paper.
   - **Supporting Quote**: *(No specific wavelength details provided.)*
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The NSO data measure the unsigned magnetic field strength, which acts as a tracer of magnetic activity on the solar surface. This observable is important for correlating the magnetic features with the torsional oscillation flow patterns.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "the unsigned ﬁeld strength taken from National Solar Observatory (NSO) synoptic magnetic observations."
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These observations were supplementary to the helioseismic data, providing a magnetic context to the rotational dynamics observed by GONG, MDI, and HMI.
