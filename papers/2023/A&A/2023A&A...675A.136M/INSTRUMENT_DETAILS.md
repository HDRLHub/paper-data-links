## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the interactions and rotations of two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that occurred on September 8 and 10, 2014, from the active region NOAA 12158. The study aims to understand how these interactions affect the geoeffectiveness of the CMEs as they propagate through the heliosphere. The authors utilize the EUHFORIA model to simulate the CMEs and compare the results with in situ measurements at 1 AU. The findings highlight discrepancies in the predicted and observed magnetic field orientations and the importance of accurate initial conditions for space weather forecasting.
