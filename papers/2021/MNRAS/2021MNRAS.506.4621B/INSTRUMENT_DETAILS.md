## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports multi-epoch observations of GRB 191221B using a suite of instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum. The main focus is on optical spectropolarimetry and photometry to track the evolution of the GRB afterglow along with supporting gamma‐ray and radio data to understand the shock physics and jet structure. Key time periods include sub‐minute to several hours post burst for optical photometry, spectropolarimetry beginning as early as ~3 hours and again near 10 hours post burst, and radio follow‐up spanning from ~30 days to ~444 days post burst. Additional gamma‐ray detections (and other alerts) by instruments such as CALET, Swift/BAT, AGILE/MCAL, AstroSat CZTI, Insight-HXMT/HE, and Konus-Wind provided the burst trigger. Other instruments like Swift’s XRT and UVOT, VLT/X-shooter, ATCA, and ALMA contributed additional information on afterglow brightness and redshift confirmation.
