## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper examines a series of intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events in early September 2017 – a period marked by exceptional solar activity from Active Region NOAA 12673. Utilizing multi‐spacecraft observations, the study combines in situ proton measurements from near‐Earth platforms (ACE and GOES) with complementary data from STEREO-A, and remote‐sensing imaging from instruments such as SOHO/LASCO, SDO/HMI, and GOES-16/SUVI. Ground-based neutron monitors further verify the occurrence of a ground level enhancement (GLE) during the October SEP event. The work focuses on deriving the event-integrated energy spectra—from several hundred keV up to nearly 1 GeV—and assessing features such as low-energy breaks and high-energy rollovers. It further discusses how interplanetary structures (ICMEs, high-speed streams, shocks) and magnetic connectivity affect the observed spectral shapes.
