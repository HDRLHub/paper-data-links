   - Physical Observables:  
     • VHE photon flux measurements used to test SSC models and compare against the synchrotron limit.  

7. Konus-Wind  
   - Time Ranges:  
     • While not directly detailed for GRB 190829A, Konus-Wind data appear in the context of comparison in the Eₚₑₐₖ–E_iso relation (Fig. 4) alongside Swift BAT and other GRB samples.  
   - Detectors & Energy Range:  
     • A gamma-ray instrument aboard Wind, sensitive to a broad range of energies, used historically for GRB spectral analysis.  
   - Physical Observables:  
     • Provides Eₚₑₐₖ and E_iso values that help classify GRBs into low-, intermediate-, and high-luminosity categories.  

8. MAGIC Telescopes  
   - Time Ranges:  
     • Not used in the direct observation of GRB 190829A but discussed in the sensitivity comparison; if the burst had been early located by MAGIC, predictions suggest detectability around t ≈ 10³ s.

     • Ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) with a sensitivity at ~100 GeV.

9. Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)  
   - Time Ranges:  
     • Model predictions indicate that for transient events like GRB 190829A, CTA would be capable of detecting emission at ~10³ s, given its sensitivity parameters.  
   - Detectors & Energy Range:  
     • Next-generation IACT facility anticipated to have high sensitivity for VHE gamma rays (energy thresholds around 75 GeV).

10. High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory  
    - Time Ranges:  
      • Mentioned in the context of sensitivity estimates for GRB observations; the analysis indicates that even if GRB 190829A had occurred when HAWC was operational in its field of view, its flux would be below HAWC’s detection threshold.  
    - Detectors & Energy Range:  
      • Uses water Cherenkov detectors sensitive to VHE gamma rays, though with different sensitivity limits compared to IACTs.  
    - Physical Observables:  
      • VHE gamma-ray flux predictions are compared against HAWC sensitivity curves, suggesting non-detectability in this case.
