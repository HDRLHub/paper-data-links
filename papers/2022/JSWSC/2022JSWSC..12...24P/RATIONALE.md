# Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the script. We need to construct queries for the data mentioned in the context using the SunPy library and the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) interface. The context provides specific instruments and time ranges for which we need to query the data. We will use the `Fido.search` method from SunPy to perform these queries. The script will be structured to query data for the following instruments:
# - GOES/EPS for SEP event cataloging
# - SOHO/LASCO for CME identification and characterization
# - GOES for Solar X-ray (SXR) flux measurements

# Script: Written in python sunpy, don't run Fido.fetch commands. Print out the query results and have commented out Fido.fetch commands. The code should be explicit and expressive, well-commented, avoiding nested calls and loops. The code MUST reflect the data used in the context. DO NOT STRAY FROM THIS DIRECTIVE! Only be as specific as the context allows. The only required values are the time range and the instrument. Take note if some instruments are not available in provided VSO interface. THIS MUST BE ONE SINGLE VALID EXECUTABLE PYTHON SCRIPT AND NO NOTHING ELSE!

```python
import sunpy.net
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Query for GOES/EPS data for SEP event cataloging
# Time Range: 1984 – 2013
# Physical Observable: Proton peak flux and total fluence
# Note: GOES/EPS is not explicitly listed in the provided VSO interface, but we will use GOES as the source.

# Define the time range for the query
time_range_goes_eps = a.Time('1984-01-01', '2013-12-31')

# Define the instrument
instrument_goes_eps = a.Instrument('goes')

# Perform the query
query_goes_eps = Fido.search(time_range_goes_eps, instrument_goes_eps)

# Print the query results
print("GOES/EPS Data for SEP Event Cataloging:")
print(query_goes_eps)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_goes_eps = Fido.fetch(query_goes_eps)

# Query for SOHO/LASCO data for CME identification and characterization
# Time Range: 1997 – 2013
# Physical Observable: CME plane-of-sky speeds and angular widths

# Define the time range for the query
time_range_soho_lasco = a.Time('1997-01-01', '2013-12-31')

# Define the instrument
instrument_soho_lasco = a.Instrument('lasco')

# Perform the query
query_soho_lasco = Fido.search(time_range_soho_lasco, instrument_soho_lasco)

# Print the query results
print("SOHO/LASCO Data for CME Identification and Characterization:")
print(query_soho_lasco)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_soho_lasco = Fido.fetch(query_soho_lasco)

# Query for GOES Solar X-ray (SXR) flux measurements for solar flare recording
# Time Range: 1984 – 2013
# Physical Observable: Solar flare magnitude and location

# Define the time range for the query
time_range_goes_sxr = a.Time('1984-01-01', '2013-12-31')

# Define the instrument
instrument_goes_sxr = a.Instrument('goes')

# Perform the query
query_goes_sxr = Fido.search(time_range_goes_sxr, instrument_goes_sxr)

# Print the query results
print("GOES Solar X-ray (SXR) Flux Measurements for Solar Flare Recording:")
print(query_goes_sxr)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files_goes_sxr = Fido.fetch(query_goes_sxr)
```

This script queries the VSO for data from the specified instruments and time ranges as described in the context. The `Fido.search` method is used to perform the queries, and the results are printed out. The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out to avoid downloading the data.
