## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the coronal mass ejection (CME) event of April 23, 2009, which exhibited a complex acceleration profile. The study utilizes direct observations and measurements from multiple spaceborne instruments to analyze CME kinematics, acceleration phases, associated flare activity, prominence evolution, and CME-CME collision dynamics. The analysis is particularly notable for the use of the TESIS EUV telescope, which provided coronal imaging in the Fe 171 Å line up to 2 solar radii, allowing the continuous tracking of the CME from its solar surface origins through the LASCO/C2 coronagraph field of view. Supporting observations from He 304 Å imaging (TESIS and SOHO/EIT), soft X-ray flux (SphinX spectrophotometer), monochromatic hot plasma imaging (TESIS Mg XII spectroheliograph), and multi-perspective data from STEREO/EUVI, COR1, and COR2 coronagraphs were utilized. Measurements span the complete CME evolution—including pre-eruption, initiation, impulsive acceleration and deceleration, through post-collision—over the full date context of April 23, 2009. Each instrument’s data directly forms the empirical basis for analysis and results (not only reviewed from literature).

### TESIS EUV Telescope on board CORONAS-PHOTON

- **General Comments**:
  - The TESIS EUV telescope was used for observing the coronal structure and prominence evolution, particularly in the Fe 171 Å and He 304 Å lines, with a unique ability to image up to 2 R⊙, thus enabling full tracking of the CME from low to higher corona.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "TESIS is an instrument assembly that observed the solar corona in the soft X-ray and EUV. It worked on board the CORONAS-PHOTON satellite (Kotov 2011). The TESIS EUV telescope imaged the solar corona in the Fe 171 ˚A and He 304 ˚A lines. The special feature of the TESIS EUV telescope was its ability to image the corona up to a distance of 2 R⊙from the Sun’s center in the Fe 171 ˚A line (for details, see Reva et al. 2014). We use the TESIS data to observe coronal magnetic structure and prominence evolution at high altitudes."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Continuous CME evolution (core tracking and prominence dynamics)
- **Time Range**: April 23, 2009 (continuous throughout CME evolution, specific times from ≈02:51 UT prominence lift-off to ≈07:38 UT core moving into LASCO)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "The prominence started to lift at 02:51 UT on April 23, 2009. At 04:28 UT, in the Fe 171 ˚A images, a ﬂuxrope formed."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Fe 171 Å; He 304 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "The TESIS EUV telescope imaged the solar corona in the Fe 171 ˚A and He 304 ˚A lines."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal magnetic structure, prominence evolution, filament eruption, CME core rise, and draining.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "We use the TESIS data to observe coronal magnetic structure and prominence evolution at high altitudes."
- **Additional Comments**: The 304 Å channel had a 4 min cadence and data gaps were filled with SOHO/EIT 304 Å.

### TESIS Mg XII Spectroheliograph on board CORONAS-PHOTON

- **General Comments**:
  - Used to study X-ray emission and hot plasma associated with the CME, imaging the corona in the Mg XII 8.42 Å line.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "The Mg XII spectroheliograph was a part of the TESIS assembly. The instrument built monochromatic images of the solar corona in the Mg XII 8.42 ˚A line. This line emits at temperatures higher than 4 MK, and the Mg XII images contain only the signal from the hot plasma without any low temperature background... We use the spectroheliograph Mg XII to study the X-ray emission associated with the analyzed CME."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare-associated hot plasma imaging and arcade formation
- **Time Range**: April 23, 2009, 07:00 UT – 09:00 UT (CME impulsive acceleration/flare activity)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "We observed an X-source in the Mg XII spectroheliograph images from 07:00 to 09:00 UT (see Figure 8). This source corresponds to the ﬂare arcade below the CME. It was the only X-ray source on the Sun."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Mg XII 8.42 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "The Mg XII spectroheliograph was a part of the TESIS assembly. The instrument built monochromatic images of the solar corona in the Mg XII 8.42 ˚A line."
- **Physical Observable**: Hot plasma (>4 MK), X-ray flare arcade below the CME.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "This line emits at temperatures higher than 4 MK, and the Mg XII images contain only the signal from the hot plasma without any low temperature background."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for temporal correlation analysis with impulsive acceleration phase and X-ray lightcurves.

### SphinX Spectrophotometer on board CORONAS-PHOTON

- **General Comments**:
  - Used to measure the full-disk solar X-ray flux in the 1–15 keV energy range, with higher sensitivity than GOES; provided detailed flare evolution and synthetic GOES data for the event.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "SphinX is a spectrophotometer that worked on board the CORONAS-PHOTON satellite. SphinX registered solar spectra in the 1–15 keV energy range. In 2009, the solar cycle was in deep minimum, and the GOES ﬂux usually was below the sensitivity threshold. SphinX is more sensitive than GOES, and we use it to see the variation of the X-ray ﬂux."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare-enhanced X-ray flux and time derivative for reconnection tracking
- **Time Range**: April 23, 2009, ≈06:45 UT – ≈12:00 UT (Spanning first impulsive acceleration and subsequent CME phases)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "During the period of the observations, the GOES X-ray ﬂux was below its sensitivity threshold. From ≈06:45 UT to 11:00 UT, the SphinX registered an increase of the X-ray ﬂux."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1–15 keV, as well as synthetic GOES 1–8 Å bandpass derived from SphinX
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "SphinX registered solar spectra in the 1–15 keV energy range."
    - "We convolved the SphinX spectrum with the response function of the GOES 1–8 ˚A channel and obtained a synthetic GOES ﬂux (see Figure 9, top)."
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk solar X-ray flux, flare impulsive phase, temporal development and derivative used for reconnection analysis (Neupert effect study).
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "Since the Mg XII spectroheliograph observed only one X-ray source, the increase of the SphinX ﬂux comes entirely from the ﬂare arcade."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for both absolute flux and time derivative in acceleration/reconnection comparisons.

### LASCO Coronagraphs (C2 and C3) on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - Used for white-light imaging of the outer corona and CME tracking in fields of view extending above 2 R⊙, capturing CME evolution after its departure from the low corona and observing the CME-CME collision.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "LASCO is a set of white-light coronagraphs that observe solar corona from 1.1 R⊙up to 30 R⊙(C1, 1.1–3 R⊙; C2, 2–6 R⊙; C3, 4–30 R⊙). In 1998, LASCO C1 stopped working, and today LASCO can only image corona above 2 R⊙. We use LASCO data to study the CME evolution above 2 R⊙."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME core, cavity, frontal loop, and CME-CME interaction tracking
- **Time Range**: April 23, 2009, ≈07:38 UT (CME enters C2 FOV) through post-collision and later CME evolution, at least until ≈10:00–11:00 UT
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "By the time the ﬂuxrope had reached the LASCO/C2 ﬁeld of view, the prominence had already drained down to the solar surface."
    - "At the eastern solar limb, another CME occurred before the studied one. In the LASCO/C2 ﬁeld of view, the studied CME collided with the preceding CME at ≈08:50 UT (see Figure 10)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "LASCO is a set of white-light coronagraphs..."
- **Physical Observable**: CME three-part structure (core, cavity, frontal loop); CME height-time trajectory; CME-CME collision and subsequent kinematics.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "In the LASCO/C2 images, the CME had a three-part structure: core, cavity, and frontal loop (see Figure 2f). The CME core in the LASCO images corresponds to the ﬂuxrope center observed in the Fe 171 ˚A images."
    - "We measured the coordinates of the CME core (its central part) and the CME frontal loop (its farthest part) in the TESIS Fe 171 ˚A and He 304 ˚A, LASCO C2 and C3 images..."
- **Additional Comments**: Used in conjunction with TESIS data for continuous tracking through the low and outer corona.

- **General Comments**:
  - Used for imaging in the He 304 Å line to fill temporal data gaps not covered by TESIS 304 Å observations; directly analyzed for prominence and filament evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "During the period of the observations, the TESIS 304 ˚A channel observed the Sun with a 4 min cadence. However, it had data gaps. To ﬁll these data gaps, we used the data of the EIT 304 ˚A telescope. During the period of the observations, the EIT telescope observed the Sun in the 304 ˚A line with a 12 min cadence."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence evolution – supplement to TESIS data

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "Figure 3. Draining of the prominence. These are TESIS and EIT He 304 ˚A images. To increase the prominence’s visibility, we lowered the disk intensity (multiplied by 0.2)."
- **Additional Comments**: Used where TESIS 304 Å observation gaps exist during prominence monitoring.

### STEREO (A and B): EUVI, COR1, and COR2 telescopes

- **General Comments**:
  - STEREO-B EUVI was used for multi-perspective imaging of the prominence (filament) eruption, 3D geometry, flare ribbon tracking, and filament twisting; both STEREO-A and STEREO-B's COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs were used for corroborating CME kinematics at higher altitudes outside the TESIS/LASCO observing geometry.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  - "The STEREO satellites carry EUVI telescopes that image the solar corona in the 171, 195, 284, and 304 ˚A lines. We use the STEREO-B EUVI data to determine the 3D orientation of the erupting prominence and observe the solar surface that is not seen from the Earth point of view.
Moreover, the STEREO satellites carry two white-light coronagraphs: COR1, which images corona at distances of 1.3–4 R⊙, and COR2, which images corona at distances of 2–15 R⊙. We use the COR1 and COR2 data from both satellites to enhance the measurements of the CME kinematics."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament/pre-eruption geometry, ribbon motion, and hot channel observation (EUVI)
- **Time Range**: April 23, 2009, ≈02:51 UT (prominence starts to move) through ≈10:00 UT (ribbon flare and EUVI CME coverage)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "In the STEREO-B EUVI images, the prominence looked like a filament that was inclined by 25◦ to the meridian and was close to the TESIS limb (see Figure 5)."
    - "From 06:46 to 07:20 UT, the flare ribbons appeared below the prominence in all four channels of the STEREO-B EUVI (see Figure 7)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: EUVI: 171 Å, 195 Å, 284 Å, 304 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "The STEREO satellites carry EUVI telescopes that image the solar corona in the 171, 195, 284, and 304 ˚A lines."
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence/filament geometry and eruption, twisting, 2-ribbon flare evolution.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "We use the STEREO-B EUVI data to determine the 3D orientation of the erupting prominence and observe the solar surface that is not seen from the Earth point of view."
    - "During the eruption, a two-ribbon flare occurred below the CME (see Figure 7). The speed of the ribbon separation reflects the reconnection rate in the current sheet (Qiu et al. 2004)."
- **Additional Comments**: Data from both A and B used in CME trajectory and expansion measurements (cross-calibrated to TESIS/LASCO).

#### Data Collection Period 2: CME kinematics at greater heights (COR1/COR2)

    - "Moreover, the STEREO satellites carry two white-light coronagraphs: COR1, which images corona at distances of 1.3–4 R⊙, and COR2, which images corona at distances of 2–15 R⊙. We use the COR1 and COR2 data from both satellites to enhance the measurements of the CME kinematics."
    - "We measured the CME core and frontal loop trajectories in these images using the same method."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "Moreover, the STEREO satellites carry two white-light coronagraphs: COR1, which images corona at distances of 1.3–4 R⊙, and COR2, which images corona at distances of 2–15 R⊙."
- **Physical Observable**: CME front/core position, velocity, and expansion in 3D geometry beyond TESIS/LASCO fields of view.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    - "We want to combine the kinematics measured with TESIS, LASCO, and STEREO... As a result, we obtained a composite kinematics plot consisting of 139 points for the CME core and 61 points for the frontal loop (see Figures 11, 12, and 13, top)."
- **Additional Comments**: Multiple channels cross-registered against LASCO/TESIS for error estimation and composite analysis.
