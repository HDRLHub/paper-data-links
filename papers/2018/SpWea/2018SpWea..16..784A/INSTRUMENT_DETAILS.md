## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the ensemble prediction of a halo coronal mass ejection (CME) using heliospheric imagers (HIs) and complementary in situ observations. The study uses remote-sensing data from white-light coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers onboard spacecraft such as SoHO and STEREO, in addition to in situ measurements from MESSENGER and STEREO-B. Observations span from early stages of the CME in the low corona through its propagation into interplanetary space. Specifically, the paper details the observation times when the CME enters the fields-of-view of different instruments (e.g., LASCO C2/C3, COR2, HI1, HI2) and documents the associated in situ signatures such as shock arrivals and flux rope intervals. Detailed time ranges (using UT and calendar dates) are provided for each observational instrument, and the paper discusses relevant physical observables—including white-light brightness, magnetic field vectors, plasma parameters, and high-energy particle effects—used to constrain the CME’s evolution and improve prediction accuracy.
