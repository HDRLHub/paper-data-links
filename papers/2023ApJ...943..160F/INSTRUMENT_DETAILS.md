# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the identification and statistical analysis of strong coronal magnetic fields in solar cycles 23-24 using high-frequency gyroresonant (GR) emission. The study utilizes over two decades of spatially resolved microwave observations at 17 GHz and 34 GHz from the Nobeyama RadioHeliograph. The research aims to quantify the strongest coronal magnetic fields during these solar cycles, highlighting that active regions with strong magnetic fields, though rare (less than 1% of all active regions), appear regularly on the Sun. These regions are associated with significant solar activities such as flares and eruptions.

## Instrumentation Details

### Nobeyama RadioHeliograph on board Nobeyama Solar Radio Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The Nobeyama RadioHeliograph (NoRH) was pivotal in observing high-frequency microwave emissions from the Sun, crucial for identifying and analyzing regions with strong coronal magnetic fields.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of the Sun at 17 GHz and 34 GHz
- **Time Range**: 1995 – 2018
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A historic record of spatially resolved microwave observations at high frequencies, 17 and 34 GHz, is available from Nobeyama RadioHeliograph for more than 20 years (1995–2018)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17 GHz and 34 GHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Here we employ this data set to identify sources of bright GR emission at 34 GHz and perform a statistical analysis of the identified GR cases to quantify the strongest coronal magnetic fields during two solar cycles."
- **Physical Observable**: Gyroresonant emission from thermal coronal plasma
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Strong coronal magnetic field, when present, manifests itself as bright microwave sources at high frequencies produced by gyroresonant (GR) emission mechanism in thermal coronal plasma."
- **Additional Comments**: The data from NoRH was essential in providing evidence of the existence of coronal magnetic fields exceeding previously expected maximum values, significantly contributing to the understanding of solar magnetic activity and its potential for causing extreme solar events.
