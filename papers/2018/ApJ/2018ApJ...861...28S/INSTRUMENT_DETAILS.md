## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper examines the interplanetary origins of an intense geomagnetic storm in early September 2017 by combining in situ measurements with remote white‐light observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Using data from near‐Earth spacecraft (WIND and DSCOVR) and solar imaging instruments aboard STEREO-A/SECCHI and SOHO/LASCO, the authors trace the evolution, interaction, and shock compression of ICMEs. The study also utilizes high-energy proton flux measurements from WIND/EPA and GOES to investigate the enhancement of solar energetic particles (SEPs) during shock-ICME complex events. Key observation periods range from September 3 to September 11, 2017, with precise time stamps reported for CME onsets, shock arrivals, and ICME passages.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. WIND Spacecraft (Including WIND/EPA)
- **General Comments**:
   - WIND provides in situ solar wind measurements near Earth. It records key plasma and magnetic field parameters such as the magnetic field strength (B), its northward component (Bz), solar wind speed (v), proton density (Np), proton temperature (Tp), and plasma beta (β). In addition, WIND/EPA delivers high-energy proton flux data that are critical for assessing SEP enhancements during shock-ICME events.
