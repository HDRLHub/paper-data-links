## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the constraints imposed by the solar core’s rotation rate on models of magnetic angular momentum (AM) transport in stellar interiors. It compares solar models that include hydrodynamic and magnetic instabilities with helioseismic measurements. In particular, the study contrasts the nearly uniform rotation deduced from pressure (p‑) mode oscillations in the external radiative zone with the possibility of a faster rotating core, as inferred from gravity (g‑) mode rotational splittings. Although the paper is predominantly theoretical and model‐based, it refers to observational helioseismic data (p‑ and g‑modes) that provide key constraints on these models. References to observational campaigns (e.g. Couvidat et al. 2003; García et al. 2007; Fossat et al. 2017) and the increasing duration of GOLF data underscore that the dynamical history of the solar interior is being probed over extended observational periods, even though explicit start and end times are not provided.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Helioseismic p‑Mode Observations (Pressure Mode Measurements)
- **General Comments**:
   - These observations are used to probe the rotation profile of the external solar radiative zone (above about 0.2 R⊙).
   - They underpin the determination of the nearly uniform internal rotation as measured through the solar five-minute oscillations.
   - The data referenced (e.g. from Couvidat et al. 2003, Brown et al. 1989, and others) provide the pressure mode constraints against which the solar models are compared.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “The solar five‐minute oscillations have led to the determination of the rotation proﬁle of the Sun (Kosovichev 1988; Brown et al. 1989; Elsworth et al. 1995; Kosovichev et al. 1997; Couvidat et al. 2003; García et al. 2007).” 
   - “All models correctly reproduce the rotation rates in the external part of the radiative zone (above 0.2 R⊙) as probed by p‑modes (Couvidat et al. 2003).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: General p‑Mode Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “…as probed by p‑modes…” (Couvidat et al. 2003) does not include a specific observational time range.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
      - **Supporting Quote**: There is no detailed mention of specific wavelengths; the observations concern oscillation frequencies in the solar acoustic spectrum.
   - **Physical Observable**: Rotational frequency splittings of pressure modes.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Measurements of rotational splittings of pressure (p‑) modes…” 
   - **Additional Comments**: These observations predominantly constrain the rotation in the solar radiative layer above 0.2 R⊙ and are fundamental in validating the flat rotation profile in this region.

### 2. Helioseismic g‑Mode Observations (Gravity Mode Measurements via GOLF Data)
- **General Comments**:
   - Gravity (g‑) mode measurements are proposed as a way to directly probe the rotation of the solar core.
   - The paper emphasizes that a detection of g‑mode rotational splittings would offer invaluable constraints, particularly on the faster rotation of the inner core (below about 0.2 R⊙).
   - The increasing total duration of data from the GOLF instrument is highlighted, which enhances the possibility of detecting these elusive modes.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “With the increasing total duration of GOLF data, achieving such a detection becomes a real possibility (e.g. Belkacem et al. 2009; Appourchaux et al. 2010; Belkacem 2011).”
   - “…reported detections of g‑modes suggest that the core of the Sun could be rotating more rapidly than the rest of the radiative zone (García et al. 2007, 2011; Fossat et al. 2017).”
- **Data Collection Period 1: G‑Mode Observations**
   - **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided in the paper.
      - **Supporting Quote**: The text only refers to “the increasing total duration of GOLF data” without specifying a start and end date.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Not specified.
      - **Supporting Quote**: The paper does not include details on the wavelength coverage; g‑modes are detected through Doppler velocity measurements rather than through a specified wavelength band.
   - **Physical Observable**: Rotational splittings of gravity modes that probe the solar core’s rotation.
      - **Supporting Quote**: “Measurements of rotational splittings of gravity (g‑) modes would offer invaluable constraints on the rotation of the solar core…”
   - **Additional Comments**: While the robustness of g‑mode detections is still debated, their potential to distinguish between different prescriptions for magnetic angular momentum transport makes them critical. The instrument (GOLF) operates continuously, accumulating data over long periods, although specific observational dates are not mentioned in the paper.
