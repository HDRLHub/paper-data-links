produce the script. We need to construct queries for the EPI-Hi, LET, and SEPT instruments onboard the Parker Solar Probe and STEREO-A respectively, focusing on the specific date of May 29, 2020. Since the instruments are designed to measure particle energies rather than electromagnetic wavelengths, the queries will focus on the time range and the physical observables related to proton fluxes at specified energy levels. We will ensure that the script is clear and well-commented, reflecting the specific data used in the context provided.
