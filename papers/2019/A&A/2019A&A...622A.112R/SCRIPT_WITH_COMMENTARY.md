This script queries the SOHO/MDI instrument data available via the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO).
According to the context, we wish to obtain a snapshot of the SOHO/MDI LOS magnetic field observations 
on 14 April 2010 at around 11:00 UT. 

Note:
- Although the paper also refers to Hinode data and simulation results, only SOHO/MDI data are available 
  in the provided VSO interface.
- We define a one‚Äêminute time interval (from 11:00 UT to 11:01 UT) representing the snapshot.
- The query specifies source, instrument and the observable (LOS_magnetic_field) for clarity.
- The Fido.fetch command is provided but commented out to avoid immediate downloading.
  
Make sure you have SunPy installed (pip install sunpy) and an active internet connection to run the query.
