## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the modeling of an energetic storm particle (ESP) event that occurred on 14 July 2012 using the PARADISE (PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration) model in conjunction with the EUHFORIA (EUropean Heliospheric FORcasting Information Asset) model. The study aims to simulate the interplanetary acceleration and transport of low-energy protons associated with a CME-driven shock as it passed Earth. The models utilized aim to capture the structural features and dynamics of the ESP event, including the effects of the shock's interaction with the solar wind and the resultant particle acceleration. The paper evaluates the performance of these models by comparing the simulation results with in situ observations from spacecraft instruments like ACE/EPAM and SoHO/ERNE, focusing on their ability to replicate observed energetic particle intensities and the timing of the shock and flux rope arrival at Earth.

## Instrumentation Details

### ACE/EPAM on board Advanced Composition Explorer
- **General Comments**:
   - ACE/EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor) is used to measure the intensities of ions and electrons. It plays a crucial role in detecting and analyzing the characteristics of energetic particles, particularly during solar energetic particle (SEP) events and ESP events.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the ESP event on 14 July 2012
- **Time Range**: 14 July 2012
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies measured)
- **Physical Observable**: Ion intensity-time profiles in various energy channels, specifically capturing abrupt intensity rises indicative of the ESP event.
- **Additional Comments**: The data from ACE/EPAM were critical in identifying the onset and evolution of the ESP event, providing key insights into the particle dynamics as the CME-driven shock passed Earth.

### SoHO/ERNE on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
- **General Comments**:
   - The Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument on SoHO is designed to measure the flux of solar energetic particles. It provides data on higher energy particles compared to ACE/EPAM.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Measurement during the ESP event on 14 July 2012
- **Time Range**: 14 July 2012
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (particle energies measured)
- **Physical Observable**: Proton intensities up to about 30 MeV.
- **Additional Comments**: ERNE data complemented observations from ACE/EPAM by extending the energy range of observed particles, thereby enriching the analysis of the ESP event and offering a broader energy spectrum associated with the shock arrival.

### EUHFORIA Modeling Tool
- **General Comments**:
   - EUHFORIA is used for simulating the solar wind and CME propagation through interplanetary space. It provides the background solar wind configuration necessary for modeling particle acceleration and transport in PARADISE.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Simulation of solar wind and CME for the ESP event
- **Time Range**: Simulation covers the period leading up to and including 14 July 2012
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (simulation data)
- **Physical Observable**: Simulated solar wind parameters and CME propagation characteristics.
- **Additional Comments**: The simulation includes parameters like solar wind speed, density, and magnetic field strength, crucial for understanding the conditions under which the ESP event occurred.

### PARADISE Modeling Tool
- **General Comments**:
   - PARADISE computes energetic particle distributions by solving the focused transport equation, using the solar wind conditions generated by EUHFORIA.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Simulation of particle acceleration during the ESP event
- **Time Range**: Simulation specifically focused on the ESP event on 14 July 2012
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (simulation data)
- **Physical Observable**: Simulated particle intensity-time profiles and energy spectra.
- **Additional Comments**: The model aims to replicate observed features of the ESP event, such as particle intensity variations and spectral characteristics, by simulating the interactions of particles with the CME-driven shock.
