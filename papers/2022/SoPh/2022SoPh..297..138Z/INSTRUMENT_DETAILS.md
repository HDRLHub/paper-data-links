## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper reports on multiwavelength observations of a partial filament eruption associated with a C1.2 class flare in NOAA active region 11236 on 13 June 2011. The event was observed by several instruments, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board the behind Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO, and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi spacecraft. The study focuses on the dynamics of the filament, which splits into two parts during the eruption, and the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) and flare-related phenomena.

## Instrumentation Details

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides full-disk EUV images with a cadence of 12 seconds and a spatial resolution of 1.2 arcseconds.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The prominence eruption and C1.2 flare occurred at the eastern limb in the field of FOV of SDO/AIA, which takes full-disk EUV images out to 1.3 R⊙ with a cadence of 12 s and a spatial resolution of 1.2′′."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the prominence eruption
- **Time Range**: 00:50 UT – 01:32 UT on 13 June 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The prominence starts to erupt from AR 11236 at ∼00:50 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 171 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Time-distance diagrams of S1 in AIA 193, 211, 171, and 304 Å are displayed in Figure 3(a2-d2)."
- **Physical Observable**: Prominence eruption dynamics, bifurcation of filament, and CME initiation
   - **Supporting Quote**: "During eruption, most of the materials, i.e., the major part, rises and flows along closed loops, reaching the opposite (northwest) footpoint."

### Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
   - EUVI provides full-disk images with a spatial resolution of 3.2 arcseconds in multiple wavelengths.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The separation angle of STEREO-B with the Earth was ∼92◦. Therefore, the filament in AR 11236 was close to the central meridian in the FOV of Extreme-UltraViolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al., 2004) of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI; Howard et al., 2008) on board STEREO-B."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the filament eruption
- **Time Range**: 00:50 UT – 01:32 UT on 13 June 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The bottom two rows of Figure 2 show the evolution of filament observed by EUVI-B in 304 and 195 Å."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 304 Å, 195 Å
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The bottom two rows of Figure 2 show the evolution of filament observed by EUVI-B in 304 and 195 Å."
- **Physical Observable**: Filament eruption dynamics and bifurcation
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The major part flows along closed loops and terminates at the eastern footpoint, while the runaway part propagates along S2 and shows absorption compared with the background."

### Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO observes CMEs with a field of view extending from 2 to 6 solar radii.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The corresponding narrow CME was observed by the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al., 1995) on board SOHO spacecraft and recorded by the CDAW CME catalogue."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the jet-like CME
- **Time Range**: 01:36 UT – 02:24 UT on 13 June 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 4(a-e) show five running-difference images of LASCO-C2 during 01:36−02:24 UT, in which the leading edges of CME are encircled by magenta ellipses and their heliocentric distances are labeled."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Narrow CMEs usually originate from blowout coronal jets extending to the field of view (FOV) of white-light (WL) coronagraphs."
- **Physical Observable**: CME dynamics and heliocentric distance
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The leading edges of CME are encircled by magenta ellipses and their heliocentric distances are labeled."

### Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi
- **General Comments**:
   - GBM observes hard X-ray light curves in multiple energy bands.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Hard X-ray (HXR) light curves at 5−12 and 12−27 keV were observed by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; Meegan et al., 2009) on board the Fermi spacecraft."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the C1.2 class flare
- **Time Range**: 00:50 UT – 01:15 UT on 13 June 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The flux starts to increase at ∼00:50 UT and reaches the first peak at ∼00:55:30 UT, which is followed by a second peak at ∼00:58:15 UT and a long decay phase until ∼01:15 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 5−12 keV, 12−27 keV
   - **Supporting Quote**: "HXR light curves of the flare at 5−12 keV (green line) and 12−27 keV (magenta line) are depicted in Figure 5(b)."
- **Physical Observable**: Flare dynamics and energy release
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Two major peaks can also be identified in these energy bands. The two peaks (00:52:10 UT and 00:58:10 UT) at 12−27 keV are denoted by two vertical dashed lines."

### S/WAVES on board STEREO-B
- **General Comments**:
   - S/WAVES observes radio bursts associated with solar flares.
- **Supporting Quote**: "A type III radio burst related to the flare was observed by the S/WAVES instrument (Bougeret et al., 2008) on board STEREO-B."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observation of the type III radio burst
- **Time Range**: 00:56 UT – 01:14 UT on 13 June 2011
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A flare-related type III radio burst was detected by S/WAVES on board STEREO-B as shown in Figure 6. The frequency drifted rapidly from ∼10 MHz to ∼1 MHz during 00:56−01:14 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 10 MHz to 1 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The frequency drifted rapidly from ∼10 MHz to ∼1 MHz during 00:56−01:14 UT."
- **Physical Observable**: Radio frequency drift and nonthermal electron beams
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Considering that type III radio bursts are created by plasma emissions of flare-accelerated non-thermal electron beams propagating outward along open field, the type III radio burst around 00:58 UT confirms the existence of open magnetic field."
