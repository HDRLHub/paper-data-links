This script uses SunPy's VSO client to query data from the STEREO-A spacecraft
for the whistler-mode wave observations during a CME event on March 24â€“25, 2017.
The query is based on the context details provided in the paper.
Only the time range and instrument (STEREO-A) are used, as specified.
Note: The Fido.fetch command is provided as a commented-out line.
