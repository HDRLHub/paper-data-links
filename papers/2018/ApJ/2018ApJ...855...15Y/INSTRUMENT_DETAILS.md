# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper conducts a re-analysis of previously published measurements of magnesium to neon (Mg/Ne) and neon to oxygen (Ne/O) element abundance ratios in the quiet Sun's transition region. It critically relies on emission line data originally captured by the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), specifically data gathered between March 1996 and June 1998. The study updates earlier analyses by employing new atomic data and ionization balance calculations, but does not involve new observations. All key quantitative results are derived directly from the original recorded CDS/NIS spectra, with explicit attention to the exact lines and quiet Sun regions used.

## Instrumentation Details

### Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - The CDS/NIS (Normal Incidence Spectrometer) instrument aboard SOHO is the sole observational source directly used for all emission line intensities analyzed in the study. The paper makes explicit use of CDS measurements obtained in the ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet, specifically targeting spectral lines of magnesium, neon, and oxygen ions.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "The emission line intensity measurements of Young (2005a,b) are used, and no new measurements were performed. The quiet Sun was divided into equal spatial areas of network and supergranule cell centers based on the intensity of O v λ629.7 (formed at 0.2 MK) and intensities were measured for 24 datasets between 1996 March and 1998 June."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Quiet Sun observations forming the basis for Mg/Ne and Ne/O abundance determinations
- **Time Range**: March 1996 – June 1998 (prior to the temporary loss of SOHO in mid-1998)
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - "The emission line intensity measurements of Young (2005a,b) are used, and no new measurements were performed. The quiet Sun was divided into equal spatial areas of network and supergranule cell centers based on the intensity of O v λ629.7 (formed at 0.2 MK) and intensities were measured for 24 datasets between 1996 March and 1998 June. This period was prior to the temporary loss of SOHO in 19981, after which the NIS line profiles were significantly distorted, making measurements of weak lines difficult."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
  - Mg lines: 308–379 Å (NIS1 band)
  - Ne and O lines: 513–633 Å (NIS2 band)
    - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The emission lines considered in the present work are all from the NIS: the magnesium lines all lie in the NIS1 waveband (308–379 Å) and the neon and oxygen lines all lie in the NIS2 waveband (513–633 Å). A complete list of the atomic transitions is given in Table 1."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission lines of Mg, Ne, and O ions; spatially resolved (network and supergranule cell centers); observations of quiet-Sun transition region

- **Additional Comments**: 
  - The specific lines from oxygen, neon, and magnesium ions are numerically tabulated and all line emissivities are calculated using up-to-date atomic physics, but the input data for all results are the CDS/NIS spectra from the 24 datasets in the specified date range.
  - Data were separated into average quiet Sun, network, and cell center regions.
