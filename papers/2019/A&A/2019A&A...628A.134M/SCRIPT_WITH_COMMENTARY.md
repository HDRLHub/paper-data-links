This script uses SunPy's VSO interface to query solar data from the Virtual Solar Observatory.
We perform two separate queries based on the context provided:
1. SDO AIA observations of the microflare event on 2011-09-03 (around 14:20â€“14:30 UT).
2. SoHO SUMER observations of the microflare on 2011 November 8 (from 14:52 UT to 18:02 UT).

Note:
- Only instruments available in the provided VSO interface are used.
- The required query parameters from the context are the time range and instrument.
- The Fido.fetch() commands are commented out. You can uncomment them if you wish to download the data.
