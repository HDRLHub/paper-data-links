# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed analysis of the Ground Level Enhancement (GLE) event on 10 September 2017 (GLE 72) using a combined set of ground‐based neutron monitor (NM) data and space‐borne observations. The study derives the spectral and angular characteristics of solar energetic particles (SEPs) during the event by modeling the NM responses with a newly computed yield function and employing optimization methods. Different phases of the event are analyzed – an initial onset phase with a narrow particle pitch angle distribution and a later, more isotropic phase. The analysis is supported by data integration over multiple time intervals and by comparisons with complementary satellite measurements that include soft X‐ray intensity, proton fluxes, CME observations, and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) directions.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Neutron Monitor (NM) Network – Ground-Based Observatories
- **General Comments**:
   - The NM network is utilized to continuously monitor cosmic ray count rates and detect ground-level enhancements. The study uses data from 27 globally distributed NM stations (e.g., DOMC/DOMB, SOPO/SOPB, FSMT, INVK, among others) each characterized by unique cut-off rigidities and altitudes.
   - These detectors measure the secondary particles produced in extensive atmospheric cascades generated by high-energy SEPs.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The GLE onset was observed by several NM stations at about 16:15 UT (e.g. FSMT and INVK with statistically signiﬁcant increase) and the corresponding alert signal was revealed after 17:00 … a statistically signiﬁcant and high enough signal, which allows one to derive the spectral and angular characteristics of SEPs with sufﬁcient preci‐ sion, was observed at 16:30 UT.”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Event Onset Phase
- **Time Range**: 16:15 UT – 17:15 UT on 10 September 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The GLE onset was observed by several NM stations at about 16:15 UT …” and, in the context of spectral analysis, “Time (UT) corresponds to the start of the ﬁve minute interval over which the data are integrated” (see figures where early phase data are integrated beginning at 16:15 UT).
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; the detectors measure secondary particle count rates.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… ground based detectors, e.g. neutron monitors (NMs).”
- **Physical Observable**: Count rate variations (relative increases in percentage) due to secondary particles resulting from high-energy SEP interactions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The strongest NM increases were observed at the DOMC/DOMB (≈10–15 %), SOPO/SOPB (≈5–8 %)...”
- **Additional Comments**: This period corresponds to the early phase of the event when the NM responses were characterized by a narrow pitch angle distribution, indicative of an anisotropic SEP flux.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Late Phase
- **Time Range**: 17:15 UT – 19:15 UT on 10 September 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Fluence of high-energy SEP during GLE 72… the fluence for the late phase is angle integrated from 17:15 to 19:15 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implicit from the methodology; NM detectors record count rates rather than specific wavelengths.)
- **Physical Observable**: Integrated SEP fluence (energy, time, and angle integrated particle flux) showing an increased low-energy component during the later phase.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Accordingly during the late phase of the event the SEP ﬂux increased at low energies.”
- **Additional Comments**: The later phase reveals a broader particle angular distribution as the SEP flux becomes nearly isotropic.

### 2. GOES Satellite Instruments
- **General Comments**:
   - The GOES satellites provide space-borne measurements including proton fluxes and soft X-ray intensities, which are critical for characterizing the timing and energetic properties of the SEP event.
   - The data from GOES complement the NM observations by capturing the electromagnetic and particle aspects of the solar event.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Figure 1: The top panel shows the proton ﬂuxes measured by GOES… and the bottom panel shows the soft X-ray intensity measured by GOES.”
   
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Time Range**: Observations associated with the event indicate key timings such as a flare peak at 16:06 UT and 5-minute integration intervals aligning approximately with 16:15 UT – 19:00 UT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… the event of 10 September 2017… related to a X8.2 solar ﬂare, it peaked at 16:06 UT…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Soft X-ray wavelengths (specific band not detailed) for measuring the solar flare intensity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… the soft X-ray intensity measured by GOES.”
- **Physical Observable**: Proton flux and soft X-ray flux tracking the solar energetic particle event and associated flare.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… gradual solar energetic particle event measured by spacecraft up to proton energies exceeding 700 MeV/n.”
- **Additional Comments**: GOES data help in the correlation with ground-based NM data to validate the timing and evolution of the event.

### 3. SOHO Instruments (LASCO/C2 and ERNE)
- **General Comments**:
   - SOHO provides combined observations with its LASCO/C2 coronagraph and the ERNE particle detector. LASCO/C2 images the outer corona to detect coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while ERNE measures energetic particle composition, notably the Fe/O ratio.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The CME was ﬁrst observed in SOHO / LASCO / C2 ﬁeld of view at 16:00:07 UT.”
   - “The middle panel shows the Fe/O ratio at 50–100 MeV/n measured by SOHO / ERNE.”
   
#### Data Collection Period for LASCO/C2:
- **Time Range**: Observation begins at 16:00:07 UT on 10 September 2017
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The CME was ﬁrst observed in SOHO / LASCO / C2 ﬁeld of view at 16:00:07 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light coronagraph imaging (wavelength details not explicitly provided).
   - **Supporting Quote**: (Implied by “field of view” of LASCO/C2.)
- **Physical Observable**: Observation of the CME’s leading edge and its initial speed, indicative of the shock front’s formation.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The initial speed of the CME was very high, 3620 km s−1, as measured from the leading edge of the structure.”
- **Additional Comments**: This early observation of the CME is critical in linking the coronal shock formation to the subsequent SEP release.

#### Data Collection Period for SOHO/ERNE:
- **Time Range**: Observations during the course of the event (integrated with the NM and GOES time ranges, approximately during the period 16:15 UT – 19:00 UT)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… the middle panel shows the Fe/O ratio at 50–100 MeV/n measured by SOHO / ERNE.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable; instead, ERNE observes particle energy channels.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Fe/O ratio at 50–100 MeV/n” (indicating energy ranges rather than electromagnetic wavelengths).
- **Physical Observable**: The elemental composition (Fe/O ratio) of the SEPs, providing insights into the nature of the event.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… the related SEPs had the Fe/O abundance ratio below 0.1 at 50-100 MeV/n.”
- **Additional Comments**: SOHO/ERNE data support the identification of the event as a gradual SEP event.

### 4. SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
   - The AIA instrument on SDO is used to capture high-resolution images of the solar atmosphere in multiple wavelengths, facilitating the tracing of the CME shock front and its evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**:

- **Physical Observable**: Imaging of the coronal shock front and CME flanks.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “… with the flanks being traced in the atmospheric imaging assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory.”
- **Additional Comments**: SDO/AIA imagery complements the coronagraph data from SOHO/LASCO and serves to provide a detailed view of the shock front propagation in the corona.

### 5. ACE Satellite
- **General Comments**:
   - ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) is employed to measure the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and plasma parameters, which are used to determine the apparent source direction of the SEP flux.
