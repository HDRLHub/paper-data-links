Sure, let's break down the task step by step to create the Python Sunpy VSO query script.

### Reasoning

1. **Understand the Context**:
   - We need to query data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO).
   - The data is divided into two periods: 
     - Training and Validation Set: January 1996 – October 2011
     - Test Set: November 1996 – December 2011
   - The physical observable is the Line-of-Sight (LoS) magnetic field.

2. **Identify the Required Parameters**:
   - **Instrument**: MDI
   - **Time Range**: Two specific ranges as mentioned above.
   - **Physical Observable**: Line-of-Sight (LoS) magnetic field (though this is not directly used in the query, it helps in understanding the context).

3. **Construct the Queries**:
   - We will use the `Fido.search` function from Sunpy to query the data.
   - We will print out the query results and comment out the `Fido.fetch` commands.

### Script

```python
import sunpy.net
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the instrument and time ranges based on the context
instrument = a.Instrument('mdi')
time_range_training_validation = a.Time('1996-01-01', '2011-10-31')
time_range_test = a.Time('1996-11-01', '2011-12-31')

# Query for the training and validation set
print("Querying for Training and Validation Set:")
query_training_validation = Fido.search(time_range_training_validation, instrument)
print(query_training_validation)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# Fido.fetch(query_training_validation)

# Query for the test set
print("Querying for Test Set:")
query_test = Fido.search(time_range_test, instrument)
print(query_test)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# Fido.fetch(query_test)
```

### Explanation

- **Imports**: We import the necessary modules from Sunpy.
- **Define Parameters**: We define the instrument and the two time ranges.
- **Query for Training and Validation Set**: We use `Fido.search` to query the data for the training and validation set and print the results.
- **Query for Test Set**: Similarly, we query the data for the test set and print the results.
- **Fetch Commands**: The `Fido.fetch` commands are commented out as per the directive.

This script is explicit, well-commented, and directly reflects the data used in the context provided.
