## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper discusses the first results from the newly installed CALLISTO spectrometer at the Egypt-Alexandria station, part of the e-CALLISTO network. The spectrometer, equipped with a long-wavelength array antenna, began operations on August 14, 2021, and has been used to monitor solar radio transients. Despite low solar activity, the instrument successfully detected several solar radio bursts, including type II, III, and V. The paper includes a detailed case study of two specific radio burst events: a type II burst associated with an M1.6 solar flare and a CME on October 09, 2021, and a type III burst on August 27, 2021. These events were analyzed to validate the instrument's performance and its integration into global space weather monitoring efforts.

## Instrumentation Details

### CALLISTO Spectrometer on board Egypt-Alexandria Station
- **General Comments**:
   - The CALLISTO spectrometer is designed to monitor solar radio transients and is part of a global network aimed at providing comprehensive data coverage. The instrument's data contributes to space weather monitoring and forecasting, particularly useful in regions with significant data gaps like Africa.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Type II Radio Burst Observation
- **Time Range**: October 09, 2021, 06:30 UT – 07:00 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Fig.3 (a) presents a type II radio dynamic spectrum detected by the instrument between 06:30 UT and 07:00 UT on October 09, 2021."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Starting frequency ~80 MHz, ending frequency ~25 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The fundamental and harmonic components have a starting frequency of ~80 MHz at 06:35 UT and 06:38 UT, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar radio bursts (Type II), associated with solar flares and CMEs
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The type II radio burst observed on October 09, 2021, between 06:30 and 07:00 UT, was associated with an M1.6 solar flare located at N18E08 within NOAA-AR 12882 and a CME with a shock front speed of ~978 km/s."
- **Additional Comments**: The observation included both fundamental and harmonic emissions, and the event was confirmed by other stations within the e-CALLISTO network and external observatories.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Type III Radio Burst Observation
- **Time Range**: August 27, 2021, 10:45 UT – 11:00 UT
   - **Supporting Quote**: "Fig.6 shows a spectrum of a type III radio burst detected by the instrument on August 27, 2021, from 10:45 UT to 11:00 UT."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Starting frequency ~80 MHz, ending frequency ~25 MHz
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The upper and lower frequency cut-offs are ~80 MHz and ~25 MHz, respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar radio bursts (Type III), not associated with CMEs or solar flares
   - **Supporting Quote**: "After vigorous checks from various space weather monitoring and forecasting databases, it was ascertained that the event was neither associated with CME nor solar flare."
- **Additional Comments**: This observation was part of the initial detections following the installation of the CALLISTO spectrometer, highlighting its capability to detect solar radio bursts even during periods of low solar activity.
