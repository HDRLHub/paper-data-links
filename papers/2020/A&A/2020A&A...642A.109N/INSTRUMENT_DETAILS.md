## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the formation times of eruptive hot magnetic flux ropes (HFRs) relative to the onset of solar eruptions. The study utilizes extensive extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, primarily from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), over long (more than eight hours) uninterrupted time intervals. The paper compares the appearance of these HFRs (observed mainly in the 131 Å passband) with the onset of the eruptive flare (as determined by GOES X-ray time profiles) and employs morphological criteria to classify events. Additional instruments such as Hinode’s X-Ray Telescope (XRT), GOES X-ray channels, and the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) are used for cross-checks of flux rope signatures and flare activity. Other referenced instruments such as the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) support past plasma diagnostics.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA is the primary instrument used in this study. It delivers high-cadence, high spatial resolution EUV images in multiple narrowband channels. These observations are used to monitor the evolution and appearance of HFRs in the solar corona.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “We inspected uninterrupted sequences of 131 Å images that spanned more than eight hours and were obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)...”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Long-duration full-disk EUV observations for HFR evolution
- **Time Range**: “an interval of more than eight hours, ending a few minutes after the onset time of the eruption.”
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In each passband, our data covered an interval of more than eight hours, ending a few minutes after the onset time of the eruption.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 94 Å, 131 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 304 Å, and 335 Å.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “We used images obtained in narrowband channels centered at 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335 Å, which have peak responses at about 6.3, 10, 0.6, 1.6, 2.0, 0.05, and 2.5 ×10^6 K, respectively (Lemen et al. 2012).”
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission intensities that trace multi-million Kelvin flare plasma (especially in the 131 Å and 94 Å channels) and cooler coronal material (171, 304 Å) to determine morphological evolution and thermal diagnostics of HFRs.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The emission in the 94 and 131 Å passbands probes multi-million Kelvin plasma only during flares; during quiescent periods, their signal is dominated by emissions from cooler plasmas with temperatures below 10^6 K (O’Dwyer et al. 2010).”
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The original AIA cadence is 12 s with a pixel size of 0.6″ and a field of view of 1.3 R⊙. To reduce data size for this study, the cadence was degraded to two minutes.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The pixel size, cadence, and field of view of the AIA images are 0.6′′, 12 s, and 1.3R⊙, respectively... To reduce data size, the cadence of the AIA data was degraded to two minutes.”

### 2. Hinode X-Ray Telescope (XRT)
- **General Comments**:
   - The XRT serves as a complementary instrument to AIA, providing confirmation of flux rope morphology by imaging in X-rays. Its filters have a broad temperature response, covering plasma conditions from above 2 MK to more than 10 MK.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In Paper I, the identification of HFRs in 131 Å was further confirmed by the identification of flux rope structures in Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) data. The response of all XRT ﬁlters is broad...”
- **Data Collection Details**:
   - The XRT data were not available as long uninterrupted sequences as the AIA data. Only ten of the 34 eruptive events were observed by the XRT.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “However, only ten of the 34 eruptive AIA events were also observed by the XRT, and ﬂux rope morphologies were detected in seven of them. Furthermore, it was diﬃcult to ﬁnd uninterrupted eight-hour-long sequences of XRT data for any of them.”
- **Time Range**: No comprehensive time range; individual sequences are limited and event dependent.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - Wavelength coverage is not explicitly given in terms of specific passbands; instead, XRT uses a set of filters sensitive to broad ranges of temperatures.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...which allows them to probe material at a broad temperature range (from above 2 MK to more than 10 MK for the thin ﬁlters).”

### 3. GOES X-ray Sensors
- **General Comments**:
   - GOES data are used to determine the onset time of the eruptive flares by inspecting the 1-8 Å X-ray flux time profiles. These measurements serve as a reference for comparing with the appearance of the HFRs in the EUV images.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...we used the onset time of the eruptive flare as a reasonable proxy for the onset time of the eruption. Following Cheng et al. (2020), we found the onset time… by inspecting the GOES 1-8 Å ﬂux time proﬁles...”
- **Data Collection Details**:
   - GOES observations provide full-disk X-ray flux data. In 30 out of the 34 events, the GOES flare onset times agreed with the times determined from the AIA data.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “In 30 out of the 34 events, our estimates agreed with the ﬂare onset times provided by the GOES ﬂare list, while in the remaining cases the diﬀerences were less than 5 minutes.”
- **Time Range**: The GOES data are used continuously throughout the events to capture flare evolution; exact time spans are event dependent and synchronized with the AIA observations.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - Wavelength: 1-8 Å (X-ray range).
   - Physical Observable: X-ray flux intensity that marks the start and evolution of eruptive flares.

### 4. Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO is referenced as a complementary instrument for checking the presence or absence of white-light CMEs associated with the observed solar eruptions.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the absence of white-light CMEs in the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) data.”
- **Data Collection Details**:
   - LASCO provides coronagraph images to detect CME signatures. It is used here to infer whether the eruption was confined or associated with a CME.
- **Time Range**: LASCO data continuously monitor the solar corona; however, no specific observational time range is provided in the text.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - Not specified in terms of narrowband wavelengths; LASCO images in white light.
   - Physical Observable: White-light scattering from coronal plasma to identify CMEs.

### 5. Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Hinode EIS is mentioned in the context of previous work that performed differential emission measure analysis on HFR events. It helped in constraining plasma properties such as the electron density.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the value of n = 12 × 10^9 cm^−3 has been taken from Syntelis et al. (2016), who performed differential emission measure analysis of two HFR events observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and AIA…”
- **Data Collection Details**:
   - EIS observations were used in earlier studies for plasma diagnostic purposes and are referenced here to support discussions on cooling timescales.
- **Time Range**: Specific time ranges are not provided for the EIS data in this paper.
- **Wavelength(s) and Physical Observable**:
   - Wavelength details are not elaborated in the text; EIS is known to observe in the EUV range.
   - Physical Observable: Spectroscopic signatures related to plasma temperatures and densities for differential emission measure analysis.
