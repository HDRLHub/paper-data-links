# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a machine‐learning (neural network) model, ORIENT-R, designed to forecast and reconstruct relativistic electron fluxes (>1.8 MeV) in the Earth's outer radiation belt. The model uses only solar wind conditions and geomagnetic indices as inputs and is validated against a range of in situ observations. The primary dataset comes from the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) onboard the twin Van Allen Probes, covering both short-term (geomagnetic storm) and long-term (solar cycle) variations. Additionally, the model’s performance is corroborated using independent electron flux data from the Proton-Electron Telescope (PET) on the SAMPEX satellite, while auxiliary measurements from the MagEIS instrument onboard the Van Allen Probes are mentioned to derive electron phase space density through pitch angle distributions.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) on board the Van Allen Probes (RBSP-A and RBSP-B)
- **General Comments**:
   - The REPT instrument provides spin-averaged energetic electron flux measurements that are crucial for characterizing the dynamics of the outer radiation belt.
   - It is mounted on twin spacecraft (RBSP-A and RBSP-B) that follow a highly elliptical, low-inclination orbit, enabling measurements from ~600 km perigee to an apogee of ~6 Earth radii.
   - It measures electrons in an energy range of approximately 1.5–20 MeV.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "The primary dataset consists of spin-averaged energetic electron flux measurements obtained from the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) instrument (Baker et al., 2012) onboard the Van Allen Probes (RBSP) (Mauk et al., 2012)."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: RBSP-A Measurements
- **Time Range**: September 1, 2012 – October 14, 2019  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "The complete set of the REPT measurements spans from September 1, 2012, to the end of the mission (October 14, 2019 for RBSP-A..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (the instrument detects energetic electrons rather than electromagnetic radiation).
- **Physical Observable**: Relativistic electron fluxes in the energy range ~1.5–20 MeV.
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "...measured in the energy range ~1.5- 20 MeV..."
- **Additional Comments**: Cross-calibration between RBSP-A and RBSP-B ensures that the measurements are consistent to within 1%.

#### Data Collection Period 2: RBSP-B Measurements
- **Time Range**: September 1, 2012 – July 16, 2019  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "...and the end of the mission (… July 16, 2019 for RBSP-B)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Relativistic electron fluxes similar to those measured by RBSP-A.
- **Additional Comments**: Data from both spacecraft are combined to create a unified dataset for the study.

### 2. Proton-Electron Telescope (PET) on board the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX)
- **General Comments**:
   - The PET instrument on SAMPEX is used to measure ~2 MeV electron fluxes in a low Earth orbit environment.
   - Its observations serve as an out-of-sample validation for the ORIENT-R model, providing a complementary perspective to the equatorial measurements made by the Van Allen Probes.
   - SAMPEX operates in a polar, low Earth orbit, capturing electrons with a limited range of equatorial pitch angles close to the loss cone.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "the ~2 MeV electron fluxes measured by the Proton-Electron Telescope (PET) on the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) satellite..."
  
#### Data Collection Period:
- **Time Range**: The PET data referenced for validation are from 2004, with additional comparative data available from 1995 to 2009.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     "Figure 7 compares the electron fluxes measured by the LEO SAMPEX satellite and the equatorial electron fluxes reconstructed by the ORIENT-R model in 2004."  
     "the figures of comparison from 1995 to 2009 are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5519666."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Measures ~2 MeV electron fluxes at low Earth orbit.
- **Additional Comments**: The SAMPEX PET data, being collected in a polar orbit, differ in geometric sampling (observing near the loss cone) compared to the Van Allen Probes. Yet, they show qualitative agreement with the equatorial flux reconstructions, underscoring the robustness of the ORIENT-R model.

### 3. Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) on board the Van Allen Probes
- **General Comments**:
   - The MagEIS instrument provides measurements of electron fluxes with high resolution in pitch angle, allowing for the determination of electron phase space density.
   - It complements REPT measurements by offering detailed information on the pitch angle distribution, which is critical for understanding the adiabatic invariants and dynamics of the radiation belt electrons.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
   "From the Van Allen Probes observation, the electron phase space density data at different adiabatic invariants can be obtained from the pitch angle distribution of electron fluxes over a wide range of energies from both the REPT and MagEIS instruments."
- **Time Range**: Operates concurrently with the REPT instrument, thus its data span the same period as the Van Allen Probes: approximately September 1, 2012 to October 14, 2019 (RBSP-A) and September 1, 2012 to July 16, 2019 (RBSP-B).
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied by the joint usage of REPT and MagEIS measurements.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Electron pitch angle distributions and electron phase space density over a wide energy range.
- **Additional Comments**: Although mentioned briefly in the context of phase space density reconstruction, MagEIS enhances the overall understanding of electron dynamics by providing complementary data to the REPT measurements.
