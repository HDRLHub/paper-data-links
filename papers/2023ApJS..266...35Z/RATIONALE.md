**produce the script**. We need to construct queries that can fetch data from instruments that observe CMEs and measure solar photospheric magnetic fields, as these are crucial for the study described. Given the context, we will focus on instruments like SOHO/LASCO for CME observations and SDO/HMI for solar photospheric magnetic fields. We will also consider the time range around the specific event date mentioned (2011 November 3) for our queries.

### Script:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period around the 2011 November 3 CME event
start_date = '2011-11-01'
end_date = '2011-11-05'

# Time range for the entire observation period
time_range = a.Time(start_date, end_date)

# SOHO/LASCO for CME observations
# LASCO C2 and C3 are typically used for observing the outer corona
lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")
detector_c2 = a.Detector("C2")
detector_c3 = a.Detector("C3")

# SDO/HMI for solar photospheric magnetic fields
hmi_instrument = a.Instrument("HMI")
hmi_observable = a.Physobs("LOS_magnetic_field")

# Construct queries for LASCO C2, C3 and SDO/HMI
lasco_c2_query = Fido.search(time_range, lasco_instrument, detector_c2)
lasco_c3_query = Fido.search(time_range, lasco_instrument, detector_c3)
hmi_query = Fido.search(time_range, hmi_instrument, hmi_observable)

# Display the query results for LASCO C2, C3 and SDO/HMI
print("Query for LASCO C2 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c2_query)
print("Query for LASCO C3 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c3_query)
print("Query for SDO/HMI Photospheric Magnetic Field Data:")
print(hmi_query)

# Uncomment the lines below to download the data
# lasco_c2_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_c2_query)
# lasco_c3_files = Fido.fetch(lasco_c3_query)
# hmi_files = Fido.fetch(hmi_query)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Time Range**: We define a time range around the 2011 November 3 event to ensure we capture relevant data before and after the CME event.
2. **Instruments**:
   - **SOHO/LASCO**: Used for observing CMEs. We specifically query for data from the C2 and C3 detectors, which cover different parts of the corona.
   - **SDO/HMI**: Used for measuring the solar photospheric magnetic fields, which are crucial inputs for the MHD models mentioned in the paper.
3. **Queries**: We construct separate queries for each detector of LASCO and for the HMI instrument.
4. **Results**: The script prints out the results of the queries, which can be used to assess the availability of data for the specified period. The actual data download commands are commented out to prevent accidental execution.

This script aligns with the requirements of the study by focusing on the specific instruments and data types mentioned in the context, ensuring that the queries are tailored to retrieve data relevant to the modeling of SEPs and CMEs as described.
