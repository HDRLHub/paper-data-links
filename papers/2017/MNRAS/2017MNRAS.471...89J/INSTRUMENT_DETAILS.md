## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This study investigates the energetic and spectral characteristics of nonthermal electrons produced during small acceleration episodes in the solar corona. The research relies on a comprehensive survey of in-situ electron measurements at 1 AU over the span of 2004–2015, focusing on impulsive electron events unassociated with large solar flares (GOES class > C1) or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The paper uses direct data from the ACE/EPAM instrument to identify electron spikes, RHESSI observations to detect faint but observable hard X-ray emission near the west solar limb, and WIND/WAVES radio spectrograms to confirm interplanetary type III radio bursts contemporaneous with the events. Only events fulfilling all three observational criteria—direct in-situ electron detection, coincident HXR emission, and associated type III bursts—form the six-event final shortlist subjected to detailed quantitative analysis. Data collection periods, energy/wavelength ranges, and observation details are explicitly stated for each instrument, and these observations underpin the entirety of the event selection, analysis, and resulting conclusions.

## Instrumentation Details

### ACE/EPAM (Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor) on board ACE spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - ACE/EPAM data provide the primary in-situ measurement of nonthermal electrons at 1 AU in four distinct energy channels, which are directly analyzed to characterize the escaping electron populations. Data from 2004–2015 are used for event identification and quantitative spectral analysis.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Our primary focus is on small impulsive electron events observed in-situ at 1 AU by the EPAM detector aboard the ACE spacecraft. We carried out an extensive survey using ACE/EPAM data spanning the years 2004–2015, which covered the maxima of solar cycles 23 and 24 and the intervening minimum." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Survey and event characterization
- **Time Range**: 2004–2015, with individual events analyzed for precise subintervals (e.g., "Feb 28,2004 03.24 UT", "Mar 16,2004 08.56 UT", etc.)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We carried out an extensive survey using ACE/EPAM data spanning the years 2004–2015, which covered the maxima of solar cycles 23 and 24 and the intervening minimum."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Electron energy channels DE1 (38–54 keV), DE2 (53–103 keV), DE3 (103–173 keV), and DE4 (175–315 keV)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The magnetically deflected electron detector, LEMS30 has four energy channels from 38-315 keV. These channels are named DE1(38-54 keV), DE2(53-103), DE3(103-173 keV) and DE4(175-315 keV)."
- **Physical Observable**: In-situ electron flux at multiple energies; used for spectral, timing, and flux analysis of escaping nonthermal electrons.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Electrons arriving at 1 AU are recorded in four energy channels between 38 and 315 keV by ACE/EPAM. We use ACE/EPAM 12 second data (Gold et al. 1998). The peak mean energies of the four channels, DE1-4 are 45,74,134 and 235 keV respectively."

- **Additional Comments**: 
  - Data are used to create differential energy spectra, identify impulsive spikes, and determine the number, energy, and power of escaping electrons for each individual event.

### RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager)
- **General Comments**:
  - RHESSI observations are analyzed for the presence of faint hard X-ray emission near the west solar limb, which confirms downward-precipitating electrons and allows for spectral fitting to derive nonthermal electron parameters. Data are also used for imaging and timing of HXR peaks.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We further require that the events we analyze have enough HXR photon counts for carrying out spectroscopic and imaging anaylsis using RHESSI data. We require that the the RHESSI signatures are located near the west limb, which would enable better magnetic connectivity to the Earth for escaping electrons (Figure 4 and Table 2)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Event-associated hard X-ray detection
- **Time Range**: Exact intervals correspond to HXR emission peaks for each event (e.g., Feb 28, 2004 03.24 UT, Mar 16, 2004 08:56 UT, etc.).
  - **Supporting Quote**: Table 2 lists for each event: "Date     RHESSI Peak   Flare Position    γ    δ1AU   δhxr" with entries such as "Feb 28,2004        03.24          697, 301 ..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 12–25 keV (peak detection), with additional analysis in RHESSI channels 3–6 keV, 6–12 keV, 25–50 keV
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The event onset at the Sun (tsun) is taken to correspond to the peak of the HXR flux in the RHESSI 12-25 keV channel."
- **Physical Observable**: Hard X-ray photon counts and spectra; used for imaging, timing peak emission, and quantifying the precipitating electron population.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The RHESSI HXR photon spectrum for each event was analysed using SSW/OSPEX. The assumed HXR photon spectrum consists of a thermal core and a long non-thermal tail. The event duration in the lowest available energy channel (which has a reasonable number of counts) was used as integration time for computing the spectra."

- **Additional Comments**:
  - Imaging employs Pixon algorithm for spatial localization; spectral fitting distinguishes thermal vs nonthermal components; duration and timing data set the Sun-release time for propagation analysis.

### WIND/WAVES (RAD1 and RAD2 Receivers) on board WIND spacecraft
- **General Comments**:
  - Dynamic radio spectra from WIND/WAVES are directly analyzed for signatures of associated interplanetary type III radio bursts in precise frequency ranges and timeframes coincident with electron and HXR events. 
- **Supporting Quote**: "We use data from the WAVES RAD1 (20 - 1040 kHz) and RAD2 (1.075 - 13.825 MHz) detectors aboard the WIND spacecraft to search for interplanetary type III bursts associated with the impulsive electron events detected by ACE/EPAM."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Type III radio burst association
- **Time Range**: Onset times per event, within a minute of HXR event Sun time (e.g., Feb 28, 2004 03.25 UT, Mar 16, 2004 08.57 UT, etc.)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We find that all the events have an associated IP type III burst with onset times within a minute of the onset at the Sun tsun. This indicates that electron injection into the interplanetary space happened during the flaring process and any delay at ACE/EPAM is purely due to propagation effects."
- **Wavelength(s)**: RAD1 (20–1040 kHz), RAD2 (1.075–13.825 MHz)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We use data from the WAVES RAD1 (20 - 1040 kHz) and RAD2 (1.075 - 13.825 MHz) detectors aboard the WIND spacecraft..."
- **Physical Observable**: Dynamic radio spectra; interplanetary type III bursts indicating electron beams escaping into the heliosphere.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The low frequency radio dynamic spectrum recorded by WIND/WAVES is depicted in the third panel; it shows interplanetary type III bursts due to the electrons escaping from the coronal acceleration site."

- **Additional Comments**:
  - Type III burst onset times are used for event confirmation and to establish the timing relationship between solar acceleration, escaping electrons, and interplanetary signatures.

### GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) X-ray Sensors
- **General Comments**:
  - GOES soft X-ray data are used for shortlisting by screening out events with large flares and confirming the lack of significant soft X-ray emission (no >C1 class) near the time of each electron/HXR event.
- **Supporting Quote**: "We also make sure that there are no GOES soft X-ray flares larger than the C1 class within 5 minutes of the event onset time tsun. This shortlisting procedure yields a database of 18 events from 2004 to 2015, the details of which are summarized in Table 1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Flare association screening
- **Time Range**: 2004–2015, screening over the entire data interval, with exact timing matched to each electron event.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We also make sure that there are no GOES soft X-ray flares larger than the C1 class within 5 minutes of the event onset time tsun."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 1.5–12 keV, 3–24 keV (as indicated by the labelled channels)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The second panel shows the GOES SXR flux. There is a small enhancement of the GOES soft Xray flux for each event, although the level is < C1."
- **Physical Observable**: Solar soft X-ray flux; used to exclude events with significant soft X-ray emission and confirm coronal, non-flaring origins.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The lack of chromospheric acitivity suggests a coronal origin for these events, as does the steepness of the energy spectra e.g., (Potter et al. 1980)."

- **Additional Comments**: 
  - GOES data are not used for quantitative energy analysis but are integral to the event selection process to ensure purity of the sample.
