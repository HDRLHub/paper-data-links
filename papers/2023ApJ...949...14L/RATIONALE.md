construct the script for querying solar wind data from the Wind and ACE spacecraft during the specified period. We need to focus on the specific time range provided and the physical observables mentioned in the context. Since the context does not specify wavelengths (as these are not applicable to the type of data we are dealing with), we will not include wavelength attributes in our queries. Instead, we will concentrate on the instruments and the type of physical data they collect, such as magnetic fields and ionic composition.
