# Context:
# The paper investigates the frequency stability of solar oscillations above the acoustic cut-off frequency, known as pseudomodes, and their variation with solar activity. The study utilizes data from three instruments: VIRGO, GOLF, and GONG. The data spans over two solar cycles (1996–2021), and the analysis focuses on two frequency ranges: 5600–6800 µHz and 5600–7800 µHz.

# Reasoning:
# We need to construct queries to download data from the three instruments: VIRGO, GOLF, and GONG.
# The time ranges and instruments are specified in the context.
# We will query the data for the specified time ranges and instruments.

# Query for VIRGO data
virgo_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('1996-04-01', '2014-03-30'),
    a.Instrument('VIRGO'),
    a.Wavelength(402 * u.nm) | a.Wavelength(500 * u.nm) | a.Wavelength(862 * u.nm)
)
print("VIRGO Query Results:")
print(virgo_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# virgo_download = Fido.fetch(virgo_query)

# Query for GOLF data
golf_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('1996-04-11', '2018-04-10'),
    a.Instrument('GOLF')
)
print("GOLF Query Results:")
print(golf_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# golf_download = Fido.fetch(golf_query)

# Query for GONG data
gong_query = Fido.search(
    a.Time('2001-06-16', '2021-05-15'),
    a.Instrument('GONG')
)
print("GONG Query Results:")
print(gong_query)
# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# gong_download = Fido.fetch(gong_query)
```
