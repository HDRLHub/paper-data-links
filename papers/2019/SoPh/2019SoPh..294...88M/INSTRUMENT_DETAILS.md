## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates abrupt “termination” events in solar activity cycles and examines how the sudden switching from low- to mid‐latitude activity, commonly observed as enhanced EUV Bright Point (BP) densities and shifts in other solar proxies, constrains our understanding of the solar interior. The study combines nearly 140 years of observations—from sunspot records and Hα filament data to multi-wavelength EUV images and proxy measurements—to track the migration and cancellation of magnetic flux bands over decades. Key observational datasets include space‐based instruments (SOHO/EIT, SDO/AIA, STEREO/EUVI, SDO/EVE) capturing EUV emissions at specific wavelengths during well‐defined periods that bracket the termination events (e.g., 1997 for the Solar Cycle 22/23 minimum and 2011 for the Solar Cycle 23/24 minimum), as well as ground‐based filament observations (Arcetri, Meudon, Kislovodsk) covering historical periods. Complementary Sun-as-a-star proxy indices (NOAA GOES x-rays, the 10.7 cm radio flux, and the Bremen Mg ii index) further support the timing and nature of these rapid transitions.
