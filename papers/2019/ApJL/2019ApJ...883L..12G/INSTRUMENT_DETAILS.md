## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates how Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) influence the Martian surface radiation environment, with a particular focus on establishing a “pivot energy” at ∼300 MeV. The study compares measured and modeled dose rates on Mars, using both in-situ surface measurements and sophisticated particle transport simulations. Key elements include the use of radiation data from the Mars Science Laboratory’s (MSL) rover Curiosity and SEP event data measured near Earth by SOHO. The paper also discusses future opportunities to enhance forecasting with data from missions such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on board Mars Science Laboratory (MSL/Curiosity)
- **General Comments**:
  - RAD is the instrument deployed on the Curiosity rover that has been continuously measuring the Martian surface radiation environment. Its data are used to validate the particle transport model calculations and to study SEP-induced radiation dose rates.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity landed on Mars on August 6, 2012 (Grotzinger et al. 2012). Since then, its Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD, Hassler et al. 2012) has been measuring the Mars surface radiation environment…” 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Ongoing Surface Radiation Measurements Since Landing
- **Time Range**: August 6, 2012 – Present (as implied by “since then” following the landing date)
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “...its Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD, Hassler et al. 2012) has been measuring the Mars surface radiation environment…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable – RAD measures charged particle energies (protons in the 100–800 MeV range and beyond) rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “SEP-induced Martian surface dose rate resulting from primary 100-800 MeV protons…” (implying the energy range of detected particles)
- **Physical Observable**: Martian surface radiation dose rate (measured in mGy/hr) and dose equivalent rate (measured in mSv/hr).
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “...the surface dose rate resulting from 100-800 MeV primary protons is about 93% of that induced by the full SEP spectra…” and “…the surface dose equivalent rate [mSv/hour]…”

- **Additional Comments**:
  - RAD has detected six SEP events to date. Notably, the September 10, 2017 SEP event is highlighted as the most intense and as the first solar event to cause ground-level enhancements on both Earth and Mars.

### 2. In-Situ SEP Detectors on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
  - The paper utilizes a catalog of more than 30 significant SEP events detected in situ at Earth by instruments aboard SOHO over a span of 20 years. These events are used to derive SEP spectra in the energy range from 100 MeV to 800 MeV.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “...a list of more than 30 signiﬁcant SEP events detected in situ at Earth by SOHO in 20 years (K̈uhl et al. 2017), each event spectrum from 100 to 800 MeV was derived in a 2hr interval starting 30 minutes after the event onset (in an energy channel covering 100 MeV to 1 GeV)...”

#### Data Collection Period 1: SEP Event Spectral Measurements
- **Time Range**: Individual SEP event spectra are derived over a 2-hour interval starting 30 minutes after the event onset; overall, the collection spans 20 years.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “...each event spectrum from 100 to 800 MeV was derived in a 2hr interval starting 30 minutes after the event onset…”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable – these instruments measure particle energy channels, specifically in the range of 100 MeV to 1 GeV.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “...in an energy channel covering 100 MeV to 1 GeV.”
- **Physical Observable**: Differential energy spectra of SEPs (e.g., flux measured in particles/sec/cm²/sr/MeV) used to model the induced Martian surface dose rate.
  - **Supporting Quote**: 
    - “...the SEP spectral intensity at 500 MeV versus spectral index γ…” and “...the correlation between the SEP flux at 300 MeV and the Martian surface dose rate…”

- **Additional Comments**:
  - The measurements from SOHO are used to “re-generate” spectra for parametric studies. These data are critical in establishing the correlation whereby the SEP flux at 300 MeV serves as a pivot for determining the surface radiation environment.

### 3. Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
- **General Comments**:
  - Parker Solar Probe is mentioned as a future source of detailed information on solar eruptions and particle propagation, which can enhance data-driven SEP injection and interplanetary transport models for predicting SEP flux at Mars.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...in light of much more detailed information on solar eruptions and particle propagations provided by Parker Solar Probe (Fox et al. 2016) and Solar Orbiter (Mueller et al. 2013) in the near future…”
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly stated in the paper; its data is anticipated to provide near-future enhancements in SEP forecasting.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Detailed measurements related to solar eruptions and SEP propagation characteristics.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - While Parker Solar Probe is referenced for its potential to improve forecasting, it is not directly used in the current analysis.

### 4. Solar Orbiter
- **General Comments**:
  - Solar Orbiter is also referenced as a forthcoming source of high-fidelity data on solar eruptions and particle transport, supporting improved predictive models for SEP events.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - “...more detailed information on solar eruptions and particle propagations provided by Parker Solar Probe (Fox et al. 2016) and Solar Orbiter (Mueller et al. 2013) in the near future…”
- **Time Range**: Not explicitly provided; its role is prospective, aimed at near-future missions and improved forecasting capabilities.
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable.
- **Physical Observable**: Measurements pertinent to the acceleration and injection profiles of particles at the Sun, aiding in modeling SEP flux reaching Mars.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Solar Orbiter is mentioned only to illustrate future opportunities for enhanced data inputs and is not directly involved in the current SEP or Martian radiation measurements.
