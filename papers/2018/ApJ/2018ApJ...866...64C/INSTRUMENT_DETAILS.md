## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents detailed observations of a super-hot current sheet formed during a SOL2017-09-10T X8.2-class solar flare. Using multi-wavelength imaging, spectroscopy, and white‐light coronagraphy, the study reveals the fragmented and turbulent nature of magnetic reconnection. The work utilizes EUV and X‑ray images to track filament activation, bubble eruption, and the evolution of the current sheet, while time–distance plots and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analyses uncover intermittent outflow jets with power‐law spatial and temporal distributions. Observations from multiple instruments across different wavelengths and time ranges (spanning from before 15:35 UT until well after the flare peak, e.g., 16:15 UT and later up to 18:10 UT, with additional white‐light images around 17:12–17:15 UT) are used to capture the dynamic evolution and properties (such as temperature, density, non‑thermal velocities, and turbulence) of the reconnection region.

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA images the solar corona in 7 EUV passbands with a spatial resolution of 0.6 arcsec per pixel and a high cadence (normally 12 seconds, with data used here at a cadence of 24 seconds to ensure a normal exposure time). It provides multi-temperature observations (from ~0.4 MK up to ~20 MK) that are critical for identifying features such as the erupting bubble, current sheet, reconnection inflows, and outflow jets.
