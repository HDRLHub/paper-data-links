# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## 1. GOES-16/SUVI on board GOES-16
- **General Comments**:
  - SUVI images the solar corona in several Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) passbands. It provides a large field‑of‑view (FOV) (out to >1.6 solar radii horizontally and up to 2.3 Rs in the unvignetted corners) with a cadence high enough (mean ~1 minute in the 195 Å channel) to capture rapid CME evolution and EUV wave dynamics. The instrument’s design includes an anti‑blooming circuitry that allows simultaneous imaging of both bright flare regions and faint coronal structures.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - “The SUVI instrument on board of the GOES-16 spacecraft images the solar corona in six EUV passbands, centered at 94, 131, 171, 195, 284, and 304 ˚A, with a large FOV … with a mean cadence of 1 min …”
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Overall Event Coverage
- **Time Range**: 15:20:24 UT – 17:00:24 UT (as indicated by the animated figure online showing the event evolution)
  - **Supporting Quote**: “The animated ﬁgure online shows the event evolution from 15:20:24 to 17:00:24 UT.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple EUV passbands (e.g., 94, 131, 171, 195, 284, and 304 Å); however, the 195 Å channel is predominantly used for CME shell and EUV wave analyses.

- **Wavelength(s)**: White‑light (broadband visible light, due to Thomson scattering of photospheric light by coronal electrons).
- **Physical Observable**: The white‑light CME front, core (associated with the erupting flux rope/cavity), and shock structures such as the observed “bulge” in the CME front.
  - **Supporting Quote**: “… the outer front of the expanding and piled‑up loops observed in the EUV images seamlessly matches with the CME front observed in white‑light coronagraph data.”
