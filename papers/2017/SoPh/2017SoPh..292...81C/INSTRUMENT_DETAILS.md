## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a "two–step" eruption of a solar filament located in NOAA AR 12297 during 14–15 March 2015. The study focuses on the filament’s partial activation and sustained quasi-equilibrium phase on 14 March, followed by a full eruption on 15 March 2015 associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME). Research objectives include analyzing the filament’s dynamic evolution, associated jet activity, calculation of the decay index from photospheric magnetograms, and the characterization of the resulting CME. The principal data sources are direct imaging and magnetic field data obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) in multiple UV/EUV wavelengths and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI), coronagraph observations from SOHO/LASCO, as well as Hα filtergram data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the ground-based Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory. Observational periods span the dual-peak eruption event, specifically covering the interval from at least 14 March 2015 11:00 UT through 15 March 2015 post-eruption, with relevant analysis windows described in detail for each instrument.

  - "The event was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al., 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell, Thomp- son, and Chamberlin, 2012) in diﬀerent UV and EUV wavelengths. The pixel size and cadence of the data is 0.6 arcsec and 12 s respectively."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament activation and partial eruption phase
- **Time Range**: 2015-03-14 11:00 UT – 2015-03-14 13:00 UT (context: start of filament activation and first disturbance)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ﬁlament on 14 March 2015 in AIA 193 ˚A (ﬁrst column), 304 ˚A (second column)...Around 11:50 UT a jet activity started in the active region, which we name as jet 1...Afterwards a strand of the ﬁlament separated from the main body, rose upwards and became stable at the projected altitude ≈125 Mm."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å, 304 Å, also referenced UV/EUV
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ﬁlament on 14 March 2015 in AIA 193 ˚A (ﬁrst column), 304 ˚A (second column)...This jet activity was visible in almost all EUV/UV and Hα wavelengths."
- **Physical Observable**: Filament structure, eruption dynamics, jets, sigmoidal shape, brightening and associated activity
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Before any activity in the ﬁlament it has a long sigmoidal shape...this jet activity the left lower part of the sigmoidal ﬁlament was disturbed. Afterwards a strand of the ﬁlament separated from the main body, rose upwards and became stable at the projected altitude ≈125 Mm."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for detailed multi-channel morphological analysis and context for eruption triggers.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Quasi-equilibrium phase and full eruption
- **Time Range**: 2015-03-14 13:00 UT – 2015-03-15 00:45 UT (context: filament F1 stable then leading into the second eruption)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "An interesting point is that the uplifted broken part F1 from the main sig- moidal ﬁlament was stable in that particular location for a period of ≈12 hrs i.e up to 00:45 UT on 15 March 2015."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å, 304 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The left, middle and right column of Figure 2 show the development of the erupting ﬁlament F1 in AIA 193 ˚A, 304 ˚A, and Hα wavelengths respectively."
- **Physical Observable**: Quasi-equilibrium and final eruption; ribbon separation during flare events, field-aligned motions in the flux rope, twist analysis
  - **Supporting Quote**: "After 00:45 UT the ﬁlament F1 starts to erupt and ﬁnally it leaves the solar surface...The major upper part of the sigmoidal ﬁlament channel (indicated by black arrows in Figure 2) is also perturbed during the ejection of jet 2. The material of the ﬁlament rises up and later on it comes back down to the footpoints of the ﬁlaments. In AIA channels it becomes brighter and we can also see its twisted structure."
- **Additional Comments**: Movies from the AIA 193 Å channel supplement visual tracking of filament and jet features.

The position of the slit is shown by the dashed black line in Figure 3a. The time-distance diagram is given in Figure 3b."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "we select a slit along the direction of the ﬁlament eruption in the AIA 193 ˚A data."
- **Physical Observable**: Height-time analysis, eruption speed, dynamics between two eruption phases
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In the time-distance diagram, we can clearly see the two step eruption of the ﬁlament. In the ﬁrst step, the ﬁlament starts to rise at ≈12:00 UT on 14 March 2015 and shifts to a projected altitude of 125 Mm on the disk....In the second step after 00:45 UT on 15 March 2015, the ﬁlament starts to rise and ﬁnally fully erupts."

The Doppler shift in the moving material can move its Hα line out of the ﬁlter passband (dynamic disappearance), and the heating of the ﬁlament can suppress the absorption of Hα radiation (thermal disappearance)."

All of the ﬁlament body is located between this line and the red line at the height of 6 Mm. The southern ﬁlament does not so strictly follow any PIL, however, its spine is most likely a little bit above the PIL at the height of 78 Mm."
- **Additional Comments**: Snapshots are used as a reference for co-registration with magnetogram and extrapolated field models.
