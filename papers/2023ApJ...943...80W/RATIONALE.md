produce the script. We need to construct a Python script using the SunPy library to query the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for the period from 2010 to 2015. This data will help us analyze the vector magnetograms to study the magnetic properties at the footprints of erupting magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) as described in the context.

Given the context, we know:
- **Instrument**: HMI on SDO
- **Time Range**: 2010 to 2015
- **Physical Observable**: Vector magnetic fields (likely corresponding to "vector_magnetic_field" in the VSO interface)
- **Wavelength**: Not specified, but based on the VSO interface, HMI operates around 6173.0 - 6174.0 Ã….

We will focus on querying this specific data using the attributes provided by the VSO interface. The script will be structured to clearly define the parameters, perform the query, and print the results. The actual data fetching will be commented out to align with the directive.
