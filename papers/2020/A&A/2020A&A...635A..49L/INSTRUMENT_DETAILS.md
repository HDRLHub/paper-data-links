## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies two small solar wind transients observed as unusually low density regions embedded in compressed slow wind within a corotating interaction region (CIR). Multi‐spacecraft in situ data from STEREO B, Wind, ACE, and (to a lesser extent) STEREO A are employed to characterize plasma properties such as proton density, proton temperature, ion composition and charge state ratios, alpha-to-proton number density ratios, and magnetic field configurations. Data from these spacecraft, recorded at specific time intervals during April 2007 (Event One) and June 2011 (Event Two), are combined with remote-sensing imaging from solar EUV instruments (SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA) to trace the solar wind’s origin to small low-latitude coronal holes.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. STEREO B Instrument Suite (PLASTIC, IMPACT: MAG and SWEA)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO B, one of the twin spacecraft launched in late 2006 and orbiting near 1 AU, is equipped with identical instruments as STEREO A. The measurements used here come from the Plasma and Suprathermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument, which provides 1 min averaged solar wind properties (from one-dimensional Maxwellian fits), and from the In situ Measurements of Particles And CME Transients (IMPACT) suite. Within IMPACT, two instruments are used: the Magnetometer (MAG) for magnetic field measurements and the Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA) for suprathermal electron observations.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The two spacecraft are equipped with identical instruments. The data we used are obtained from the Plasma and Suprathermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) (Galvin et al. 2008) and the In situ Measurements of Particles And CME Transients (IMPACT; Luhmann et al. 2008) investigations. The former provides the 1 min average properties of the solar wind... we used data from only two of them, namely the Magnetometer (MAG; Acuña et al. 2008) and Solar Wind Electron Analyzer (SWEA; Sauvaud et al. 2008) instruments."

### 2. Wind Instrumentation (3DP, MFI, and SWE)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wind spacecraft, now orbiting near the L1 Lagrange point, uses two primary in situ instruments. The 3D Plasma and Energetic Particles Experiment (3DP) provides measurements of electrons, protons, and alpha particles with a three-second resolution, while the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) delivers magnetic field data. In addition, for comparison purposes, data from the SWE instrument (which measures both hydrogen and helium) are overplotted.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Wind solar wind plasma data, including electrons, proton, and alpha particles, are obtained from two instruments: the plasma and suprathermal electron data from the 3D Plasma and Energetic Particles Experiment (3DP) (Lin et al. 1995) and the magnetic field data from the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) (Lepping et al. 1995). ... the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) measurements are also used for comparison."

### 4. STEREO A Instrumentation (PLASTIC, IMPACT: MAG and SWEA)
- **General Comments**:
   - STEREO A, the twin to STEREO B, carries the same in situ instrument suite (PLASTIC and IMPACT including MAG and SWEA) and is used to observe the stream interface, although for Event One it did not detect the low density region.

### 5. Solar EUV Imaging Instruments (SOHO/EIT and SDO/AIA)
- **General Comments**:
   - For the purpose of back-mapping the solar wind transients to their source region, the study uses EUV images. The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provided spectroscopic images that help trace the footpoints of the solar transient to small coronal holes near an active region.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Figures 10a and b present the spectroscopic plot based on the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudinière et al. 1995) on board the SOHO and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)... the AIA image for event Two instead [of] EIT is because it has better temporal and spatial resolution."

   - **Wavelength(s)**: 284 Å  
      - **Supporting Quote**: "Footpoint of event One observed by ACE traced back on the spectroscopic image taken by EIT 284 Å, SOHO."
   - **Time Range**: The paper does not specify an exact time range for the EIT observation.
   - **Physical Observable**: Extreme ultraviolet emissions are used to identify coronal hole boundaries and active region details.
