produce the script. We need to query solar observation data from two specific instruments: the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on SOHO and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on SDO. The context provided specifies the need for line-of-sight magnetograms from these instruments, which are crucial for analyzing magnetic fields in solar active regions. Given the time ranges and the specific wavelengths mentioned, we will construct queries to fetch this data.
