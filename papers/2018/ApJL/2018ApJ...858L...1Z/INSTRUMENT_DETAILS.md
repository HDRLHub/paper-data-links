## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper analyzes a solar eruption event that occurred on 2017 June 1 in NOAA AR 12661, consisting of a filament eruption, a CME, a C6.6 flare, and a type II radio burst. The primary research objective is to document and interpret the formation of upward secondary waves (SWs) in a streamer-like solar structure following the propagation of an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave. The study employs multi-instrument observations, including high-cadence, high-resolution EUV imaging from SDO/AIA, ground-based Hα images from GONG, white-light coronagraph data from SOHO/LASCO, and metric radio dynamic spectra from YNAO and Learmonth. Data from these instruments, spanning the hours surrounding the eruption (notably from 01:30 to 02:38 UT on 2017-06-01), are directly processed and analyzed through running-difference, base-ratio, and time-space plot methods to extract kinematics and physical characteristics of the eruption and associated waves, forming the basis of the paper’s findings.
