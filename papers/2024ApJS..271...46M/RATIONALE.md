produce the script. We need to construct queries for the MDI and GONG instruments for the specified time ranges and physical observables. Given the context, we are focusing on solar magnetic fields, which are typically observed at the 6768 Ã… wavelength for both MDI and GONG. We will use the `LOS_magnetic_field` physical observable attribute for our queries. The time ranges are specific for each instrument and need to be defined accurately to match the study's requirements.
