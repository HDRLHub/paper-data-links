## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a new method for modeling the global magnetic field in the solar corona by incorporating a solar wind outﬂow into a magneto-frictional (MF) equilibrium framework. The approach extends the widely used Potential Field Source-Surface (PFSS) model by including outward-flowing plasma effects, which better match both observed streamer shapes and in situ magnetic field measurements. The model is applied using observed lower boundary magnetogram data and compared with in situ magnetic field records over Solar Cycle 24. Key observational inputs include full-disk magnetograms from a space-based instrument and heliospheric magnetic field measurements from an OMNI data compilation, with the magnetograms used to prescribe the radial photospheric magnetic field and the in situ data offering a measure of the open magnetic flux in the upper corona and heliosphere.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - The HMI instrument is used to provide full-disk, line-of-sight magnetogram data of the solar photosphere. In this paper the radial component, “pole‐filled” maps from the HMI synoptic series (hmi.synoptic mr polfil 720s) are employed as the lower boundary condition for the coronal magnetic field modeling. The data are essential for constructing the potential and outﬂow magnetic field solutions.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - "All of the examples in this paper use lower boundary data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument (HMI, Schou et al. 2012). We use the radial component, pole‐filled maps in the hmi.synoptic mr polfil 720s series ..." 

#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Cycle 24 Magnetogram Observations
- **Time Range**: 
   - The magnetogram data span Solar Cycle 24. Specific Carrington Rotations cited include rotations 2130, 2165, and 2222 – which correspond to periods within Solar Cycle 24 (roughly 2008–2019).
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "We show the model applied to data from Solar Cycle 24" and later references to "Carrington Rotation 2165" and "Carrington Rotation 2222" indicate the utilization of HMI data over these rotations.
- **Wavelength(s)**: 
   - The HMI instrument observes the Fe I 6173 Å spectral line.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - While the paper does not explicitly restate the wavelength, it cites Schou et al. (2012) where the HMI characteristics, including the use of the Fe I 6173 Å line, are documented.
- **Physical Observable**: 
   - The instrument measures the photospheric magnetic field via line-of-sight (radial) magnetograms.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
      - "The lower boundary condition is provided by magnetogram data" and "radial magnetic ﬁeld distribution on the Sun’s photospheric surface" indicate that the observable is the line-of-sight magnetic field representative of the photospheric field.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - These magnetograms are crucial for initializing both the PFSS and the enhanced ‘outﬂow’ model described in the paper.
   

### 2. In Situ Magnetic Field Observations from the OMNI Data Set (NASA/GSFC)
- **General Comments**:
   - The OMNI data set is used in the paper to compare the open magnetic flux at 1 AU predicted by both the potential field and outﬂow field models. Although not a single instrument, the OMNI data comprise in situ magnetic field measurements collected by multiple spacecraft (e.g., ACE, Wind) curated by NASA/GSFC.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - "We now compare the open ﬂux measurements predicted by our outﬂow model to measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld at 1 AU extracted from NASA/GSFC’s OMNI data set through OMNIWeb."
   
#### Data Collection Period 1: Solar Cycle 24 In Situ Measurements
- **Time Range**:
   - The in situ magnetic field data, as presented in the paper (e.g., in Figure 6), pertain to Solar Cycle 24. Specific references to Carrington rotations (for example, increases around Carrington Rotation 2160) imply that the data cover a range of rotations within roughly 2008–2019.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "Figure 6 plots the OMNI data against the ﬂux predicted by our model for various solar wind speeds, including the potential ﬁeld case..." with the x-axis indicating Carrington Rotations that fall within the timeframe of Solar Cycle 24.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Not applicable; the OMNI data consist of direct in situ measurements using spacecraft magnetometers.
- **Physical Observable**:
   - The observable is the in situ heliospheric magnetic field strength, with the study focusing on the unsigned open radial flux at 1 AU.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
      - "We assume that the total amount of radial magnetic ﬂux at 1 AU is the same as the upper corona and scale the magnetic ﬁeld strength correspondingly." 
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Results derived from the OMNI data serve as an independent observational benchmark to assess how well the modeled outﬂow field captures the open magnetic flux compared with that measured directly from the heliosphere.
