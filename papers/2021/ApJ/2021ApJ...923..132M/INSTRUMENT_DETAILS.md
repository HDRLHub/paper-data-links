## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper studies magnetic‐field turbulence within reconnection exhausts in the solar wind at 1 AU. The authors analyze four reconnection events using high‐cadence magnetic‐field data (and associated plasma measurements) from in situ spacecraft. Three events were observed by instruments onboard the Wind spacecraft (with data taken at an 11 Hz resolution) while the fourth event was detected by Cluster (with a resolution of 22 Hz, including a multi-spacecraft curlometer technique to compute the current density). The study employs methods such as the hybrid minimum variance analysis to define LMN coordinates and calculates higher-order structure functions and the Jensen–Shannon complexity–entropy index. The available observation intervals (with precise start and end times provided for each event) are critical in identifying the inertial subrange and establishing the link between intermittency (manifest as coherent structures within reconnection exhausts) and the measured decrease in entropy/increase in complexity.
