## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper presents a new model for the evolution of the solar Lyman-α line profile over the solar cycle, which is crucial for understanding the distribution and dynamics of interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen in the heliosphere. The research is based on direct observations of full-disk solar Lyman-α profiles collected with the SUMER instrument onboard the SOHO spacecraft. The dataset analyzed encompasses 43 disk-integrated profiles gathered between May 1996 and April 2009, covering nearly the entire 23rd solar cycle, including two solar minima and one maximum. These high-resolution spectral observations form the core data source for constructing and validating the new model. The study also employs Lyman-α total irradiance time series from LASP (with calibration based on UARS/SOLSTICE, and later instruments) for model scaling and temporal context.

### SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) on board SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
- **General Comments**:
  - The SUMER instrument data are the basis for the new model and all analyzed Lyman-α profiles.
  - Observations directly analyzed are 43 full-disk, disk-integrated profiles sampling the range of solar activity through the solar cycle.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The basis for our model are observations of disk-integrated proﬁles of the solar Lyman-α line measured by L15 using SUMER on board SOHO1. These proﬁles are shown collectively in Figure 1. There are 43 proﬁles observed between May 1996 and April 2009."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full-disk, disk-integrated Lyman-α line profiles
- **Time Range**: May 1996 – April 2009 (full date range covering two minima—1995, 2008—and the maximum 2000–2002 of solar activity)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "First absorption-free proﬁles were obtained from the SUMER instrument on board SOHO (Wilhelm et al. 1995), which is located in the vicinity of the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point. The measurements were performed between 1995 and 2009, i.e., during an interval covering two minima (1995, 2008) and one maximum (2000–2002) of solar activity. They were published in a series of papers by Lemaire et al. (1998, 2002); Lemaire et al. (2005), and L15. In our paper we use the data presented in the last of these papers."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Central wavelength 121.567 nm; data covers ±0.15 nm (i.e., 121.417 nm to 121.717 nm) with 0.001 nm pitch
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The resulting proﬁle is composed of 281 points at wavelengths equally spaced with a 0.001 nm pitch. During the observations, the proﬁles had been sampled at several wavelengths and the observations were subsequently deconvolved to eliminate the effect of the instrument point spread function."  
    "The absolute scaling of the proﬁles was performed by the observers by requiring that the integral of the observed proﬁle within the boundaries ±0.15 nm around the nominal wavelength of the line center is equal to the daily value of the composite series of the Lyman-α irradiance for a given day of observation (see Table A.1 from L15)."
- **Physical Observable**: Full-disk, disk-integrated spectral profiles of the solar Lyman-α emission line, capturing variations in line shape (including horns, central reversal, and asymmetry) as a function of solar cycle phase
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The model has three components that reproduce different features of the proﬁle. The main shape of the emission line that is produced in the chromosphere is modeled by the kappa function; the central reversal due to absorption in the transition region is modeled by the Gauss function; the spectral background is represented by the linear function. The coefﬁcients of all those components are linear functions of the line-integrated full-disk Lyman-α irradiance, which is the only free parameter of the model."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Observations required a specially devised scheme to measure disk-averaged profiles despite SUMER not being designed for this purpose; the method involved sampling scattered Lyman-α emission inside the instrument optics from multiple off-disk pointings and averaging.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The SUMER instrument had not been designed to provide disk-averaged proﬁles and therefore a specially devised observation scheme suggested by J.L. Bertaux had to be used. Effectively, the instrument measured the proﬁle of the solar Lyman-α radiation scattered inside the instrument optics when the boresight was directed ~2000'' off the disk center. To safeguard a more or less uniform contribution from all parts of the solar disk, observations from several pointings around the solar disk were averaged."
  - The final dataset enables modeling of solar Lyman-α-driven radiation pressure throughout the cycle.

### LASP Composite Lyman-α Irradiance Series (utilizing UARS/SOLSTICE calibration, and extended with TIMED, SORCE, proxies as needed)
- **General Comments**:
  - The time series is used for absolute scaling of the SUMER spectral profiles, determination of temporal context, and as the free parameter driving the model of profile evolution.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The composite time series of the solar Lyman-α irradiance was recapitulated by Bzowski et al. (2013). The total irradiance, which we denote Itot, is based on direct daily observations, with occasional gaps ﬁlled with values derived from proxies. The absolute calibration is based on UARS/SOLSTICE2 (Woods et al. 1996; Woods et al. 2000). Observations from later experiments, TIMED and SORCE, are scaled to this calibration."
- **Data Collection Period 1: Absolute scaling and temporal context for profile modeling**
  - **Time Range**: May 1996 – April 2009, with context from 1947 to present for irradiance trends and model recommendations
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "The series cover the time interval since 1947 until present. The Itot values for times before 1979 are obtained from scaling the solar F10.7 radio ﬂux (Tapping 2013). More recently, gaps have been ﬁlled mostly using the Mg II core to wing index (Viereck & Puga 1999)."
  - **Wavelength(s)**: Lyman-α line-integrated irradiance over 1 nm interval from 121–122 nm
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "The irradiance is integrated over the 1 nm interval from 121 to 122 nm."
  - **Physical Observable**: Line-integrated, full-disk solar Lyman-α irradiance (Itot) at daily and Carrington-rotation-averaged cadences, used to scale SUMER profile observations and provide the solar-cycle parameter for the new line profile model
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "The daily values of Itot for the dates corresponding to proﬁles observed by L15 are shown with black dots, and the subset from Lemaire et al. (2002) used by TB09, are taken in black circles."
