# Scientific Observation Instrumentation Form

## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents interferometric observations of the quiet Sun at decameter wavelengths (20 and 25 MHz) carried out from 27 May to 2 June 2014. The primary instrument is the UTR-2 radio telescope, which was operated in two different interferometric configurations (East–West and North–South) to measure fluxes, angular sizes, and brightness temperatures before and after a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 29 May 2014. These observations are supported by data from the URAN-2 radio telescope. In addition, the paper discusses earlier studies of the quiet Sun performed with several other instruments (e.g., Arecibo, Clark Lake, UTR-2 heliograph, Gauribidanur, and the Uran-1 interferometer) to compare historical parameters and observational techniques at decameter wavelengths.
