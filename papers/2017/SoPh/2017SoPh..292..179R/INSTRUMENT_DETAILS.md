## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the long-term and cycle-related relationship between the solar differential rotation and solar activity by directly analyzing sunspot group positions for the period 1874–2016. The primary research objective is to determine yearly values of the differential-rotation parameters (A and B) and examine their correlation with the revised sunspot number (as a proxy for activity). The main data sources are the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR, 1874–1976), the US Air Force Solar Optical Observing Network and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (USAF/NOAA, 1977–2016), and the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD, 1977–2016). The study uses these sunspot group datasets to calculate rotational velocities, process rotation rate transformations, and fit the differential-rotation parameters that underpin all results presented.

## Instrumentation Details

### Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR)
- **General Comments**:
  - The GPR dataset is utilized for sunspot group position measurements covering the years 1874 through 1976. These observations are central for determining the historical profile of the Sun’s differential rotation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this work the sunspot-group data from GPR (1874 – 1976), USAF/NOAA Sunspot Data, and DPD (Baranyi, Gy˝ori, and Ludm´any, 2016; Gy˝ori, Ludm´any, and Baranyi, 2017) sunspot database (1977 – 2016) were used."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Full historical analysis of sunspot position data
- **Time Range**: 1874–1976 (inclusive; entire dataset considered for differential rotation analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In this work the sunspot-group data from GPR (1874 – 1976)... were used."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (photographic observations; no explicit wavelength is listed but historical GPR data is understood to be white-light)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The GPR data were often extended by US Air Force Solar Optical Observing Network and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (USAF/NOAA) data ... Besides GPR and USAF/NOAA sunspot data, a number of other datasets were also frequently used, e.g., the Mt. Wilson dataset (Howard, Gilman, and Gilman, 1984) which consists from the areas and positions of the sunspots measured on the white-light photographs of the Sun taken with the 30-cm diameter lens at the Tower Telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory, Kodaikanal data (Gupta, Sivaraman, and Howard, 1999), Kanzelh¨ohe data (Lustig, 1983; Poljanˇci´c Beljan et al., 2014; Poljanˇci´c-Beljan et al., 2017) and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) (Sudar et al., 2017)."
- **Physical Observable**: Heliographic positions of sunspot groups (used to calculate solar rotation velocities and differential rotation parameters)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The given daily positions of the sunspot groups have been used to obtain the rotational velocities. For the groups for which the central meridian distance (CMD) was less than 58◦, which corresponds to about 0.85 of projected solar radius (see Balthasar, Vazquez, and W¨ohl, 1986), the rotation rate was calculated by division of CMD diﬀerences by elapsed time."
- **Additional Comments**: The GPR digital dataset used was compiled/maintained by the authors.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Our own GPR dig- ital dataset was used..."

### US Air Force Solar Optical Observing Network / NOAA (USAF/NOAA)
- **General Comments**:
  - The USAF/NOAA dataset extends the sunspot group position series through the interval 1977–2016, including data acquisition, quality filtering, and rotation parameter calculation.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this work the sunspot-group data from GPR (1874 – 1976), USAF/NOAA Sunspot Data, and DPD ... sunspot database (1977 – 2016) were used. ... USAF/NOAA and DPD data were downloaded from their websites (solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtm and fenyi.solarobs.csfk.- mta.hu/DPD/, respectively)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis during modern cycles
- **Time Range**: 1977–2016 (inclusive; USAF/NOAA set contains only Jan.-Sept. data for 2016)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The USAF/NOAA set contains only Jan.-Sept. data for 2016)."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light observations (platform details implied as standard white-light sunspot patrol, not explicitly stated)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "In this work the sunspot-group data from GPR (1874 – 1976), USAF/NOAA Sunspot Data, and DPD ... sunspot database (1977 – 2016) were used."
- **Physical Observable**: Heliographic positions of sunspot groups (used for rotation/differential analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The given daily positions of the sunspot groups have been used to obtain the rotational velocities."
- **Additional Comments**: Annual rotation velocities and differential-rotation coefficients derived and analyzed for trends and correlation with solar cycle
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The calculated diﬀerential-rotation parameters were compared with the solar-activity level."

### Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD)
- **General Comments**:
  - The DPD extends and complements USAF/NOAA coverage, providing independent sunspot group position data for 1977–2016. Data were directly analyzed for differential rotation profiles.
- **Supporting Quote**: "In this work the sunspot-group data from GPR (1874 – 1976), USAF/NOAA Sunspot Data, and DPD (Baranyi, Gy˝ori, and Ludm´any, 2016; Gy˝ori, Ludm´any, and Baranyi, 2017) sunspot database (1977 – 2016) were used."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Modern era sunspot position analysis
- **Time Range**: 1977–2016 (inclusive; full DPD dataset analyzed for this interval)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "DPD (Baranyi, Gy˝ori, and Ludm´any, 2016; Gy˝ori, Ludm´any, and Baranyi, 2017) sunspot database (1977 – 2016) were used."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White-light (photographic and digital sunspot images from Debrecen observatory)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) (Sudar et al., 2017)."
- **Physical Observable**: Heliographic positions of sunspot groups (for calculation of solar differential rotation parameters)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The given daily positions of the sunspot groups have been used to obtain the rotational velocities."
- **Additional Comments**: The DPD dataset was independently downloaded and processed.
  - **Supporting Quote**: "USAF/NOAA and DPD data were downloaded from their websites (solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtm and fenyi.solarobs.csfk.-
mta.hu/DPD/, respectively)."
