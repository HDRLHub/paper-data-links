## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of 134 circular-ribbon flares (CFs) observed from September 2011 to June 2017. The study includes flares of various classes (B, C, M, and X) and examines their physical properties such as location, area, equivalent radius, lifetime, and peak soft X-ray (SXR) flux. The data were primarily obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additional observations were made using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on SDO, the GOES spacecraft, and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the SOHO spacecraft. The study also explores the association of CFs with remote brightenings, type III radio bursts, jets, mini-filament eruptions, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
