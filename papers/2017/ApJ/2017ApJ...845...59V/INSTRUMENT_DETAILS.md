## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper studies the magnetic field evolution and the physical mechanisms driving the successive, homologous coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from solar Active Region (AR) NOAA 12371 during its seven-day disk passage in June 2015. Four major fast CMEs, each associated with long-duration M-class flares, are detailed with respect to their timing, initiation mechanism, and the evolution of a coronal sigmoid structure observable above the polarity inversion line (PIL). Analysis is based directly on photospheric vector magnetograms and multiwavelength coronal imaging from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), alongside white-light observations from the LASCO coronagraphs on board SOHO. The study specifically derives photospheric velocity fields, magnetic flux, electric currents, and helicity and energy injection rates from direct observations spanning June 18–25, 2015, and uses these to identify the role of shearing and converging polarities in sequential CME production. All results are dependent on data from actual observations taken during the four primary CME event days.

## Instrumentation Details

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI vector magnetic field data form the foundation for all photospheric magnetic analysis, including measurements of magnetic flux, vertical currents, and temporal tracking of footpoint shear and converging motions. Both line-of-sight and vector magnetograms are used, and Doppler velocity fields are derived for the CME source region over multiple days.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The major source of observational data used in this study is Solar Dynamics Observatory (Pesnell et al. 2012), which provides full magnetic ﬁeld measurements and multitude of coronal observations uninterruptedly."  

#### Data Collection Period 1: Analysis of AR 12371 photospheric vector field evolution and motion during CME series
- **Time Range**: 2015-06-18 through 2015-06-25 (full disk passage and CME event context)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "During the disk transit of seven days, the AR launched four sequential fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with long duration M-class ﬂares....The major source of observational data used in this study is Solar Dynamics Observatory (Pesnell et al. 2012)..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: HMI photospheric Fe I 6173 Å (line-of-sight and vector magnetograms)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the AR, obtained from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on four diﬀerent days of four major eruptions."
- **Physical Observable**: Photospheric magnetic field (line-of-sight and vector), derivation of velocity fields (footpoint motions), vertical electric currents, magnetic helicity and energy injection rates
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Velocity ﬁeld derived from tracked magnetograms indicates persistent shear and converging motions of polarity regions about the PIL."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The vector magnetic ﬁeld in the AR patch is deduced after a pipelined procedure of stokes vector inversion and ambiguity resolution (Borrero & et al 2011; Hoeksema et al. 2014; Bobra et al. 2014)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - HMI data were used continuously through all CME events for magnetic evolution studies, comparisons with a non-eruptive AR, and tracking cancellation and shearing at sub-arcsecond scales.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
  - Multiwavelength EUV image sequences from AIA provide direct visualization of coronal structures, eruption onsets, hot plasma evolution, sigmoidal arcades, and post-eruption arcades. Specific channels (94 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, 335 Å, 304 Å, 1600 Å, 171 Å) are referenced in both contextual summary and detailed image-based analysis throughout the CME events.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "To show the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) dimming, we plot in the last column of Figure 2, diﬀerence images of AIA 193˚A observations taken immediately after CMEs launch from the AR."
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Coronal and chromospheric imaging of AR 12371 for all major CME events
- **Time Range**: 2015-06-18 through 2015-06-25 (explicitly associated with CME1–CME4 on June 18, 21, 22, 25)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "In Figure 3, we plot SDO multiwavelength observations during the onset of the CME2."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 94 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, 335 Å (coronal Fe lines), 304 Å (He II, chromospheric/transition region), 1600 Å (upper photosphere/transition region), 171 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "AIA 304˚A observations show contonuous ﬁla-ment trace (similar to FR) from N1 through PIL to P1 and is a signature of being supported by the crossings of L1 and L2."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We use AIA 94˚A observations instead 131˚A as in other events."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "AIA 1600˚A observations show contonuous filaments ... AIA 171 during posteruption phase."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal plasma morphology, sigmoids, flare ribbons, post-flare arcades, filament channels, EUV dimming (density depletion), eruption initiation
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Morphological study delineates a pre-eruptive coronal sigmoid structure above the polarity inversion line (PIL) similar to Moore et al study."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The AIA 94Å images reveal the initiation of eruption at 00:45 UT on June 21 with the brightening of loop set L1. From then, the brightening of L1 increasingly intensifies and the distinction between L1 and L2 disappears by the emergent of forming continuous loop set L3 (FR)."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Specific analysis of pre-eruption, eruption, and post-flare evolution uses direct AIA data in both temporal and spatial sequence for all four major CME events.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO C2 and C3 white-light coronagraphs are used to directly observe and time the major CMEs produced by AR 12371, measuring their kinematics such as speed, propagation directions, and association with the source active region at specific times.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The whitelight CME observations are obtained from Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueckner et al. 1995) onboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME kinematics and morphology for all eruptions
- **Time Range**: CME1—2015-06-18 17:24 UT (C2 appearance), CME2—2015-06-21 02:36 UT (C2), CME3—2015-06-22 18:36 UT (C2), CME4—2015-06-25 08:00 UT (C2), further extended through CME transit in LASCO field of view
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "CME1 occurred on June 18 when AR was at 48◦East longitude from the central meridian, and emerged on East limb at 17:24 UT in C2 and 18:30 UT in C3 ﬁeld of view (FOV)."
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "CME2 occured on June 21 ... appears from 02:30 UT in C2 and 3:30 UT in C3 FOV."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraphic visible continuum)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The whitelight CME observations are obtained from Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO, Brueckner et al. 1995)..."
- **Physical Observable**: CME leading edge, core structure, three-part CME morphology, propagation speed (plane-of-sky), directionality (halo, partial-halo, limb), temporal onset in relation to source active region position
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The CME speed is measured in plane-of-sky and some of these quantities are taken from LASCO CME catalog, GOES ﬂare catalog. The LASCO observations of these four CME cases (in each row) are depicted in Figure 2."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  - All quantitative CME kinematical results and eruption sequences are based on direct LASCO C2/C3 data for these events, distinguished from catalog-based or literature values through explicit referencing of first detection and field of view coverage.
