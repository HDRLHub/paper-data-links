## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents detailed observations of a twin coronal mass ejection (CME) produced by a mini‐filament–driven blowout jet. Using high spatial and temporal imaging from multiple instruments, the authors document the activation and eruption of the filament, its magnetic reconnection with ambient open field lines, and the subsequent formation and deflection of the jet which later appears as two distinct CMEs (a jet‐like and a bubble‐like component). The study leverages high-resolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and Hα images, white‐light coronagraph observations, radio dynamic spectra, and a coronal magnetic field extrapolation model, with observation time stamps spanning from the early pre-eruption phase (~02:58 UT) through the eruption and jet deflection (up to ~07:58 UT for magnetic field evolution and extending into the outer corona via LASCO images).

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
- **General Comments**:
   - AIA provides high spatial (0.6″ per pixel) and high temporal (12 s in EUV; 24 s in UV; 1-hour in visible) resolution full-disk images of the Sun.
   - It observes in multiple wavelengths (seven EUV channels, two UV channels, and one visible channel), with the study specifically using 171, 304, 94, and 211 Å channels to capture both cool and hot plasma components.
   - The images are differentially rotated to a reference time (04:15 UT) to account for solar rotation.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “...we use observations mainly from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)... AIA takes images of the Sun with seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV), two UV, and one visible wavelength channels. The spatial resolution of the AIA images is of 0′′.6, and the cadences for the EUV, UV, and visible channels are 12 s, 24 s, and an hour, respectively. The eruption can be observed at all AIA EUV channels, and we mainly use the 171, 304, 94 and 211˚A images.”

#### Data Collection Period 1: Filament Activation and Eruption
- **Time Range**: Approximately 03:30 UT to 04:10 UT (2015 August 23)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The activation and initiation of the mini‐ﬁlament eruption are shown in Figure 2 using the AIA 304 ˚A images.... after the brightenings and intermittent jet-like activities, the ﬁlament started to erupt at about 04:10 UT...”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Mainly 304 Å (captures cool plasma, T ∼ 10^5 K)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the blowout jets characterized initially narrow spire that later broader; ... a cool component (T ∼10^5 K) visible in EUV 304˚A images...”
- **Physical Observable**: Filament morphology, brightening, jet-like ejections, slow rise motion.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “…before the violent eruption of the ﬁlament it underwent a slow rising phase at a projection speed of 3–8 km s^−1.”

#### Data Collection Period 2: Magnetic Reconnection and Jet Formation
- **Time Range**: Approximately 04:10 UT to 04:30 UT (2015 August 23)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the erupting ﬁlament transformed into a blowout jet via its magnetic reconnection with the ambient open magnetic ﬁelds... (see the animation of Figure 3 covering 04:10–04:30 UT).”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Multiple channels – notably 94 Å (high-temperature response), 211 Å (running-difference images for reconnection features), and 171 Å (to observe the jet’s spire and U-shaped magnetic structure).
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...by overlaying the axis of the erupting ﬁlament and the HMI LOS magnetogram on the AIA 211˚A running-difference image at 04:26 UT... the AIA 94˚A images in panel (b1)–(b4) further displayed the rapid formation and shrinkage process of L2.”
- **Physical Observable**: Evolution of magnetic reconnection (formation of post-reconnection loops L2 and L3), jet deflection, and unwinding motion.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the detected type-III radio burst and the rearrangement of the coronal loops do indicate the occurrence of the reconnection.”

   - It helps to investigate the large-scale magnetic topology and the interaction between the jet and remote open field lines.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “In addition, the simultaneous observations of WIND/WAVES are utilized to detect the associated interplanetary radio signals. To compensate for solar rotation, all the images taken at different times are differentially rotated to a reference time of 04:15 UT.” (and later, “The three-dimensional coronal magnetic ﬁeld is extrapolated based on the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld using the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS; Schrijver & De Rosa 2003) model...”)
