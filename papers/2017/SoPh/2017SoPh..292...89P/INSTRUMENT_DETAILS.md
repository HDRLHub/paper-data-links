## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper presents a parametric and general framework to infer the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun and at 1 AU, with extensions to the stellar realm impacting exoplanet habitability. The methodology uses as input the magnetic helicity of the CME’s solar source region (derived from solar photospheric data) and geometrical parameters of the CME obtained from multi-viewpoint coronagraphic images. The study performs Monte Carlo simulations using statistical distributions of these input parameters derived from direct observations of 42 solar active regions and 65 observed CMEs, largely spanning Solar Cycle 24. The Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model is specifically used to deduce CME geometrical parameters from coronagraph data of the SOHO and STEREO missions. The magnetic cloud observations at 1 AU are directly referenced using linear force-free parameter fits for 162 magnetic clouds observed at 1 AU. The findings are compared with observed distributions of CME-related parameters, and the implications for planetary magnetospheres are discussed in the context of observed exoplanets and their host stars.

## Instrumentation Details

### SOHO and STEREO Coronagraphs
- **General Comments**:
  - Combined coronagraphic images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft are used for forward modeling to derive CME geometrical inputs (radius, aspect ratio, length) via the GCS model. Only direct data used for CME fitting is included.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Such observations are achieved by coronagraphs typically covering the outer corona."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME Geometrical Parameter Acquisition for Parametric Study
- **Time Range**:  
  Observational basis includes CMEs from 65 distinct events characterized in the literature and referenced by their distribution in the parametric study, typically encompassing Solar Cycle 24 (~2007–2012), with input distributions tied to those events.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Our simulations randomly sampled 10^4 values of active region (AR) Hm, CME aspect ratio k and angular half-width w from the observed distributions of 42 ARs (Tziotziou, Georgoulis, and Raouaﬁ, 2012) and 65 CMEs (Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard, 2009; Bosman et al., 2012), respectively."
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  White-light continuum as observed by space-based coronagraphs.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Such observations are achieved by coronagraphs typically covering the outer corona."
- **Physical Observable**:  
  CME linear size, aspect ratio, angular half-width, and other geometrical parameters for modeling.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "determine a set of CME geometrical parameters (e.g. radius R, length L) from forward-modeling geometrical fits of multi-view coronal observations of the analyzed CME"
- **Additional Comments**:  
  The GCS model is explicitly used as the fitting procedure for these images.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "To obtain the geometrical parameters R and L we adopt the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) forward fitting model of Thernisien, Vourlidas, and Howard (2009). This is a geometrical flux-rope model routinely used to fit the large-scale appearance of flux-rope CMEs in multi-viewpoint observations acquired by coronagraphs onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft."

### Photospheric Vector Magnetographs (Solar Active Region Helicity)
- **General Comments**:
  - Source region magnetic helicity values are directly obtained from observations of solar active regions, feeding the core parametric input for CME modeling.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "we perform Monte-Carlo simulations picking up 10^4 random deviates from the observed distributions of the input magnetic (Hm) and geometrical (k and w) parameters of our method"

#### Data Collection Period 1: Active Region Magnetic Helicity Distribution
- **Time Range**:  
  Magnetic helicity values for 42 solar active regions collected and analyzed over a span referenced directly to Tziotziou, Georgoulis, and Raouaﬁ (2012); these span years during Solar Cycle 23/24, specifically those regions for which reliable vector magnetograph data was available.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the observed distributions of 42 ARs (Tziotziou, Georgoulis, and Raouaﬁ, 2012)"
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
  Photospheric vector magnetograms (typically Fe I 6173 Å for SDO/HMI or similar lines for ground-based/in-space instruments).
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Determine the magnetic helicity Hm of the CME solar source region using various methods based on theory and photospheric observations (Pariat et al., 2006; R´egnier and Canﬁeld, 2006; Georgoulis, Tziotziou, and Raouaﬁ, 2012; Valori, D´emoulin, and Pariat, 2012; Moraitis et al., 2014, among others)."
- **Physical Observable**:  
  Magnetic helicity in the solar active region supplying CME input—directly derived from vector magnetic field measurements.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Magnetic helicity is a signed quantity, depending on its handedness. For the remainder of this article, and for brevity, when referring to magnetic helicity we will refer to its magnitude."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  Only those active regions with precisely quantified helicity values (not theoretical models or indirect inferences) are used.

### Wind and Other L1 In-Situ Magnetometers (Magnetic Cloud Validation Data)
- **General Comments**:
  - In-situ magnetic field magnitude data for 162 magnetic clouds at 1 AU are utilized (with explicit reference to Wind mission database and published magnetic cloud lists).
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "magnetic fields, BMC, for 162 magnetic clouds (MCs) observed at 1 AU as resulting from their linear force-free fits (Lynch et al., 2003; Lepping et al., 2006), and PDFobs."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Interplanetary Magnetic Cloud Events at L1
- **Time Range**:  
  The time frame corresponds to the Wind magnetic cloud catalogue period referenced in Lepping et al. (2006), i.e., 1995–2003.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "A summary of WIND magnetic clouds for years 1995–2003: model-fitted parameters, associated errors and classifications."
- **Wavelength(s)**:

  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "magnetic fields, BMC, for 162 magnetic clouds (MCs) observed at 1 AU as resulting from their linear force-free fits (Lynch et al., 2003; Lepping et al., 2006)"
- **Physical Observable**:  
  Magnetic field magnitudes and fits for magnetic clouds at 1 AU.
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "These near-Sun magnetic fields were then extrapolated to 1 AU, therefore leading to 180,000 1 AU CME magnetic field values, resulting from the matrix of 10^4 B∗ and 18 αB values discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. We found that an index αB = -1.6 ±0.2 led to a ballpark, statistical agreement between the model-predicted ICME magnetic field distributions and actual ICME observations at 1 AU."
- **Additional Comments**:  
  This magnetic cloud data is used exclusively for validation of model extrapolations to 1 AU.

All other references to stellar observations, MHD simulations, and comparative exoplanet data rely on previously published empirical relationships or theoretical frameworks rather than new or directly analyzed data.**
