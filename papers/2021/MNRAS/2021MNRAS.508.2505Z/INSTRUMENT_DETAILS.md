## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper compares the characteristics of newborn magnetars formed in the death of massive stars versus those born from the merger of compact objects. It focuses on analyzing the early X‐ray afterglow lightcurves and prompt gamma‐ray lightcurves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Swift mission. In addition, the study cross-calibrates the gamma‐ray fluences using data from Konus/Wind. Key observables include break times, spectral photon indices, fluxes, and isotropic energy releases, which are used to infer physical parameters of the magnetars such as the magnetic field strength and initial spin period.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Swift Mission
- **General Comments**:
   - BAT is used to obtain the prompt gamma‐ray lightcurves of GRBs. It plays a critical role in providing the primary gamma-ray data that initiates the GRB trigger.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “Their prompt gamma‐ray lightcurves observed with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X‐ray afterglow lightcurves observed with XRT are taken from the Swift data archive (Evans et al. 2010).”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - No explicit start and end dates are given for BAT observations in the context. It is referred to as part of the current Swift GRB catalog.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Energy band: 15–150 keV.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “BAT is sensitive in the energy range of 15–150 keV.”
- **Physical Observable(s)**:
   - The BAT observations provide the prompt gamma‐ray fluences and spectral data which are used to estimate the isotropic jet energy (E_jet) of the GRBs.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The uniform use of a single power-law model for BAT spectra is noted, even though it may lead to a systematic underestimation of the fluence.

### 2. Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the Swift Mission
- **General Comments**:
   - XRT is responsible for recording the early X-ray afterglow lightcurves of GRBs. These lightcurves often contain a shallow-decay phase attributed to the dipole radiation from newborn magnetars.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Rowlinson et al. (2013) showed that about half of the lightcurves of sGRBs observed with the Swift/XRT from Dec. 2004 to May 2012 can be ﬁtted with the magnetar DR model.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - December 2004 – May 2012.
   - **Supporting Quote**: As above.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - X-ray wavelengths (typical XRT observations are in the soft X-ray band, usually around 0.3–10 keV, although the exact band is not stated explicitly in the text).
- **Physical Observable(s)**:
   - Key observables include the shallow-decay segment of the lightcurve, the break time (t_b), characteristic luminosity (L_b), spectral photon indices (Γ_jet and Γ_wind), and flux decay slopes. These observables are used in fitting the dipole radiation model to extract magnetar parameters.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The XRT data are essential for fitting the magnetar spin-down signatures and for deriving subsequent physical parameters like the braking index, initial spin period (P_0), and magnetic field strength (B_p).

### 3. Konus/Wind
- **General Comments**:
   - Konus/Wind is employed as a complementary instrument to Swift/BAT to evaluate the systematic differences in gamma-ray fluence measurements. It provides observations over a much wider energy range and collects a relatively hard burst sample.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Konus/Wind is sensitive in a much wider energy band (20keV–2MeV) than BAT. It may collect a relatively hard GRB sample.”
- **Data Collection Period**:
   - While a dedicated date range is not specified, the analysis is based on a sample of 168 GRBs simultaneously detected by BAT and Konus/Wind as reported by Tsvetkova et al. (2021).
- **Wavelength(s)**:
   - Energy band: 20 keV – 2 MeV.
   - **Supporting Quote**: As above.
- **Physical Observable(s)**:
   - Konus/Wind provides gamma-ray fluence measurements which are compared and corrected against those from BAT. This cross-calibration helps in estimating the total fluence and energy release of the GRB jets.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - The utilization of Konus/Wind data is important to assess potential systematic impacts arising from the use of a single power-law model applied to BAT data.
