## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper focuses on the early diagnostics of the geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions based on measuring the total unsigned line-of-sight photospheric magnetic flux in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) arcades and dimmings. The study transitions a diagnostic tool previously based on SOHO-era instruments (EIT and MDI, 1996–2011) to the use of SDO instruments (AIA and HMI, 2010 onward). The research is grounded in direct comparative analysis of overlapping SOHO and SDO data sets and utilizes specific observation periods, including detailed analysis of events from 2010–2011 with both SOHO and SDO and further cases through 2015 for SDO. The results rely on extracted EUV images and magnetograms from these instruments to cross-calibrate flux measurements and area extractions, enabling empirical predictions of geomagnetic storm and Forbush decrease intensity and timing based solely on solar surface observables.

## Instrumentation Details

### Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - EIT 195 Å images are used to extract areas of post-eruption arcades and dimmings for cross-calibration and diagnostic development. The EIT data serves as the reference standard for method transfer to SDO/AIA, with images directly processed and analyzed to delineate eruptive features and measure area in specific events.
- **Supporting Quote**: "These eruptions were analyzed using data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Domingo, Fleck, and Poland, 1995), namely solar images obtained with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995) in the 195 ˚A channel..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Detailed overlap period for direct SOHO/SDO comparison (Group A events)
- **Time Range**: 2010-05-23 to 2010-07-19 (full event dates with images at 12-min intervals around event times)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Group A includes relatively weak eruptions in 2010 May – July for which EIT images observed with a detailed 12-min interval were still available. ... In most cases of Group A, an interval starting short before the eruption onset and lasting 3 – 4 hours afterwards was considered, i.e. a set of 15 – 20 images was analyzed."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "solar images obtained with the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Delaboudini`ere et al., 1995) in the 195 ˚A channel..."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV emission in post-eruption arcades and coronal dimmings
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We extract arcades and dimmings in EIT and AIA images with the same techniques as those used in Article I, based on formal criteria referring to a brightness analysis, as described below. These criteria detect the features of interest more or less reliably..."
- **Additional Comments**: Used as the baseline for cross-calibrating AIA 193 Å measurements and testing area extraction consistency.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Lower cadence EIT images for major eruptions (Group B events)
- **Time Range**: 2011-09-06 to 2015-11-09 (events with images at ∼12-hour intervals for post-eruption analysis)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "After 2010 – 2011, data on solar eruptions are obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We use relatively short intervals of overlapping EIT – AIA...detailed observations and, additionally, a number of large eruptions over the next ﬁve years with the 12-hour cadence EIT images to adapt the SOHO diagnostic tool to SDO data."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "it is reasonable to use now the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) images produced in the 193 ˚A channel instead of the SOHO/EIT 195 ˚A images, because both EUV channels have a close temperature response with peaks at about 1.3 – 1.5 MK."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV arcades and dimmings as revealed by difference imaging
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For each event we extracted the arcades and dimmings in the images produced with both EIT and AIA and compared their characteristics, including their quantitative areas."
- **Additional Comments**: Used for cross-comparison with nearly simultaneous AIA images for method development.

### Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/MDI line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms are used for direct calculation of ER-associated magnetic flux in pre-eruption images, allowing comparison with SDO/HMI for method transfer and calibration.
- **Supporting Quote**: "magnetograms acquired with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et  al., 1995)"

#### Data Collection Period 1: Comparative analysis of AR magnetic fluxes during instrument overlap
- **Time Range**: 2010-05 to 2011-04 (specific AR observations for 34 largest sunspot regions)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Instead, we will compare the total magnetic ﬂuxes of the 34 largest ARs, which were observed near the solar disk center during the concurrent MDI and HMI observations and had the sunspot area greater than 100... over the period from 2010 May to 2011 April."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograph)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "magnetograms acquired with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et  al., 1995)"
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight component of photospheric magnetic field, unsigned magnetic flux
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For each of these ARs, using data from both magnetographs, we calculated the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux from the line-of-sight photospheric ﬁeld within a single topologically-connected area, where the magnetic ﬁeld strength exceeded 10 % of the maximum value over the entire magnetogram, but was not less than 15 G."
- **Additional Comments**: Data from SOHO/MDI are directly compared with HMI data for cross-calibration and to derive flux scaling relationships.

### Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - AIA 193 Å images are the primary replacement for SOHO/EIT 195 Å for extracting dimming and arcade regions after 2010, with detailed processing and cross-calibration done against EIT in periods of data overlap. AIA data spanning from 2010 onwards are also the basis for current and future applications of the diagnostic tool.
- **Supporting Quote**: "For the extraction of the arcade and dimming areas it is reasonable to use now the SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) images produced in the 193 ˚A channel instead of the SOHO/EIT 195 ˚A images..."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlap calibration and acquisition for method transfer (Group A and B events)
- **Time Range**: 2010-05-23 to 2015-11-09 (covering events in Table 1; used systematically with SOHO overlap and exclusively thereafter)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Table 1 lists eruptions of Groups A and B selected for comparison of the arcade and dimming areas in the EIT 195 ˚A and AIA 193 ˚A images."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "produced in the 193 ˚A channel instead of the SOHO/EIT 195 ˚A images, because both EUV channels have a close temperature response with peaks at about 1.3 – 1.5 MK."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV arcades and coronal dimmings
  - **Supporting Quote**: "We extract arcades and dimmings in EIT and AIA images with the same techniques as those used in Article I, based on formal criteria referring to a brightness analysis, as described below. These criteria detect the features of interest more or less reliably..."
- **Additional Comments**: Data are normalized and cross-calibrated by exposure time (2.0 or 2.9 s typical), and image difference techniques are directly applied.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Application to major AR eruptions and space weather events in Solar Cycle 24
- **Time Range**: 2012-03-07 to 2015-12-28 (see Table 3 for specific AR eruption dates analyzed for space weather impact)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Table 3 presents the results of the SDO-based diagnosis of ﬁve ﬂare-associated eruptions in ARs carried out according to the procedure described in the previous section. The table lists parameters of a solar event in the second to sixth columns, including the date, peak time, coordinates, and GOES class of a related ﬂare..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 193 Å
  - **Supporting Quote**: "extraction of dimming and arcade areas for a particular eruption, it is suﬃcient to apply the cross-calibration factor between the EIT 195 ˚A and AIA 193 ˚A images."
- **Physical Observable**: EUV arcades and dimmings used as proxies for the magnetic flux contributing to CMEs
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The solar rotation in the analyzed images was removed and a background pre-eruption image was subtracted from each subsequent one to obtain ﬁxed-base diﬀerence images."

### Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO
- **General Comments**:
  - HMI provides line-of-sight magnetograms of the photospheric field, used post-2010 for direct measurement of unsigned magnetic flux in event regions defined by AIA images. HMI now replaces SOHO/MDI in the diagnostic workflow, and cross-calibration analyses were performed during the overlap period.
- **Supporting Quote**: "Calculation of the magnetic ﬂux in the extracted areas should be done with data from the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012)."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Overlap calibration with SOHO/MDI
- **Time Range**: 2010-05 to 2011-04 (comparison of large active region fluxes, 34 ARs as in Table 2)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The observation date, time, NOAA number, coordinates, and maximum areas of these ARs are listed in Table 2. For each of these ARs, using data from both magnetographs, we calculated the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux..."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograph)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Calculation of the magnetic ﬂux in the extracted areas should be done with data from the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012)."
- **Physical Observable**: Line-of-sight component of the photospheric magnetic field, area-integrated unsigned magnetic flux
  - **Supporting Quote**: "For each of these ARs, using data from both magnetographs, we calculated the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux from the line-of-sight photospheric ﬁeld within a single topologically-connected area, where the magnetic ﬁeld strength exceeded 10 % of the maximum value over the entire magnetogram, but was not less than 15 G."
- **Additional Comments**: Direct cross-comparison with MDI to produce a calibration factor for consistent flux estimation.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Application to AR eruptions and post-2011 diagnosis
- **Time Range**: 2012-03-07 to 2015-12-28 (applied for extracting magnetic flux in AIA-defined dimming and arcade areas for geoeffectiveness prediction)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Table 3 presents the results of the SDO-based diagnosis of ﬁve ﬂare-associated eruptions in ARs carried out according to the procedure described in the previous section. The table lists parameters of a solar event in the second to sixth columns, including the date, peak time, coordinates, and GOES class of a related ﬂare (second to ﬁfth columns), and a total unsigned magnetic ﬂux calculated from HMI magnetograms in dimmings and arcades in the sixth column."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograph)
  - **Supporting Quote**: "Calculation of the magnetic ﬂux in the extracted areas should be done with data from the SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012)."
- **Physical Observable**: Unsigned line-of-sight magnetic flux under post-eruption EUV structures
  - **Supporting Quote**: "The direct measurement of the magnetic ﬂux from the photospheric magnetograms without extrapolation causes an additional overestimate by a factor varying from one event to another. Thus, the actual ﬂux in a magnetic cloud should presumably be less than our estimates by a factor of 4 – 10."
- **Additional Comments**: Forms the empirical basis for Solar Cycle 24 prediction of space weather event strengths.
