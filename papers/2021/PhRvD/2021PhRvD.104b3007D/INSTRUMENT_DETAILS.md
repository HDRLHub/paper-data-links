1. # Third Interplanetary Network (IPN3)
   - **General Comments**:
     - IPN3 is a network of spacecraft carrying X‐ray and gamma‐ray sensitive instruments. In this study it provided the burst data for SGR1935+2154 by contributing 159 events as listed in the IPN3 SGR list.
     - It is used to monitor soft gamma-ray bursts over an extended period, enabling the cumulative time series analysis presented.
   - **Supporting Quote**: 
     - "We apply our methods to burst data from the Third Interplanetary Network (IPN3 [32])."
     - "159 events identified in the IPN3 SGR list for SGR1935+2154 as of 2021 February 1."
   - #### Data Collection Period: Overall Observations up to February 1, 2021
     - **Time Range**: Data were incorporated from observations ending on February 1, 2021.
     - **Supporting Quote**: "159 events identified in the IPN3 SGR list for SGR1935+2154 as of 2021 February 1."
   - #### Wavelength(s):
     - X-ray and gamma-ray.
     - **Supporting Quote**: "IPN3 includes numerous spacecraft with X-ray and gamma-ray sensitive instruments..."
   - #### Physical Observable:
     - Timing and detection of soft gamma-ray bursts.
     - **Supporting Quote**: "...data were folded at various trial periods" (context implies these bursts form the basis for the time clustering analysis).

2. # Konus Instrument on the Wind Spacecraft
   - **General Comments**:
     - The Konus instrument is prominently noted among the IPN3 detectors. It operates from a strategic orbital position around the sun at Lagrange point 1, which provides a near‐continuous, unobstructed view of the entire sky and delivers a constant background compared to low‐earth orbit instruments.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "but notably the Konus instrument on the Wind spacecraft. This instrument is in orbit around the sun at Lagrange point 1, far from earth, and so provides a nearly continuous, unobstructed view of the entire sky, and a more constant background than for low-earth orbit instruments."
   - #### Data Collection Period:
     - While no explicit start and end dates are given, its observations are part of the same data set used from IPN3 (up to February 1, 2021) for monitoring SGR1935+2154.
     - **Supporting Context**: Its continuous monitoring capability is highlighted in the context of long-term time series analysis.
   - #### Wavelength(s):
     - Gamma rays (sensitive to soft gamma-ray bursts).
     - **Supporting Quote**: Implicit via its inclusion among gamma-ray instruments.
   - #### Physical Observable:
     - Detection and timing of gamma-ray bursts.
     - **Supporting Quote**: Its role in providing a "nearly continuous, unobstructed view" supports the tracking of burst events needed for the periodic windowed behavior analysis.

3. # Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope
   - **General Comments**:
     - This instrument is mentioned in the context of verifying prediction accuracy; a burst detected by Fermi confirmed the occurrence of an event within one of the predicted activity windows.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "On June 24, 2021 a burst was detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, in our predicted window."
   - #### Data Collection Period:
     - **Time Range**: A burst detection was recorded on June 24, 2021.
     - **Supporting Quote**: Directly as above.
   - #### Wavelength(s):
     - Gamma rays.
     - **Supporting Context**: As a gamma-ray telescope, it monitors high-energy bursts.
   - #### Physical Observable:
     - Timing and detection of gamma-ray bursts, used here as a cross-check against the predicted active windows derived from the analysis.

4. # Next Generation Time Domain Instruments (Future Surveys)
   - **General Comments**:
     - A suite of upcoming instruments is cited as examples of future wide-field and high-sensitivity surveys that will expand the database of repeating burst sources. Although not directly used in the analysis, they are mentioned as complementary future tools.
   - **Supporting Quote**:
     - "Numerous next generation time domain surveys in a wide range of wavelength bands (e.g. LSST [33] in the optical, DSA-2000 [34] and CMB-S4 [35] in the radio and submillimeter, wide-ﬁeld instruments such as STROBE-X WFM [36] and SVOM ECLAIRs [37] in the X-ray/gamma ray bands) will greatly increase the database and diversity of repeating sources with possible PWB."
   - #### Data Collection Period:
     - No specific observation dates or operational time ranges are provided as these instruments represent future capabilities.
   - #### Wavelength(s):
     - LSST: Optical.
     - DSA-2000: Radio.
     - CMB-S4: Submillimeter.
     - STROBE-X WFM and SVOM ECLAIRs: X-ray/gamma ray.
   - #### Physical Observable:
     - LSST: Optical variability/transients.
     - DSA-2000: Radio bursts and transient phenomena.
     - CMB-S4: High precision cosmic microwave background measurements (with potential for submillimeter transient studies).
     - STROBE-X WFM and SVOM ECLAIRs: Wide-field monitoring of X-ray/gamma-ray transients.
   - **Additional Comments**:
     - These instruments are highlighted for their potential to detect and characterize periodic windowed behavior in astrophysical burst sources in future surveys.
