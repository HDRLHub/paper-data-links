produce the script. We need to construct queries for each instrument mentioned in the context, ensuring we use the correct time ranges and wavelengths. We will use the SunPy library to interact with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) and construct the queries. The instruments we need to query are AIA, HMI, GOES, LASCO, and WAVES. We will print out the query results and comment out the `Fido.fetch` commands.
