**Explanation:**
- **Time Range**: The script uses a broad time range from 2010 to 2015, as specified in the context. This range covers the data collection period for the study.
- **SDO/HMI Query**: This query retrieves vector magnetic field data, which is crucial for analyzing the magnetic properties of active regions before solar flares.
- **SDO/AIA Query**: The 1600 Å wavelength is specifically targeted as it is used for identifying flare ribbons, which are key to understanding the spatial relationship between flares and magnetic fields.
- **Output**: The script prints out the results of the queries. The actual data download commands are commented out to prevent unintentional data transfer during script testing or review. This script is tailored to the specific needs of the study as described in the context, focusing on the instruments and data types that are directly relevant to the research objectives.
