1. SDO/HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory)
   - General Comments:
     - HMI is used to produce full‐disk, line‐of‐sight magnetograms of the Sun.
     - It provides details on the magnetic field distribution, allowing the determination of polarity inversion lines (PIL) and flux rope footpoint locations.
   - Detector/Observables:
     - Uses the 6173 Å spectral absorption line to measure the magnetic field.
     - Provides high-resolution magnetograms (the paper mentions images “saturated at ±200 G”).
   - Time Range:
     - Although the paper does not specify a continuous observing period, specific events are referenced with HMI imagery. For example, in Event 10 an HMI magnetogram “approximately two days before the eruption” is used; this corresponds to a time around SOL2012-06-14 (the eruption time is given as 13 UT), indicating that HMI data was obtained roughly in mid-June 2012.
   - Supporting Quote:
     - “Figure 2a shows an SDO/HMI line‐of‐sight (LOS) magnetogram approximately two days before the eruption…”


2. SDO/AIA (Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory)
   - General Comments:
     - AIA provides high-resolution EUV and UV images of the solar corona, crucial for identifying eruptive structures such as sigmoids, filaments, and post-eruption arcades (PEAs).
     - It is used to observe various features associated with flux rope formation and evolution.
   - Detectors / Wavelengths / Observables:
     - Channels include:
       • 131 Å – used to image hot, flaring structures and sigmoidal features (e.g. in Event 10, a forward-S sigmoid was observed).
       • 171 Å – captures cooler coronal structures and filament details (as seen in Event 17’s filament observations).
       • 211 Å – used to view post-eruption arcades and overlying coronal loops (e.g. for determining arcade orientations).
       • 304 Å – employed to track flare ribbons which help indicate the flux rope’s helicity.
   - Time Range:
     - The AIA observations are synchronized with the eruption events. For instance, images from the 131 Å channel in Event 10 and 171/211/304 Å images in Event 17 are gathered around the eruption times (e.g. Event 10’s eruption on SOL2012-06-14 near 13 UT and Event 17 on SOL2013-04-11 at approximately 07 UT).
   - Supporting Quote:
     - “Figure 2b shows a sigmoid seen in EUV that also suggests positive chirality…. (E.g., the AIA 131 Å images capture the forward-S sigmoid.)”
     
3. Hinode/XRT (X-Ray Telescope onboard Hinode [Solar-B])
   - General Comments:
     - XRT provides soft X-ray images of the solar corona with the capability to distinguish hot plasma structures associated with eruptive events.
     - It helps in identifying eruptive sigmoidal structures and the evolving flux rope configuration.
   - Detectors / Wavelengths / Observables:
     - Uses various focal plane analysis filters (e.g. “Beryllium thin” filter and “Open” filter) to capture X-ray emission over a wide temperature range (typically a few MK up to 10 MK).
     - Observes the detailed structure of erupting flux ropes in soft X-rays.
   - Time Range:
     - In Event 17, “reverse‐colour soft X‐ray images taken with Hinode/XRT” capture an erupting reverse-S sigmoid. This event is dated SOL2013-04-11 around 07 UT, so the XRT observations are associated with this eruption time.
   - Supporting Quote:
     - “Figure 4a. Reverse-colour soft X-ray images taken with Hinode/XRT, showing an erupting reverse-S sigmoid … Filter wheel 1 is in the ‘Beryllium thin’…”
     
4. Wind (In Situ Observations from the Wind Spacecraft – MFI and SWE Instruments)
   - General Comments:
     - Wind provides in situ measurements of the interplanetary medium at L1, capturing the magnetic field, plasma properties, and solar wind parameters.
     - It is pivotal for identifying and characterizing the flux rope structure within ICMEs as they pass near Earth.
   - Detectors / Wavelengths / Observables:
     - Wind Magnetic Fields Investigation (MFI) measures the vector magnetic field.
     - Wind Solar Wind Experiment (SWE) records solar wind speed, proton density, temperature, and plasma β.
     - Observables include enhanced magnetic field magnitude, smooth rotation in magnetic field components, and signatures such as shock arrival times.
   - Time Range:
     - The paper provides detailed time ranges for each event’s in situ observation. For example, in Event 10 the flux rope is observed with a leading edge at 2012-06-16, 22:10 UT and a trailing edge at 2012-06-17, 12:30 UT.
     - Additional events list similar UT windows corresponding to the passage of ICMEs past L1.
   - Supporting Quote:
     - “The ICME was preceded by a shock (red line), and the flux rope (bounded between the pair of blue lines) is clearly identified from the enhanced magnetic field and smooth rotation of the field direction. (See Table 3 for the detailed time range, e.g. Event 10: 2012-06-16, 22:10 to 2012-06-17, 12:30 UT.)”
     
5. MESSENGER (Supplementary In Situ Observations)
   - General Comments:
     - MESSENGER is mentioned as having partly observed certain events, supplementing the in situ dataset.
     - In the context of this paper, it provides ancillary information when its trajectory lies close to the Sun–Earth line.
   - Detectors / Observables:
     - Although the specific instruments on MESSENGER are not elaborated in the provided text, it is known to carry instruments for magnetic field and plasma measurements around Mercury.
   - Time Range:
     - Event 18 is described as “a lineup event which was also partly observed by MESSENGER.” This event is dated SOL2013-07-09 with an eruption time around 14 UT, so the MESSENGER observations are relevant to this timeframe.
   - Supporting Quote:
     - “Event number 18 is a lineup event which was also partly observed by MESSENGER, situated only a few degrees away from the Sun–Earth line [Möstl et al., 2018].”
