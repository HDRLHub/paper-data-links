**produce the script**. We need to construct queries for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), as well as the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). These instruments were used extensively in the study to observe different aspects of solar eruptions from NOAA AR 11429. The queries will focus on the specific time ranges and wavelengths mentioned in the context to ensure the data retrieved is relevant to the study's objectives.

**Script**:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# Define the observation period for SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI
aia_hmi_start_time = '2012-03-06T00:00:00'
aia_hmi_end_time = '2012-03-10T19:00:00'
aia_hmi_time_range = a.Time(aia_hmi_start_time, aia_hmi_end_time)

# AIA instrument details
aia_instrument = a.Instrument("AIA")
aia_wavelengths = a.Wavelength(94 * u.angstrom, 335 * u.angstrom)  # Example range covering some AIA channels

# HMI instrument details
hmi_instrument = a.Instrument("HMI")
hmi_wavelengths = a.Wavelength(6173 * u.angstrom)  # Typical HMI wavelength

# LASCO instrument details for three specific eruption times
lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")
lasco_times = [a.Time('2012-03-07T01:30:00'), a.Time('2012-03-09T04:26:00'), a.Time('2012-03-10T18:00:00')]

# Construct queries for AIA and HMI
aia_query = Fido.search(aia_hmi_time_range, aia_instrument, aia_wavelengths)
hmi_query = Fido.search(aia_hmi_time_range, hmi_instrument, hmi_wavelengths)

# Construct queries for LASCO at specific times
lasco_queries = [Fido.search(time, lasco_instrument) for time in lasco_times]

# Display the query results
print("Query for SDO/AIA observations:")
print(aia_query)
print("Query for SDO/HMI observations:")
print(hmi_query)
for i, lasco_query in enumerate(lasco_queries, 1):
    print(f"Query for LASCO observation during eruption {i}:")
    print(lasco_query)

# Uncomment the lines below to download the data
# aia_files = Fido.fetch(aia_query)
# hmi_files = Fido.fetch(hmi_query)
# lasco_files = [Fido.fetch(query) for query in lasco_queries]
```

**Explanation**:
- **AIA and HMI Queries**: These queries cover the entire period from March 6 to March 10, 2012, as specified in the context. The AIA query includes a wavelength range that should be adjusted based on the specific channels used in the study (not detailed in the context).
- **LASCO Queries**: Separate queries are made for each specific time mentioned in the context when CMEs were observed following the eruptions. This ensures that the data retrieved corresponds exactly to the events of interest.
- **Output**: The script prints out the results of the queries. The actual downloading of the files is commented out to prevent unintentional data retrieval during testing or review.

This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the study as detailed in the context, focusing on the instruments and time periods that are most relevant.
