## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents a comparative study of X‐ray bursts emanating from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, focusing on bursts that occur with or without a fast radio burst (FRB) association. A key FRB event (FRB 200428) was accompanied by an X‐ray burst, and the analysis compares its timing, spectral, and energetic properties with a sample of 34 FRB-absent X‐ray bursts. Multiwavelength observational data from radio to gamma-/X-rays provided by several instruments (including FAST, Fermi/GBM, Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind) are used to probe the physical conditions of the magnetar episodes. Additional references to NICER, Swift/BAT, AGILE, and STARE-2 serve to place the study in the broader context of magnetar burst investigations and FRB energetics.
