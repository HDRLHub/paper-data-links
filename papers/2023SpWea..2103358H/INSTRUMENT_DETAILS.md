## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the identification and analysis of Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using observations from both L1 and off the Sun-Earth line. The primary data sources are the ESA/NASA SOHO and NASA STEREO spacecraft, specifically using instruments like LASCO on SOHO and the Heliospheric Imager (HI) and COR-2 on STEREO. The study covers the year 2011, a period of increased solar activity, providing a rich dataset for analysis. The main objective is to compare CME catalogues from L1 coronagraph imagery and off Sun-Earth line coronagraph and heliospheric imager observations to address inconsistencies in CME identification, which is crucial for accurate space weather forecasting. The findings highlight the importance of multiple vantage points for observing CMEs to improve the reliability of detecting Earth-directed events.

## Instrumentation Details

### LASCO on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) is used to observe CMEs from the L1 point, providing a direct view of phenomena as they head towards Earth.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of CMEs in 2011
- **Time Range**: January 2011 – December 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light
- **Physical Observable**: CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: LASCO consists of three coronagraphs, C1, C2, and C3, but only C2 and C3 have been operational since 1997, covering a field of view from 1.5 to 30 solar radii.

### SECCHI/COR-2 on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - The COR-2 coronagraphs are part of the SECCHI package on the twin STEREO spacecraft, providing imagery of CMEs from points off the Sun-Earth line.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of CMEs in 2011
- **Time Range**: January 2011 – December 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light
- **Physical Observable**: CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: COR-2 has a field of view from 2.5 to 15 solar radii, offering complete 360-degree coverage around the solar disc.

### SECCHI/HI on board STEREO
- **General Comments**:
   - The Heliospheric Imagers (HI-1 and HI-2) on STEREO are used to track CMEs through the inner solar system, providing a unique perspective on CME propagation from off the Sun-Earth line.

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations of CMEs in 2011
- **Time Range**: January 2011 – December 2011
- **Wavelength(s)**: Visible light
- **Physical Observable**: CMEs
- **Additional Comments**: HI-1 and HI-2 have fields of view of 20 degrees and 70 degrees respectively, allowing for continuous tracking of CMEs from 4 degrees to 88.7 degrees elongation near the ecliptic plane.
