## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper presents a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of the SOL2014-02-16T064600 solar flare (GOES class C1.5), involving simultaneous observations from a suite of space‐ and ground‐based instruments. The study uses hard X‐ray, soft X‐ray, UV, EUV, and microwave data—combined with 3D modeling—to probe the energy partition among thermal plasma heating, nonthermal electron acceleration, and plasma dynamics (both bulk and turbulent). Observations span different phases of the flare (pre-impulsive, impulsive, and main), and time intervals range from the early raster scan by IRIS starting at 06:16 UT until post-flare data past 06:56 UT, with specific temporal segments given by each instrument (e.g., RHESSI data from ~06:45 UT onward, IRIS’s 400-step scan from 06:16–07:19 UT, and microwave observations during the impulsive phase). The analysis emphasizes differences among three distinct flaring loops, where only one loop shows significant nonthermal electron signatures, and compares thermal and kinetic energy budgets derived from these observations.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
- **General Comments**:
   - RHESSI is used in the hard X-ray domain to study both thermal and nonthermal emissions in the solar flare. Although it missed the impulsive phase (due to orbital night), it captured the thermal response in the decay phase and provided high temporal (2 s) and energy (1 keV) resolution data using multiple detectors.
   - It also provided imaging (using the CLEAN algorithm) for energy bands between ∼3–25 keV.
