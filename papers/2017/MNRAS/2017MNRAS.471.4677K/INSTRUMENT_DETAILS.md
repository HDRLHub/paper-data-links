## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  The paper investigates the influence of solar flares on global modes of oscillations in the Sun by analyzing Sun-as-a-star, disk-integrated velocity and intensity data. The primary data sources are the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) and VIRGO/SPM (Variability of Solar IRradiance and Gravity / Sun PhotoMeter) instruments on board the SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) spacecraft. Observations span from 11 February 2011 (quiet day) to 17 February 2011, encompassing multiple flare events. An 8-hour window per day was selected for analysis, tailored to cover maximum flare activity, with 11 February 2011 serving as a null (quiet) comparison. The results are derived from direct analysis and spectral processing of GOLF velocity (Na I D lines, upper photosphere) and VIRGO/SPM intensity (862 nm, lower photosphere) data corresponding to these dates and times. Comparative analyses with quiet solar-minimum periods, and quantification of power enhancement in characteristic frequency intervals, underpin the findings.

## Instrumentation Details

### GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The GOLF instrument provided Sun-as-a-star, disk-integrated, line-of-sight velocity data using the Na I D lines, which are formed in the upper solar photosphere. Calibrated and processed data, rebinned to 60 s cadence, were used directly to analyze changes in global solar oscillation modes during flare events between 11 February 2011 and 17 February 2011, as well as for a solar-minimum comparison period in April 2007.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The GOLF instrument obtains Sun-as-a-star disk-integrated line-of-sight velocity observations using the Na I D lines with a 10 s cadence. However, we have used the calibrated velocity data from GOLF (García et al. 2005) rebinned for every 60 s to match with the VIRGO/SPM observations."

    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "We have analyzed the disk-integrated velocity and intensity observations of the Sun obtained from the GOLF and VIRGO/SPM instruments, respectively, on board the SOHO space mission covering several successive flare events, for the period from 11 February 2011 to 17 February 2011, of which 11 February 2011 remained a relatively quiet day and served as a 'null test' for the investigation."
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "We have chosen a time window of 8 hours on each day from 12 February 2011 to 17 February 2011 for our analysis in such a way that it covers the maximum number of flares on the given day. On contrary to this, the time window of 8 hours chosen on 11 February 2011 does not cover any flare events..."

    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "A high-pass filter has been applied to these data to reduce the signals from rotation and other slowly varying solar features with a cut-off established at three days."

    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "In order to test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the disk-integrated velocity observations obtained by the GOLF instrument for 8 hours of observations (08:00-16:00 UT) everyday during the period from 19 April 2007 to 23 April 2007 during the extended solar magnetic-activity minimum (Salabert et al. 2009)."

- **Additional Comments**: Used as an extended quiet baseline comparison for stochastic noise estimation.
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "This period during solar-activity minimum has no reported flares and thus can be used as another null-test period for our analysis."

### VIRGO/SPM (Variability of Solar IRradiance and Gravity / Sun PhotoMeter) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - The VIRGO/SPM instrument provided Sun-as-a-star, disk-integrated intensity data at three passbands (402 nm, 500 nm, 862 nm), of which the 862 nm (red) channel was specifically used for direct analysis. Data were matched to GOLF's cadence (60 s), corrected for orbital effects, and processed to investigate changes in global solar oscillation modes during flares across the dates 11 February 2011 to 17 February 2011.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The VIRGO/SPM instrument has basically three Sun photometers which obtain Sun-as-a-star disk-integrated intensity observations, separately, in the 5 nm spectral irradiance bands centered at 402 nm (blue), 500 nm (green), and 862 nm (red) with a 60 s cadence. We have used in our analysis the calibrated intensity data from VIRGO/SPM obtained at 862 nm..."

    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "Time series used in this work belong to a longer time series from which the interested days have been extracted to avoid the border effects of the aforementioned filter."

- **Additional Comments**: 
    - Data corrected for orbital motion, moving mean (triangular) filter and a two-point backward difference to remove low-frequency residuals.
    - **Supporting Quote**:  
      "These calibrated time series are first subjected to orbital corrections due to the satellite motion and then a 1-day moving mean filter with double smoothing (i.e., a triangular filter) is applied to reduce the signals from solar rotation and slow background variations. ... Finally, a two-point backward difference filter is applied to the time series to reduce the low-frequency residuals."
