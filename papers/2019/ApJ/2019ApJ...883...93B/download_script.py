This script uses sunpy's VSO client (Fido) to query SDO/HMI data.
We are using data available for the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). According to our study, we
require data from April 30, 2010 through March 13, 2019.
In this example, we specifically query data with the physical observable
"LOS_magnetic_field" and a wavelength near 6173 Ã…, consistent with the VSO interface.

# Define the source and instrument based on VSO interface for SDO/HMI data
source = a.Source("SDO")
instrument = a.Instrument("HMI")

# Choose the physical observable: LOS_magnetic_field (one of the available ones)
physobs = a.Physobs("LOS_magnetic_field")

# For HMI, the available wavelength range is 6173.0 - 6174.0 Angstrom.
wavelength = a.Wave(6173.0 * u.AA, 6174.0 * u.AA)

# Perform the query with explicit parameters.
# The query includes: time range, source, instrument, physobs type and wavelength.
result = Fido.search(time_range, source, instrument, physobs, wavelength)

# Print the query results to inspect available data.
print("Query Results:")
print(result)

# To fetch the data, you could uncomment the following command:
# files = Fido.fetch(result)
