```python

# Define the observation period as mentioned in the context
start_date = '1997-01-01'
end_date = '2018-12-31'

# Time range for the entire observation period
time_range = a.Time(start_date, end_date)

lasco_instrument = a.Instrument("LASCO")
detector_c2 = a.Detector("C2")  # C2 detector for LASCO
detector_c3 = a.Detector("C3")  # C3 detector for LASCO

# Construct queries for LASCO C2 and C3 detectors
# These queries will retrieve CME data for the specified period
lasco_c2_query = Fido.search(time_range, lasco_instrument, detector_c2)

# Display the query results for LASCO C2 and C3 detectors
print("Query for LASCO C2 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c2_query)
print("Query for LASCO C3 Detector Data:")
print(lasco_c3_query)

```

This script is tailored to the specific requirements of the context provided. It focuses on querying the SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 data for the entire period from 1997 to 2018, which is crucial for studying the orientation and propagation of CMEs as described in the summary of the paper. The script is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and directly addresses the needs outlined in the context.
