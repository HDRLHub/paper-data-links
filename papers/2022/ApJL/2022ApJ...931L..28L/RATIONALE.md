produce the script. We need to construct a query using the SunPy library to access data from the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO) for the RHESSI instrument. The context specifies that we are interested in data from July 23, 2002, between 00:25 UT and 00:33 UT. The RHESSI instrument provides data in the energy range of 3 keV to 17 MeV, and we are particularly interested in the energy bands of 50−100 keV, 100−300 keV, 300−500 keV, 700−1400 keV, and 2200−2300 keV. The VSO interface confirms that RHESSI data is available from February 12, 2002, to the present, which includes our date of interest. We will construct a query to retrieve this data, ensuring that we specify the time range and instrument as required. The script will print the query results, and the data fetching command will be commented out.

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a

# Define the time range for the data collection period
time_range = a.Time('2002-07-23 00:25', '2002-07-23 00:33')

# Define the instrument of interest
instrument = a.Instrument('rhessi')

# Construct the query
query = Fido.search(time_range, instrument)

# Print the query results
print(query)

# Uncomment the following line to fetch the data
# files = Fido.fetch(query)
```

This script sets up a query for RHESSI data within the specified time range. It uses the SunPy library's Fido interface to search for data in the VSO. The query results are printed, and the data fetching command is provided but commented out, as per the instructions.
