## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study investigates a long-duration GOES B9 flare event that occurred on 2011 May 11, associated with a quiescent filament eruption, global EUV wave, CME, and a piston-driven shock (type II radio burst). The event was extensively observed using multiple solar observation instruments, including SDO/AIA and HMI, NSO/GONG Hα, STEREO/COR1, SOHO/LASCO, and the HiRAS spectrograph. Observations spanned EUV, Hα, white light, and radio wavelengths, capturing the detailed temporal and spatial evolution of the flare and associated phenomena. Specific analysis periods include 2011 May 11, from around 02:00 UT to 04:00 UT, focusing on the flare, filament eruption, CME evolution, EUV wave propagation, and the radio shock signature.
