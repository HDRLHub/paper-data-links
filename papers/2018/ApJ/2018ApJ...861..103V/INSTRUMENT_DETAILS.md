## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates a class of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) known as streamer-blowout CMEs (SBOs). The authors identify 909 SBO events through white-light coronagraph observations and analyze their properties – including their durations, speeds, masses, kinetic energies, and morphologies – over an extended period spanning nearly two solar cycles. The study focuses on the gradual swelling and subsequent depletion of streamers, the occurrence rates, and the relationship of these events to the global dipolar magnetic field of the Sun. The primary data sources include observations from spaceborne coronagraphs on SOHO (LASCO/C2 and LASCO/C3), historical data from the Solwind coronagraph, radioheliograph data from Nobeyama, as well as surface magnetic field measurements from the Wilcox Solar Observatory. In addition, comparisons are made with prominence eruption observations from SDO/AIA. These various instruments and their respective observation periods are crucial for establishing the long-term solar cycle trends and the magnetic origins of SBOs.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. LASCO/C2 on board the SOHO Mission
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C2 is a white-light coronagraph instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). It played a central role in detecting and characterizing SBO events by capturing the evolution of the streamer swelling and subsequent depletion.
   - It provided high-sensitivity, high-cadence coronagraph images necessary to identify the subtle brightness changes associated with SBOs.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
   - “We identified 909 SBO events in the LASCO/C2 observations between 1996 and 2015.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Main SBO Observations
- **Time Range**: January 1996 – December 2015
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Our final list contains 909 SBOs observed from 1996 – 2015.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraph imaging)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Streamers and their cusps are best seen below 4-5 Rs in the LASCO C2 images.”
- **Physical Observable**: Changes in coronal brightness (streamer swelling and depletion) indicative of CME evolution.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The event sequence produces a characteristic ‘bugle’ signature in Carrington maps of the coronal brightness...”
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - The instrument’s cadence was originally 24 minutes, increased to 12 minutes since August 2010, which enabled finer measurement of the slow evolution of SBOs.

### 2. Solwind Coronagraph
- **General Comments**:
   - The Solwind coronagraph provided earlier observations of CMEs and was used in past studies for comparison with SBO characteristics.
   - It is referenced for its role in the statistical analysis of CME properties during a different solar activity period.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Howard et al. (1985, 1986) computed some properties of these events in their analysis of Solwind observations between 1979-1984.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Historical CME Observations
- **Time Range**: 1979 – 1984
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...their analysis of Solwind observations between 1979-1984.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraph imaging; exact band not specified)
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal brightness and mass measurements of CMEs.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied through comparison of parameters such as speed, width, and mass with the LASCO SBOs.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - Data from Solwind served as a benchmark to highlight differences in sensitivity and duty cycle compared to LASCO.

### 3. LASCO/C3 on board the SOHO Mission
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C3 is the outer-field coronagraph complementing C2 on SOHO. Its role in this study is primarily to measure the final speed of SBO events at the outer edges of the field of view, which is used in estimating kinetic energies.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “For speed, we use the final speed at the edge of the LASCO-C3 field, based on a 2nd degree fit.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Speed Measurements
- **Time Range**: 1996 – 2015 (inferred as part of the overall LASCO dataset)
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied throughout the text where the LASCO data are referenced for events observed between 1996 and 2015.
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light (coronagraph imaging)
- **Physical Observable**: CME propagation speeds (final speed at the edge of the C3 field) used to infer kinetic energy and related dynamic properties.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The final speed (top right panel) increases from 250 to 560 km/s between 1996 and 2000...”
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - Although not the primary instrument for SBO detection, C3 measurements complement C2 by providing dynamic speed estimates critical for full energy assessments.

### 4. Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)
- **General Comments**:
   - The Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) is a ground-based instrument used for radio observations of the Sun. In this study, it provides data on limb prominence eruptions, which are compared with SBO occurrences.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “The Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)... began observing limb prominence eruptions at 17 and 34 GHz in 1992.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence Eruption Observations
- **Time Range**: From 1992 onwards, with events compared over the same period as the LASCO observations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “Over the time period of the LASCO observations, we compared the NoRH list of PEs with our SBOs.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: 17 GHz and 34 GHz (radio frequencies)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...observing limb prominence eruptions at 17 and 34 GHz.”
- **Physical Observable**: Radio emissions from limb prominence eruptions, which serve as proxies for filament/prominence activity.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied in the discussion of prominence eruption occurrences.
- **Additional Comments**: 
   - NoRH data are used in conjunction with SBO position angles to investigate the association of SBO events with high-latitude (polar crown) prominence eruptions.

### 5. SDO/AIA (Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly)
- **General Comments**:
   - SDO/AIA is used as a complementary instrument to identify prominence eruptions (PEs) that are linked to SBO events. Its high-resolution extreme ultraviolet observations help confirm associations during particular phases.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “Independently we compared the SBO list in 2011 with a list of SDO/AIA PEs.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: Prominence Eruption Association in 2011
- **Time Range**: 2011 (specific to the comparison with the SBO list)
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...of the 60 SBOs in 2011 ~23 PEs were associated.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Extreme Ultraviolet (specific channels not detailed in the text)
- **Physical Observable**: Detection of prominence eruptions, providing further evidence of SBO origins from extended polarity inversion lines.
   - **Supporting Quote**: Implied through the association analysis between SBOs and prominence eruptions.
- **Additional Comments**:
   - Although discussed only for a sample year, SDO/AIA data play a supportive role in confirming the magnetic origins of SBO events.

### 6. Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) Magnetograms
- **General Comments**:
   - The Wilcox Solar Observatory provides magnetogram data that are used to compute the tilt angle of the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS). This information is important to relate the SBO properties, such as event duration and central position angle, to the global dipolar magnetic field structure.
- **Supporting Quote**:
   - “We obtain the ‘tilt angle’ of the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) from the Wilcox Solar Observatory magnetograms.”
- 
#### Data Collection Period 1: HCS Tilt Angle Computation
- **Time Range**: The magnetograms span the same period as the LASCO observations (1996 – 2015 is inferred) since yearly averages are compared over these years.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “...the maps... extend to Carrington rotation 2168 (Sep-Oct 2015) as of this writing.”
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetograms are based on line-of-sight magnetic field measurements rather than traditional wavelengths)
- **Physical Observable**: The HCS tilt (indicative of the orientation of the global solar magnetic field), which is compared with SBO central position angles and durations.
   - **Supporting Quote**: “The correspondence between the two quantities is obvious... the SBO-CME locations follow the HCS tilt.”
- **Additional Comments**:
   - WSO data aid in establishing the connection between the magnetic field configuration and the physical properties of SBO events.
