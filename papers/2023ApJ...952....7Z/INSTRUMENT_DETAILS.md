## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper investigates the radial expansion of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by combining remote and in-situ observations. The study focuses on 22 CME events from 2010 to 2013, observed by coronagraphs and spacecraft in radial conjunction. Using the graduated cylindrical shell model, the paper estimates the radial size, expansion speed, and dimensionless expansion parameter of CMEs in the corona. These parameters are compared with in-situ measurements of radial size increase and magnetic field strength decrease. The study finds inconsistencies between the CME radial sizes estimated by remote observations and those estimated in-situ, discusses the correlations of expansion parameters, and explores the reasons for these discrepancies and their implications for space weather forecasting.
