## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the rotation and non-radial motion of a coronal mass ejection (CME) flux rope from AR 12468, which erupted on 2015 December 16 and subsequently caused an intense geomagnetic storm. The research objectives include characterizing the eruption at the Sun, reconstructing the CME’s magnetic structure in the corona and near-Earth environment, and correlating the CME characteristics with geomagnetic impacts. The study utilizes direct observations from the following instruments: SDO’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging, SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) for vector magnetograms, SOHO’s LASCO coronagraphs for white-light CME tracking, STEREO A’s COR2 coronagraph for additional white-light imaging, and in situ solar wind and magnetic field measurements from the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU. The data from these instruments, covering both pre-eruption and post-eruption phases (with specific attention to December 16–20, 2015), are central to identifying the CME’s source, modeling its coronal evolution, tracking its interplanetary journey, and reconstructing its flux rope structure at Earth.
