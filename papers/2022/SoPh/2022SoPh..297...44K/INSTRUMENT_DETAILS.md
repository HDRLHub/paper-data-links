## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper presents observations of three sympathetic filament eruptions (F1, F2, and F3) that occurred on 19 July 2015. These events were observed using various instruments, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) telescope in Hα line, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO, and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the SOHO satellite. The study focuses on the dynamics and kinematics of these eruptions, their association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the role of magnetic flux emergence and cancellation in triggering these eruptions.
