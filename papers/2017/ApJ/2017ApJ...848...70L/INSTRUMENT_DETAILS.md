## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper addresses the "Open Flux Problem"—the discrepancy between the open magnetic flux of the Sun as inferred from models constrained by solar observations and that inferred from in situ spacecraft data at 1 AU. The study focuses on Carrington Rotation 2098 (June 16 – July 13, 2010, with particular emphasis on July 7–8, 2010), using magnetic field maps created from several different ground- and space-based solar magnetographs, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data from both SDO and STEREO spacecraft. These maps serve as boundary conditions for potential field source surface (PFSS) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. Coronal holes are detected and quantified using automatically processed EUV image data. In situ measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field for this period are used for comparison, primarily using OMNI dataset (which collects data from various near-Earth spacecraft, especially ACE and Wind). The data collected from solar imagers and in situ instruments forms the basis for boundary constructions, model constraints, and comparative analysis, providing direct links between instrumentation, data acquisition periods, and the research conclusions.

Because of the weighting, the weighted EUV/CH map data originates mostly from the AIA instrument but, due to the nature of the merged synchronic maps, there is some contribution from STEREO A/B data near the polar regions that are unobserved by AIA."
