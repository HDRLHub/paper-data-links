## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper investigates the interplanetary and geomagnetic consequences of two interacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) launched on 13 and 14 June 2012 from the same active region (NOAA AR 11504). It uses multi-spacecraft observations to track and reconstruct the 3D kinematics of the CMEs from their initiation in the low corona to their in situ detection near Earth. The study utilizes imaging data from space‐borne coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (SECCHI suite on the twin STEREO spacecraft and LASCO on SOHO) as well as in situ measurements from Wind and ACE. Detailed time ranges—from the early occurrence of CMEs (13–14 June 2012) to the collision phase (15 June 2012, 8:40 UT to 15:50 UT) and the in situ time window (16–18 June 2012)—are provided to link the remote imaging with the in situ response, including a rare, strong sudden storm commencement (SSC) with a peak of ≈150 nT in Solar Cycle 24.
