## Summary of the Paper

- **Content Summary**:  
  This paper investigates the coronal deflection and rotation of 45 Earth-impacting coronal mass ejections (CMEs) occurring between November 2007 and June 2014, spanning the late declining phase of Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Solar Cycle 24. The research leverages multi-spacecraft coronagraph and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, as well as in situ magnetic field measurements near Earth. The primary data sources are coronagraph images from STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO/LASCO, EUV imagery from SOHO/EIT, SDO/AIA, and STEREO/EUVI, magnetograms from SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI, and in situ plasma and magnetic field data from ACE and Wind. The study reconstructs the coronal position and orientation of each CME using the GCS model, simulates their evolution with ForeCAT, and compares model predictions to near-Earth magnetic field profiles observed by ACE and Wind. The integrity of the findings relies on the direct analysis of these remote-sensing and in situ datasets across the specified period.

### COR1 and COR2 Coronagraphs on board STEREO-A and STEREO-B

- **General Comments**:
  - STEREO-A and STEREO-B COR1 and COR2 coronagraph images were used for 3D reconstruction of each CME's position and orientation using the GCS model. Both viewpoints were simultaneously employed to visually fit CME shapes and determine their coronal trajectories.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Finally, we exclude any CMEs that do not have at least COR2 coronagraph observations from both STEREO spacecraft, yielding a final set of 45 CMEs between November 2007 and June 2014, occurring between the late declining phase of Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of the maximum of Solar Cycle 24."
  

#### Data Collection Period 1: 45 Earth-impacting CMEs

### LASCO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) on board SOHO

- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO was used to identify CME counterparts to in situ ICMEs and to obtain coronal velocities and mass estimates.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
    "To select the CMEs in this paper, we begin with the Richardson and Cane [2010] list of near-Earth ICMEs... we select only the ICMEs that have an identified LASCO coronal CME counterpart within the list."
  

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME identification, velocity, and mass assessment

- **Time Range**: November 2007 – June 2014; event-specific (corresponding to listed 45 events)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "This set includes ICMEs that satisfy the criteria to qualify as magnetic clouds (MCs, Burlaga et al. [1981]) and more complicated or less clear structures that would be classified as non-MCs or ejecta."

### EUV Imagers: SOHO/EIT, SDO/AIA, STEREO/EUVI

- **General Comments**:
  - Extreme ultraviolet imagers from SOHO, SDO, and STEREO were employed to determine CME source regions, eruption locations, and to identify post-eruption arcades and filaments.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We determine an approximate initial location using observations from a combination of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers to determine whether each CME erupts from an active region and, if so, which part of the active region erupts. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT 195 Å) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SOHO/AIA 171 Å or 193 Å) tend to provide a face on view of the post-eruption arcade and the STEREO Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI 195 Å) can show the location of filaments off the solar limb for many of these Earth-directed CMEs."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME source region identification

- **Time Range**: November 2007 – June 2014; individual events' eruption times (up to several hours before COR1/COR2 appearance)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We determine an approximate initial location using observations from a combination of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers... The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT 195 Å) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SOHO/AIA 171 Å or 193 Å) tend to provide a face on view of the post-eruption arcade and the STEREO Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI 195 Å) can show the location of filaments off the solar limb for many of these Earth-directed CMEs."
- **Wavelength(s)**: 195 Å (SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI); 171 Å and 193 Å (SDO/AIA)

    "SOHO/EIT 195 Å) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SOHO/AIA 171 Å or 193 Å)"
- **Physical Observable**: CME initiation location, post-eruption arcades, and solar disk/limb context for source regions
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We determine an approximate initial location using observations from a combination of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers to determine whether each CME erupts from an active region and, if so, which part of the active region erupts... STEREO Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI 195 Å) can show the location of filaments off the solar limb for many of these Earth-directed CMEs."

### SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI Magnetographs

- **General Comments**:
  - SDO/HMI magnetograms (post-May 2010) and SOHO/MDI magnetograms (pre-May 2010) were used to identify polarity inversion lines and the magnetic context for CME source regions.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We combine this approximate location with an SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram (or SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetogram for CMEs before May 2010) to determine the polarity inversion line from which each CME erupts, yielding a better approximation to the initial latitude, longitude, and orientation of each CME."

#### Data Collection Period 1: CME source region magnetic mapping

- **Time Range**:  
    - SOHO/MDI: November 2007 – May 2010  
    - SDO/HMI: May 2010 – June 2014  
    (for each corresponding CME event)
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram (or SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetogram for CMEs before May 2010)"
- **Wavelength(s)**:  
    - HMI: 6173 Å (Fe I)  
    - MDI: 6768 Å (Ni I)  
    - (Wavelengths not explicitly quoted, but implied by the referenced instrument names)
- **Physical Observable**: Surface line-of-sight magnetic field for source polarity determination
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "to determine the polarity inversion line from which each CME erupts, yielding a better approximation to the initial latitude, longitude, and orientation of each CME."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - HMI used post-2010, MDI used before SDO’s launch.

### ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) – MAG and SWEPAM, Wind – MFI and SWE

- **General Comments**:
  - The in situ plasma and magnetic field observations by ACE and Wind spacecraft were directly analyzed for near-Earth CMEs. These datasets were used to compare model predictions (FIDO) to observed magnetic field profiles, and to define ICME/flux rope boundaries.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Near 1 AU we consider in situ data from both ACE and Wind. Many of the ICMEs within the RC ICME list are also identified in the Wind ICME list... When comparing with the in situ data, we tend to use the most conservative set of boundaries, which may combine times from the two different lists."
  

#### Data Collection Period 1: ICME in situ magnetic field analysis

- **Time Range**: November 2007 – June 2014; for each specific CME, the event’s interval defined by the RC ICME list and Wind ICME list
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "...yielding a final set of 45 CMEs between November 2007 and June 2014... Near 1 AU we consider in situ data from both ACE and Wind... Both lists contain start and stop times for each CME, and these two independent measurements are often not in agreement despite the magnetic field not varying significantly between spacecraft."
- **Wavelength(s)**: Not applicable (magnetic field and plasma parameters)
- **Physical Observable**: In situ magnetic field (Bx, By, Bz in GSE), total magnetic field magnitude, and plasma parameters during ICME passage
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "We assume no evolution between the outer corona and 1 AU and use the ForeCAT results to drive the FIDO in situ magnetic field model [Kay et al., 2017a], allowing for comparisons with ACE and Wind observations."
- **Additional Comments**:
  - Magnetic field and plasma data are the basis for goodness-of-fit scoring of simulation outputs.

### FIDO (ForeCAT In situ Data Observer) Model Inputs – Sourced from Instrument Data

- **General Comments**:
  - FIDO is a model, not an instrument, but it is *directly driven* by inputs from the above processed instrument data (GCS reconstructions, in situ boundary times, and magnetic field strength scaling). Model results are systematically compared with ACE and Wind observations.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
    "FIDO uses the CME position and tilt from ForeCAT to orient a CME flux rope. FIDO propagates the flux rope past a synthetic spacecraft, determining the spacecraft’s distance from the toroidal axis and the orientation of the CME’s toroidal and poloidal directions as a function of time... allowing for direct comparison to the ACE and Wind data."
