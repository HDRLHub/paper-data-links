produce the script. We need to construct a Python script using the SunPy library to query solar radio data from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) for the specific date and time range mentioned in the context. The script will focus on retrieving data between 30-70 MHz, which is crucial for analyzing the radio spikes and Type IIIb striae associated with the CME. Given the specific requirements, we will:

1. Define the time range and frequency band as specified in the context.
2. Use the `Fido` interface from SunPy, which is capable of handling complex queries for solar data.
3. Since the VSO interface does not explicitly list LOFAR, we will assume it's available or simulate the query setup for educational purposes.
4. Print the query results to verify the correct setup and provide commented out `Fido.fetch` commands for potential data retrieval.
