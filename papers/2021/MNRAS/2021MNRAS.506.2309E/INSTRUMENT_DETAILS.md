1. Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Magnetographs  
   - **General Comments**:  
     These instruments are the backbone for the solar magnetograms utilized in the solar wind models described in the paper. The GONG network is a ground‐based system operated by the National Solar Observatory and is composed of identical telescopes deployed at several observatories (Big Bear Solar Observatory, High Altitude Observatory, Learmonth Solar Observatory, Udaipur Solar Observatory, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory).  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “This work utilises data obtained by the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Program, managed by the National Solar Observatory, which is operated by AURA, Inc. under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. The data were acquired by instruments operated by Big Bear Solar Observatory, High Altitude Observatory, Learmonth Solar Observatory, Udaipur Solar Observatory, Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.”  
   - **Data Collection Period(s)**:  
     a. Solar Maximum Mode:  
        - **Time Range**: Carrington Rotation 2157 – corresponding to November 2014  
        - **Supporting Quote**:  
          “...the magnetograms from Carrington Rotation 2157 (Solar maximum, November 2014)...”  
     b. Solar Minimum Mode:  
        - **Time Range**: Carrington Rotation 2211 – corresponding to December 2018  
        - **Supporting Quote**:  
          “...and Carrington Rotation 2211 (Solar minimum, December 2018).”  
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observables**:  
     The GONG instruments are designed to record full‐disk solar observations in visible light (typically using Doppler and magnetographic techniques) to extract photospheric magnetic field maps. Although the precise spectral band is not detailed in this excerpt, such instruments generally operate with narrowband filters tuned to, for example, the Ni I 6768 Å spectral line. The primary physical observable is the line-of-sight (radial) magnetic field strength.

2. SOHO/MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     The SOHO/MDI instrument is mentioned as a reference for cross-calibration of the solar surface magnetic field measurements. Its magnetograms are used (in comparison) for estimating surface |B| values in Solar wind models.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “For their Solar models we estimate the surface |B| values from SOHO/MDI magnetograms truncated to 120 G…”  
   - **Data Collection Period**:  
     No specific start and end times are provided in the context; only that these magnetograms (from the SOHO/MDI instrument) serve as a reference point for Solar observations.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observables**:  
     SOHO/MDI is a spaceborne instrument operating in visible wavelengths (using the Michelson interferometer technique) that provides full-disk photospheric Dopplergrams and magnetograms. The primary observables include Doppler shifts and polarized light signals measuring the magnetic field.

3. Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)  
   - **General Comments**:  
     The HMI instrument is referenced as an additional source of vector magnetic field data for the Sun. It is part of the suite of instruments that have provided high-resolution magnetic maps for solar studies.  
   - **Supporting Quote**:  
     “Vector magnetograms of the Sun have been available with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Pesnell et al. 2012; Hoeksema et al. 2014)...”  
   - **Data Collection Period**:  
     The context does not list explicit observation dates or time ranges for HMI data. It is understood that HMI has been operational since shortly after its launch on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in February 2010.
   - **Wavelength(s) / Detectors / Physical Observables**:  
     HMI observes the Sun in the visible continuum with a narrowband filter centered on the Fe I 6173 Å line. It utilizes CCD detectors and provides both Dopplergrams and full vector magnetic field measurements—key observables for understanding solar magnetic activity.
