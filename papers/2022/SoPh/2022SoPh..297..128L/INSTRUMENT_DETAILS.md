## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: The paper focuses on the extraction of heliographic coordinates of coronal rays using images from the Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The study involves observations made during PSP's seventh orbit in January 2021, when the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) near perihelion. The WISPR instrument captured images of the solar wind and coronal rays, which were analyzed to determine their 3D locations. The technique developed was validated by comparing the results with observations from the Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO) / Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO)/C3 and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A/COR2. The findings aim to help validate dynamic models of the corona.

## Instrumentation Details

### Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
- **General Comments**:
   - WISPR captures white-light images of the corona from a unique vantage point inside the orbit of Mercury. It observes sunlight Thomson-scattered by electrons in the corona, providing a weighted measure of the integrated electron density along the line of sight.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The Wide-ﬁeld Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR: Vourlidas et al., 2016) onboard the Parker Solar Probe (PSP: Fox et al., 2016) is returning white-light images of the corona from its unprecedented vantage point inside the orbit of Mercury."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Observations near perihelion during the seventh orbit
- **Time Range**: January 17, 2021 – January 18, 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "During the seventh orbit, PSP went deeper into the corona (rp= 20.4 Rsun at 2021-01-17T17:37), and the inner edge of WISPR’s ﬁeld-of-view, at an elongation of 13.5◦, could reach as close to the Sun as 5 Rsun."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "White light coronagraphs observe sunlight Thomson-scattered by the electrons in the corona."
- **Physical Observable**: Integrated electron density along the line of sight
   - **Supporting Quote**: "A coronagraph image records the integrated Thomson-scattered signal from all the electrons along the line of sight and thus is weighted measure of the integrated electron density along the line of sight (Vourlidas and Howard, 2006)."
- **Additional Comments**: The observations were made as PSP crossed the HCS, providing views of the streamer belt from within. The rapid change in apparent latitude of the rays provided information on their 3D location relative to PSP.

### Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO)/C3 onboard Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO)
- **General Comments**:
   - LASCO/C3 provides synoptic white-light images of the corona, which were used to validate the coordinates of the coronal rays determined from WISPR images.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The technique was validated by comparing the results to observations of the coronal rays from Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO) / Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO)/C3 and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A/COR2."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Validation of coronal ray coordinates
- **Time Range**: January 17, 2021 – January 18, 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "We compared the locations of the rays to the LASCO/C3 synoptic white light maps for this time period."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The synoptic C3 maps are created in a manner analogous to creating synoptic magnetograms, but here the data at a ﬁxed radius on the west limb in the coronagraph image is collected for each day, converted to a strip and the strips stacked in time/Carrington longitude to create the Carrington synoptic map."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal ray locations and their comparison with synoptic maps
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The locations of both solutions for all four features fall on the bands of brightness seen by LASCO/C3, indicating that coronal rays were present at those latitudes and longitudes when viewed by LASCO at the time on the top axis."
- **Additional Comments**: The LASCO/C3 observations provided a different vantage point from 1 AU, helping to validate the 3D locations of the coronal rays determined from WISPR images.

### COR2 onboard Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A
- **General Comments**:
   - COR2 provides white-light images of the corona from a different vantage point, which were used to validate the coordinates of the coronal rays determined from WISPR images.
- **Supporting Quote**: "The technique was validated by comparing the results to observations of the coronal rays from Solar and Heliophysics Observatory (SOHO) / Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO)/C3 and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A/COR2."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Validation of coronal ray coordinates
- **Time Range**: January 17, 2021 – January 18, 2021
   - **Supporting Quote**: "More detailed comparisons were made with single images from LASCO/C3 and COR2A."
- **Wavelength(s)**: White light
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The bright curved feature is a comet tail. Note that the radial extent of the segments shown in Figure 11 do not correspond to the radial extent seen and tracked in the WISPR images (only WIS-I Low Ray extended into 10 Rsun)."
- **Physical Observable**: Coronal ray locations and their comparison with images
   - **Supporting Quote**: "The good agreement with the rays seen in the COR2A and LASCO/C3 images increase our conﬁdence in the technique, since we expect the coronal rays to fall within the coronal plasma sheets observed by these coronagraphs."
- **Additional Comments**: The COR2A observations provided a different vantage point from STEREO-A, helping to validate the 3D locations of the coronal rays determined from WISPR images.
