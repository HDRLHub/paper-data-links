**produce the script**. We need to construct queries for the Kepler Space Telescope and the VIRGO instrument on SOHO based on the context provided. The context specifies the use of these instruments for scientific observations related to asteroseismology and solar photometric measurements. Given the details:

1. **Kepler Space Telescope**:
   - **Time Range**: 2009 to 2013 (full operational period of Kepler).
   - **Physical Observable**: Photometric brightness variations.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: Broad visual bandpass (not specifically defined in angstroms).

2. **VIRGO Instrument on SOHO**:
   - **Time Range**: Data spanning multiple years, operational since 1996.
   - **Wavelength(s)**: 402 nm, 500 nm, 862 nm.
   - **Physical Observable**: Solar photometric brightness.

We will create queries for these instruments using the SunPy library. Note that while Kepler data might not be directly accessible via SunPy's Fido, we will focus on constructing the query for VIRGO as it is listed in the VSO interface.

**Script**:

```python
from sunpy.net import Fido, attrs as a
from astropy import units as u

# VIRGO/SOHO: Solar photometric brightness measurements
# Time range: Not specific, let's assume a broad range for demonstration
virgo_start_date = '1996-01-01'
virgo_end_date = '2013-12-31'
virgo_time_range = a.Time(virgo_start_date, virgo_end_date)

# VIRGO instrument details from VSO interface
virgo_instrument = a.Instrument("VIRGO")
virgo_wavelengths = [a.Wavelength(402 * u.nm), a.Wavelength(500 * u.nm), a.Wavelength(862 * u.nm)]

# Constructing the query for VIRGO
virgo_query = Fido.search(virgo_time_range, virgo_instrument, *virgo_wavelengths)

# Display the query results for VIRGO
print("Query for VIRGO photometric brightness measurements:")
print(virgo_query)

# Uncomment the line below to download the data
# virgo_files = Fido.fetch(virgo_query)
```

**Explanation**:
- The script constructs a query for the VIRGO instrument on SOHO using the SunPy library. The query specifies a time range from 1996 to 2013, covering a broad operational period.
- The wavelengths specified are based on the details provided in the context, which mentions VIRGO's three channels.
- The `Fido.search` function is used to search for data matching the specified criteria. The results are printed, and the actual data download command is commented out as per the directive.

This script reflects the data used in the context and adheres strictly to the provided details. It is designed to be clear, explicit, and avoids complex structures for easy understanding and modification.
