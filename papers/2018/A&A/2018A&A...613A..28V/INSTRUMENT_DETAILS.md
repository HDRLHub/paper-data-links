## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**:  
  This study proposes a new source spectrum for Jovian electrons based on direct in situ spacecraft measurements collected over 30 years. The research centers on using data from flybys close to the Jovian magnetosphere—specifically from Pioneer 10's Charged Particle Instrument (CPI) and Ulysses' Kiel Electron Telescope (COSPIN-KET)—to derive and fit the electron source spectrum. Measurements obtained at Earth's orbit, such as those from SOHO/EPHIN, Ulysses/KET, and ISEE 3 (ICE) Chicago electron spectrometer, are used for cross-checking consistency of the proposed source, but not for deriving it directly. The paper provides explicit details about observation periods, energy/wavelength ranges, and physical observables pertinent to Jovian electrons in the inner heliosphere, with all results hinging on data directly analyzed from the specified instruments.

### Charged Particle Instrument (CPI) on board Pioneer 10
- **General Comments**:
  - Pioneer 10 CPI provided key energetic electron measurements during its flyby of Jupiter, forming one of the direct datasets used to derive the new Jovian electron source spectrum. Specific fluxes from daily counting rates, especially during identified "Jovian jet" events and quiet-time background, were analyzed.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "Figure 1 shows energy spectra obtained outside of Jupiter’s magnetosphere during the Pioneer 10 and Ulysses flybys (for details, see Table 1). ... The Pioneer 10 spectrum is shown both with and without the renormalization illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in Sect. 3.1."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Jupiter Flyby, focus on Jovian electron jets vs. quiet time
- **Time Range**:  
  "measurements obtained on 11 May 1973, a day with extraordinary high fluxes."  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Teegarden et al. (1974) determined their energy spectrum from measurements obtained on 11 May 1973, a day with extraordinary high fluxes."
- **Wavelength(s)/Energies**:  
  "7–17 MeV electron channel"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Fig. 2. Pioneer 10’s CPI counting rates of the 7–17 MeV electron channel (blue), are displayed together with the result of an exponential background fit (black with a gray shaded region showing a 1 σ uncertainty)."
- **Physical Observable**:  
  Counting rate increases of MeV electrons, specifically identification of "Jovian electron jets" and quiet-time flux background  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "A short-duration increase in the electron flux is observed together with a significant anisotropy and a local interplanetary magnetic field aligned to the direction toward Jupiter. Furthermore, the spectral slope is the same as the one observed inside the Jovian magnetosphere."

- **Additional Comments**:  
  - Assessments and normalization of this dataset were fundamental to reconciling differences between Pioneer 10 and later instruments' measured electron fluxes.

### Kiel Electron Telescope (COSPIN-KET) on board Ulysses
- **General Comments**:
  - Ulysses COSPIN-KET produced long-term in situ electron measurements, including energy spectra near the time of the first Jupiter encounter and during cruise near Earth's orbit. Data from both contexts were critically used to fit and cross-validate the Jovian electron source spectrum.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "The COsmic and Solar Particle INvestigation Kiel Electron Telescope (COSPIN-KET) on board Ulysses measured electron counting rates in three energy channels during the entire mission from October 1990 until June 2009. Using a detailed data analysis utilizing GEANT 3 simulations Heber et al. (2005) could provide two electron spectra: one measured in the early cruise phase still near Earth’s orbit and a second one capturing the electron fluxes during the first Jupiter encounter in February 1992."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Jupiter Encounter – In situ measurements near Jovian magnetosphere
- **Time Range**:  
  "during the first Jupiter encounter in February 1992"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "a second one capturing the electron fluxes during the first Jupiter encounter in February 1992."
- **Wavelength(s)/Energies**:  
  "electron counting rates in three energy channels"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "measured electron counting rates in three energy channels during the entire mission from October 1990 until June 2009."
- **Physical Observable**:  
  Energy spectra of MeV electrons near Jupiter
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Both COSPIN-KET spectra are consistent with spectra obtained by the Voyager 1 BSe detector, for equivalent energies both at the Earth and for the Jupiter encounter in 1977."

- **Additional Comments**:  
  - This flyby spectrum was one of only two principal in situ measurements used to derive the new Jovian source spectrum.

#### Data Collection Period 2: Cruise Phase – Reference measurements near Earth’s orbit
- **Time Range**:  
  "the early cruise phase still near Earth’s orbit"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "one measured in the early cruise phase still near Earth’s orbit"

### Electron Proton Helium INstrument (EPHIN) on board SOHO
- **General Comments**:
  - SOHO/EPHIN electron spectral data at Earth were used to validate, not derive, the new Jovian source spectrum. Electron spectra from time intervals of good magnetic connectivity with Jupiter were analyzed.
- **Supporting Quote**:  
  "the electron spectral data of SOHO-SEPT cover roughly the same energy range in more detail as the flyby data by Pioneer 10. As described by Kühl et al. (2013) two electron spectra were derived from SOHO-EPHIN (Müller-Mellin et al. 1995) data to investigate the effect of parallel and perpendicular diffusive transport on Jovian electron fluxes."

#### Data Collection Period 1: Earth Orbit – Validation spectra during undisturbed magnetic connection
- **Time Range**:  
  "time periods of undisturbed magnetospheric conditions between Jupiter and the spacecraft, as well as an (assumed) magnetic connection"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "we chose the spectrum which corresponds to time periods of undisturbed magnetospheric conditions between Jupiter and the spacecraft, as well as an (assumed) magnetic connection."
- **Wavelength(s)/Energies**:  
  "in the corresponding energy range show an unexplained spectral break at 0.5 MeV"  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "the SOHO-EPHIN data at the corresponding energy range show an unexplained spectral break at 0.5 MeV"
- **Physical Observable**:  
  Energy-resolved electron spectra at 1 AU for cross-checking model results
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "Electron spectra at the Earth’s orbit will not be used in this study to obtain a Jovian source spectrum. The more detailed measurements at 1 AU are however important in order to validate our findings."

- **Additional Comments**:  
  - These data were used solely for cross-validation of the spectrum determined from flyby measurements.

### Chicago Electron Spectrometer on board ISEE 3 (ICE)
- **General Comments**:
  - ISEE 3 Chicago electron spectrometer data were used at Earth’s orbit, focusing on periods of maximum magnetic connectivity to Jupiter, to cross-validate the derived Jovian electron source spectrum.

- **Physical Observable**:  
  Energy-resolved electron flux at 1 AU during presumed connection to Jovian source  
  - **Supporting Quote**:  
    "The variations in the different energy channels are due to the long averaging periods in connection with the variability of both the connectivity and the solar activity during that time, although flares identified by IMP 8 were excluded."

**Note: Voyager 1 BSe detector is mentioned as providing data for comparison and evaluation but is NOT shown to be directly analyzed, processed, or used as a primary source for results in this paper. Data from Galileo, Cassini, and Juno energetic particle instruments are explicitly stated as not used due to lack of suitable published flyby spectra.**
