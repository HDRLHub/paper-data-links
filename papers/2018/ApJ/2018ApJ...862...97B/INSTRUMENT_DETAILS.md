## Summary of the Paper
- **Content Summary**: This paper reports on solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by the PAMELA mission between 2006 and 2014. It focuses on measuring and modeling the energy spectra of SEPs—from tens of MeV up to a few GeV—using high-precision space‐borne observations. The study uses data collected by PAMELA’s integrated detector systems to derive spectral features such as power laws with exponential rollovers and compares these results with complementary measurements from ground‐based neutron monitors and imaging observations (e.g. from STEREO and SOHO) of associated solar eruptions. The detailed timing of SEP events (with start and stop times determined by 48‐minute data bins) is critical in correlating in situ particle measurements with remote sensing of flares and CMEs.

## Instrumentation Details

### 1. PAMELA on board Resurs-DK1 Satellite
- **General Comments**:
  - PAMELA (Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) is a space-borne experiment designed for precise measurements of charged cosmic rays – protons, electrons, their antiparticles, and light nuclei.
  - It features multiple detector subsystems including a magnetic spectrometer with a silicon tracking system, a time-of-flight system shielded by an anticoincidence system, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a neutron detector.
  - The instrument’s high sensitivity allows it to bridge the gap between the low-energy in situ spacecraft observations and the high-energy ground-based neutron monitors.
- **Supporting Quote**: 
  - "Thanks to its unique observational capabilities, the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) mission provides accurate and detailed SEP measurements in a wide energy range, bridging the gap between the low-energy observations of in-situ space-based instruments and GLE data from the worldwide network of NMs." (Section 1 and 2)
  
#### Data Collection Period 1: Primary SEP Observations
- **Time Range**: 
  - PAMELA was launched on 2006 June 15 into a semi-polar, elliptical orbit (350–610 km altitude); in 2010 it was transitioned into a nearly circular orbit at ∼580 km altitude. The SEP events discussed in the paper were recorded between 2006 July and 2014 September.
  - Additionally, it is mentioned that PAMELA operated until the loss of contact in January 2016.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The Resurs-DK1 satellite, which hosts the apparatus, was launched ... on 2006 June 15; in 2010 it was moved to an approximately circular orbit at an altitude of ∼580 km. It operated up until the loss of contact in 2016 January." (Section 2)
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not applicable; PAMELA measures charged particle energies rather than electromagnetic wavelengths.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Proton intensities, energy spectra (from ∼80 MeV to several GeV), spectral indices, and high-energy rollovers.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The instrument implemented a 48-minute time resolution corresponding to its semi-orbit duration. Its onboard detector systems allowed comprehensive measurements of SEP events and contributed crucial data for studying particle acceleration and transport.

### 2. Ground-based Neutron Monitors (NMs)
- **General Comments**:
  - Neutron monitors are ground-based detectors that sense the secondary atmospheric neutrons produced when high-energy solar particles (especially from ground-level enhancements or GLEs) interact with the Earth’s atmosphere.
  - They provide complementary data to space-borne measurements, especially for particles in the GeV energy range.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The most energetic SEP events induce atmospheric showers whose secondary products can be detected by ground-based detectors such as neutron monitors (NMs)..." (Introduction)
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - While no specific operational dates are provided in the paper, these ground-based detectors work continuously. In this study, they provide context for distinguishing GLE and sub-GLE events during the SEP events recorded by PAMELA.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - Not applicable; these instruments measure secondary particle counts resulting from high-energy interactions.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Count rates of secondary neutrons, which are used to infer the presence and intensity of high-energy solar protons.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - The South Pole Neutron Monitor (SPNM) is specifically mentioned as the instrument that unambiguously detected a candidate sub-GLE event.
  - "The two GLEs... were both detected by PAMELA. ... in this work we classify as “sub-GLEs” the events unambiguously detected by only one NM: the South Pole station (hereafter SPNM) at a 2820 m altitude." (Section 2.2)

### 3. STEREO/EUVI (Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board the STEREO Spacecraft)
- **General Comments**:
  - EUVI is used to provide observational estimates of flare sizes for events occurring on the far side of the Sun. It allows researchers to infer flare properties when direct observations (e.g. soft X-rays) from Earth-orbiting platforms are not available.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "In the case of events originating on the far side of the Sun, the flare size is estimated from observations made by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft..." (Section 2.2)
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - Specific dates are not detailed in the paper for EUVI observations; however, they are implicitly contemporaneous with the SEP events studied (2006–2014).
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - EUV wavelengths (extreme ultraviolet light); exact channels are not specified.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Flare size and associated extreme ultraviolet emissions.
- **Additional Comments**:
  - EUVI observations are particularly critical for characterizing the flare properties of events on the far side, supplementing in situ and Earth-based X-ray measurements.

### 4. LASCO on board SOHO (Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph)
- **General Comments**:
  - LASCO is a coronagraph instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) used to observe and characterize coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It provides key data on CME first appearance times, sky-plane speeds, and angular widths.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "...the parent CME first appearance times, sky-plane speeds and angular widths from the CDAW catalog of the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)..." (Section 2.2)
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - The paper does not specify a time range for LASCO operations; however, the LASCO data referenced overlaps with the PAMELA observation period of SEP events (2006–2014).
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - LASCO observes visible light in the corona; specific wavelengths are not detailed in the excerpt.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - CME timing, speed, and angular width (geometric properties of the ejecta).
- **Additional Comments**:
  - LASCO observations are crucial for linking SEP events with their solar eruptions, especially in determining the kinematic properties of the CMEs that drive shock acceleration of particles.

### 5. GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) Instruments
- **General Comments**:
  - The GOES satellites provide 5-minute resolution measurements of proton fluxes and soft X-ray emissions, which are used to determine SEP event onset times and to classify the associated flares.
- **Supporting Quote**:
  - "The second column gives the SEP event onset times based on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 5-minute resolution proton ﬂuxes for energies >100 MeV..." (Section 2.2)
- **Data Collection Period**:
  - The GOES observations referenced are temporally associated with the SEP events (2006–2014) studied by PAMELA.
- **Wavelength(s)**:
  - GOES instruments measure soft X-ray emissions (in the range typical for flare classification) and particle fluxes; exact X-ray wavelength bands are not specified.
- **Physical Observable**:
  - Proton fluxes (for energy >100 MeV) and soft X-ray flux (related to flare intensity).
- **Additional Comments**:
  - GOES data provide a reliable, continuous record of solar activity and SEP onset times, complementing the detailed spectral measurements by PAMELA.
