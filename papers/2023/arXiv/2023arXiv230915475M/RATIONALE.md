produce the script. We need to focus on the specific instruments mentioned in the context, which are SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3. The time range provided is from 1997 to 2018, and the physical observable is the angular width and inclination of CMEs using white-light imaging. Given this information, we can construct a query to retrieve data from the SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 instruments for the specified period. We will use the SunPy library, specifically the Fido interface, to perform these queries. The code should be clear, avoiding complex structures, and directly reflect the data and requirements specified in the context.
